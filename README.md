## Welcome!

This is a first draft of my digital garden, powered by a [[PTN - discourse graph]]. Everything is in progress here, but hopefully helpful starting points!

Some interesting places to start:
- Top-of-mind questions/syntheses:
	- [[QUE - How might domain distance modulate the effects of analogies on creative output]]
	- [[QUE - How can we best bridge private vs. public knowledge]]
	- [[THE - interaction-oriented theory of creative inspiration from examples]]
	- [[QUE - What tension points exist between the goals of diversity and depth of user participation in participatory design]]
- Well-developed claims (connected to evidence):
	- [[CLM - Analogical distance of inspirations for an idea are positively related to the idea's creativity]]
	- [[CLM - creative workers use examples to support problem (re)formulation]]
	- [[CLM - Marginalized user populations may require involvement of extra stakeholders who may complicate hearing the users' voices]]
- Well-connected evidence:
	- [[EVD - Two artists used individual artworks to shape not just their ideas, but used a process of ana...ion. This process unfolded over the course of years. - @okadaAnalogicalModificationCreation2009]]
	- [[EVD - Working with an advocate within the prison system allowed researchers to navigate bureaucratic hierarchy with relative ease - @tengParticipatoryDesignVirtual2019b]]
