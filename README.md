For an intro to this project, see our [start here page](https://scalingsynthesis.com/). This is a work in progress networked notebook, but is ready for sharing. Feel free to make pull requests and suggestions, or comment on pages.

Website made using Quartz.Host your second brain and [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/digital-gardening) for free. Huge shoutout to Jacky Zhao for being so helpful getting this site off the ground to fit our needs.
