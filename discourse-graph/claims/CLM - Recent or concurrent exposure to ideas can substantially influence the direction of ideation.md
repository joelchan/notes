[[QUE - What is the relationship between prior knowledge and new ideas]]

- One effect that is attributed to design [[ðŸ§± fixation]] is the idea that [[[[CLM]] - Recent or concurrent exposure to ideas can substantially influence the direction of ideation]] (the positive side of this is [[[[CLM]] - Examples can improve creative outcomes by stimulating more exploration away from obvious starting points]])

    - Some later work didn't find this effect when people are given instructions.

        - This is reminiscent of the general effects of instructions on creative performance, including [[@gickAnalogicalProblemSolving1980]]

        - Makes me think of the [role of]([[[[CLM]] - Executive functions, such as cognitive control and inhibition, are a net positive for generating creative ideas]]) [[executive function]] in creative work, as a complement/alternative explanation for things like the [[serial order effect]]

            - And a related idea is [[retrieval-induced forgetting]]

                - This leads to the flip side of the activation stuff (kind of like [[ðŸ§± fixation]]): explanation of [[ðŸ§± incubation]] effects in terms of beneficial forgetting [[[[CL]] - Selective forgetting explains incubation effects in creative work]]

                    - Although [[@sioRoleIncubationPeriod2007]]'s results with a RAT didn't support the results

                - The idea here is that activating something in memory (which is what happens when you engage with an example) not only spreads activation to make other ideas more likely, but can also *compete* with other ideas and make them *less* likely to show up. I think this is why [[ðŸ§± fixation]] can feel so powerful

    - One classic paper on this is [[@janssonDesignFixation1991]], who reported that [[[[EVD]] - design students transferred flawed features from an example even though the flaws were described as negative - [[@janssonDesignFixation1991]]]]
