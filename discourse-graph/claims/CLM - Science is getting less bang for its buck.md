    - Description

        - One line of evidence that this is happening is from economics, where we start to see lagging and declining impacts of scientific investment and research on the economy (e.g., [[GDP]] growth and productivity) [[@bloomAreIdeasGetting2020]]

        - Possibly because #[[[[CLM]] - Effective synthesis is hard]] and also [rare]([[[[CLM]] - Effective synthesis is rare]]), since #[[[[CLM]] - Scientific fields stall without adequate theoretical synthesis]]

            - Our [[synthesis]] apparatus was probably ok for a world in which there was less to synthesize, and possibly less [[Scatter]]. But the world has changed (e.g., [[interdisciplinarity]] is way more of a thing, there is way more to synthesize now, way more [[Scatter]]), and our synthesis apparatus has hardly changed at all. So it's quite plausible that our effective synthesis rate would fall quite a bit behind where we need it to be.

            - It's hard to study the level of [[synthesis]] directly (and in particular draw a causal link between that and "progress", which is in itself really tricky to measure, since we rely a lot on scientometrics and bibliometrics, and [[[[CLM]] - Citation practices in science are far from optimal]]), but we have lots of anecdotal evidence at least.

        - Most provocative explanation is that [[Z: Good ideas are getting harder to find]]

        - Alternatively: [[Z: Good ideas are getting harder to translate into impactful applications]], because there is an artificial separation between basic and applied research that is hindering translation

            - see, e.g., [[@aroraChangingStructureAmerican2020]] and [[@rosenthalDeathCorporateResearch2020]] for discussions of this and related papers

            - [[Benjamin Reinhardt]]'s recent podcast episodes with [[Venkatesh Narayanamurti]] [[@reinhardtIdeaMachinesInvention]], former director of [[Bell Labs]], and [[Ashish Arora]] [[@reinhardtIdeaMachinesInventors]] touch on this as well

            - this is also the point that [[Ben Shneiderman]] makes in his book [[@shneidermanNewABCsResearch2016]]
