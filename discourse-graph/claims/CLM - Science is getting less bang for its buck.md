    - Description

        - One line of evidence that this is happening is from economics, where we start to see lagging and declining impacts of scientific investment and research on the economy (e.g., [[GDP]]

        - Possibly because [[CLM - Effective synthesis is hard]]

            - Our [[synthesis]]

            - It's hard to study the level of [[synthesis]]

        - Most provocative explanation is that [[Z Good ideas are getting harder to find]]

        - Alternatively: [[Z Good ideas are getting harder to translate into impactful applications]]

            - see, e.g., [[@aroraChangingStructureAmerican2020]]

            - this is also the point that [[Ben Shneiderman]]
