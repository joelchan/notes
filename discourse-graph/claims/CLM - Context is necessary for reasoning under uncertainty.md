- When building an argument, how can I "converse" with it to get a feel for how strong it is? Not the logic, or the presentation/communication, but the grounding? Keep thinking of an analogy to designing a chair: the wood talks back to you, feels hard or soft in certain places, "complains" when it bends in a certain way. What about [[synthesis]]? Could we design materials for [[synthesis]] that talk back in that way? Is that even possible? [[context]] seems like an important component of this (specifically something like epistemic status or [[[[CLM]] - Context is necessary for reasoning under uncertainty]])

    - Currently, this is done through feedback with others, and..? What cues and affordances are used? Number of citations? Memory of studies? When it goes into a linearized form it becomes hard to reason about, I feel. Outline, during assembly, during prototyping, seems better.

    - Obviously a big part of this is talking to "the world". But I still wonder about connections to [[Bret Victor]]'s idea of seeing [[@victorHumaneRepresentationThought2014]] [[@victorHumaneRepresentationThought2014]]
