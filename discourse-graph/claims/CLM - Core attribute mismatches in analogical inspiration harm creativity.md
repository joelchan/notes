    - # Description

        - ## What is the core idea?

            - There is a logical argument that mismatching core attributes would lead to analogical inferences that cannot really be applied in the target domain .

                - This reminds me of the commonly cited (by us/me) example from [[Bex's lab]]

        - ## What is the evidence for this idea?

            - There is some anecdotal and experimental evidence that [[CLM - People rapidly reject analogical matches when there is a clear attribute mismatch]]

                - {{embed: Description}}

            - This by itself is not strong evidence that attribute mismatches harm creativity, though.

            - There is some experimental evidence that more directly measure the creativity impacts of mismatches in attributes. These studies generally find that [[far analogies]]

                - For example, [[@yuDistributedAnalogicalIdea2016a]([[@yuDistributedAnalogicalIdea2016]]

                    - The core observation here is that __not__ abstracting away the constraints led to creativity gains. While the authors did not directly measure attributes and mismatches on them, it is likely that the constraints encoded some attribute information about the chairs - safety can be a function of many many things, depending on the material (how soft it is, how high up it is, how cool or hot it is, etc.), but if we talk specifically about something not tipping over, then know it's solid, we know it's possible to move (not too heavy), we also infer that the kind of harm probably comes from impact, not from burning or some other means of harm.

                    - The authors interpret the mechanism of the effect in terms of "applicability", motivating the prediction that concrete constraints would be more helpful than abstract constraints with an example from the famous [[Duncker's radiation problem]]

                        - This "applicability" mechanism reminds me of an effect found by Zhu and colleagues [[@zhuContingencyViewTransferring2016]([[@zhuContingencyViewTransferring2016]]

        - ## What is my judgment of the "epistemic" status of this idea?

            - In general, this does not feel like a settled effect, especially given some evidence that [[CLM - Core mismatches in analogical inspiration improve creativity]]
