    - Description

        - A straightforward way to think about analogical innovation is that we get a new solution to a problem by directly transferring a concept from the analogy

        - But there are likely to be significant "indirect" routes of insight as well.

            - For example, [[[[CLM]] - Analogies can power creative breakthroughs by stimulating effective problem (re)formulation]]

    - R-sources

        - and TONS of work being done by [[Julian Francis Vincent]], who we met via [[AskNature]] back in April 2020: one strong [theme](Possible hypothesis: a lot of what is interesting about the way biological systems work that might be useful for engineers is not easily seen ()) he kept hammering was that you have to work alongside the biologists. the whole time. i don't think his critique quite landed at the time: we thought he was talking about user research, involvement in the design process, etc.: but he wasn't! i now believe he was being literal: you got to have the biologist next to you to really get the gold WHILE YOU ARE TRYING TO DO [[biomimicry]] - and he's got the receipts!

            - his approach now is to improve on [[sys/TRIZ]] and basically extend it. but i'm not optimistic this will succeed on its own

- For example, there is some evidence that [[[[CLM]] - Paths to creative breakthroughs are frequently oblique]], and [analogies might be similar]([[[[CLM]] - A significant proportion of the benefits of analogical stimuli is oblique or indirect]]).

    - We sort of inch towards something like this in our experiments with [[Hyeonsu]] ([[WP: Augmenting scientific creativity with analogical inspirations]]), with our ideas about [[generative misalignment]], and focusing more on "creative adaptation" vs. direct application

        - To be more precise, though, we're still evaluating the "worth" of individual ideas, instead of considering its downstream effects, which would be closer to the idea in [[[[THE]] - Accretion theory of ideation]]

    - Another related explanation could be [the oblique nature of analogical inspiration]([[[[CLM]] - A significant proportion of the benefits of analogical stimuli is oblique or indirect]]): rather than an idea or a phrase or picture being "the idea" that you transfer, it may be more accurate to conceptualize a stimulus, such as an [analogous paper]([[analogy]]) as a point/component/spark in a process of inspiration that may lead to a good idea via adapting a direct solution, but also potentially via other routes, such as sparking [[problem (re)formulation]].

    - This, combined with the previous point, may mean that encountering a paper from a different domain, no matter how relevant, may be inert in itself, if it isn't connected to a rich process of inspiration (e.g., reformulation, query)

- I'm struck by the discussion of out of domain examples. Really really really reminiscent of [[[[CLM]] - A significant proportion of the benefits of analogical stimuli is oblique or indirect]]: it's not about direct transfer of features, but of.... *stimulating a conversation*, a rethinking. How does this happen? Through juxtaposition, reinterpretation, conversation.

    - Again, reminds me so much of the richness in [[[[EVD]] - designers used a range of strategies for working with sources of inspiration, ranging from simpler, more source-driven strategies like direct source adaptation, to more complex and reflective strategies like source analysis and schema-driven source selection; complex strategies were more likely to be used by professionals and also more associated with radical transformation of sources - [[@eckertAdaptationSourcesInspiration2003]]]]
