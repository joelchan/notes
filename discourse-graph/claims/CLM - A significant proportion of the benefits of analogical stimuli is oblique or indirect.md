    - Description

        - A straightforward way to think about analogical innovation is that we get a new solution to a problem by directly transferring a concept from the analogy

        - But there are likely to be significant "indirect" routes of insight as well.

            - For example, [[[[CLM]] - Analogies can power creative breakthroughs by stimulating effective problem (re)formulation]]

    - R-sources
