    - Description

        - A straightforward way to think about analogical innovation is that we get a new solution to a problem by directly transferring a concept from the analogy

        - But there are likely to be significant "indirect" routes of insight as well.

            - For example, [[CLM - Analogies can power creative breakthroughs by stimulating effective problem (re)formulation]]

    - R-sources

###### Discourse Context

- **Informs::** [[QUE - What are the mechanisms by which analogies help drive creative breakthroughs]]
- **Informs::** [[QUE - What are the most efficient routes to useful cross-boundary knowledge]]
- **Informs::** [[CLM - Core attribute (mis)matches mediate the benefits of analogies in real-world, complex problem solving]]
- **Informed By::** [[CLM - Analogies can power creative breakthroughs by stimulating effective problem (re)formulation]]
