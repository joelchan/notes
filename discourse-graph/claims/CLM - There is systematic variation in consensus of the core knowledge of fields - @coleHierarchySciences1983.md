    - This is a more qualified version of the [general positive claim]([[[[CLM]] - Scientific fields vary substantially in terms of ease of consensus on judging what constitutes a valuable new contribution]])
[[QUE - How can we measure quality legibility of a field]]

- [[@coleHierarchySciences1983]] argues that basically frontier-level measures (citation concentration, obsolescence, peer review IRR, peer evals) don't give us much signal, but ["core knowledge" measures (e.g., textbooks) probably will]([[[[CLM]] - There is systematic variation in consensus of the core knowledge of fields - [[@coleHierarchySciences1983]]]]).

    - Really need to trace this forward, see whether there are any better signals today with better methods. To their credit, Cole et al were quite upfront about methodological limitations.
