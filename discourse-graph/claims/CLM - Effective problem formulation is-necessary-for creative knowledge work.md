    - Description:

        - Classic [example of]([[SupportedBy]]) this: [[[[EVD]] - Representing a mutilated checkerboard in a way that made perceptual features of squares more salient facilitated problem reformulation and insight - [[@kaplanSearchInsight1990]]]]

        - Other notes (in research):

            - We focus only on problematizing assumptions
that underlie existing literature as a way to construct research questions: problematization challenges existing theories to develop more interesting and influential theories [[@alvessonGeneratingResearchQuestions2011]] [[R: Alvesson2011]].

                - [[R: Sandberg2011]] is another Alvesson work that also applies, e.g. "Ways of constructing research questions: gap-spotting or problematization?" in 2010

            - Maybe the book of  [[R: Campbell1982]]

        - Creative problems are not static ‚Äúgivens‚Äù; rather, these problems are ill-structured and malleable. In contrast to well-structured problems (e.g., the Tower of Hanoi, algebra), where the initial description of the problem sufficiently delineates the goal state and allowable transformations, in creative problem domains, such as innovative design or interdisciplinary research, the ‚Äúproblem statement‚Äù typically underspecifies what the desired solution is. In information-processing terms, ‚Äúthe start state is incompletely specified, the goal state is specified to an even lesser extent, and the transformation function from the start to goal states is completely unspecified‚Äù ([Goel & Pirolli, 1992]([[@goelStructureDesignProblem1992]]), p. 401).

        - In design

            - This property of creative problem spaces leaves room for the artistry of design; an innovative designer can choose to see the design problem differently, to relax certain constraints or redefine certain customer needs in other terms, thereby arriving at innovative solutions. Such problem-reframing has been characterized as key element of creative expertise in design (Cross & Cross 1998; [Schon, 1983]([[@schonReflectivePractitionerHow1983]])).

            - Much attention in the design literature has focused on the malleability of design problem spaces. Bucciarelli (1996) observed in his ethnographic studies of engineering designers that a common strategy was to re-evaluate and sometimes alter formulations of the design problem. Goel and Pirolli ([1992]([[@goelStructureDesignProblem1992]])) call this a ‚Äúreversal of the transformation function‚Äù, where, instead of reducing the difference between the current and goal states by means of a design ‚Äúmove‚Äù (e.g., a particular product configuration), a designer moves closer to the goal state by changing what the goal state is. Similarly, many researchers have emphasized the dynamic co-evolution of both design problem and solution spaces ([Dorst & Cross, 2001]([[@dorstCreativityDesignProcess2001]]); [Rittel & Weber, 1984]([[@rittelDilemmasGeneralTheory1973]]); [Schon, 1983]([[@schonReflectivePractitionerHow1983]]); Simon, 1981).
