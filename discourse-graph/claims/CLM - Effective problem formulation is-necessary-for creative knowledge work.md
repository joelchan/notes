    - Description:

        - Classic [example of]([[SupportedBy]]) this: [[[[EVD]] - Representing a mutilated checkerboard in a way that made perceptual features of squares more salient facilitated problem reformulation and insight - [[@kaplanSearchInsight1990]]]]

        - Other notes (in research):

            - We focus only on problematizing assumptions
that underlie existing literature as a way to construct research questions: problematization challenges existing theories to develop more interesting and influential theories [[@alvessonGeneratingResearchQuestions2011]] [[R: Alvesson2011]].

                - [[R: Sandberg2011]] is another Alvesson work that also applies, e.g. "Ways of constructing research questions: gap-spotting or problematization?" in 2010

            - Maybe the book of  [[R: Campbell1982]]

        - Creative problems are not static “givens”; rather, these problems are ill-structured and malleable. In contrast to well-structured problems (e.g., the Tower of Hanoi, algebra), where the initial description of the problem sufficiently delineates the goal state and allowable transformations, in creative problem domains, such as innovative design or interdisciplinary research, the “problem statement” typically underspecifies what the desired solution is. In information-processing terms, “the start state is incompletely specified, the goal state is specified to an even lesser extent, and the transformation function from the start to goal states is completely unspecified” ([Goel & Pirolli, 1992]([[@goelStructureDesignProblem1992]]), p. 401).

        - In design

            - This property of creative problem spaces leaves room for the artistry of design; an innovative designer can choose to see the design problem differently, to relax certain constraints or redefine certain customer needs in other terms, thereby arriving at innovative solutions. Such problem-reframing has been characterized as key element of creative expertise in design (Cross & Cross 1998; [Schon, 1983]([[@schonReflectivePractitionerHow1983]])).

            - Much attention in the design literature has focused on the malleability of design problem spaces. Bucciarelli (1996) observed in his ethnographic studies of engineering designers that a common strategy was to re-evaluate and sometimes alter formulations of the design problem. Goel and Pirolli ([1992]([[@goelStructureDesignProblem1992]])) call this a “reversal of the transformation function”, where, instead of reducing the difference between the current and goal states by means of a design “move” (e.g., a particular product configuration), a designer moves closer to the goal state by changing what the goal state is. Similarly, many researchers have emphasized the dynamic co-evolution of both design problem and solution spaces ([Dorst & Cross, 2001]([[@dorstCreativityDesignProcess2001]]); [Rittel & Weber, 1984]([[@rittelDilemmasGeneralTheory1973]]); [Schon, 1983]([[@schonReflectivePractitionerHow1983]]); Simon, 1981).

    - Somewhat in parallel, in the domain of design theory and methodology, various theorists have also [[@dorstCoreDesignThinking2011]]

        - Although [[@goelStructureDesignProblem1992]] directly extended Simon's notion of problem spaces to thinking about design spaces

        - And there is a thread of work on trying to model what this space looks like.

    - As early back as [[@newellElementsTheoryHuman1958]], cognitive scientists began to model problem solving as search in a problem space.

        - Within general cognitive science, there are various N-space models

            - [[@klahrDualSpaceSearch1988]] extended the problem space model to account for scientific discovery as joint search in a space of hypotheses and a space of experiments.

        - Quite a few detailed experiments with specific problems (e.g., [[Tower of Hanoi]]) exploring aspects of problem representation

            - One interesting experiment is in [[@kotovskyWhatMakesProblems1990]], which identifies learning about what even constitutes a "move" as a key determinant of a problem's difficulty (in contrast to the size of the search space)

    - The core intuition across these threads is quite straightforward: in order to propose solutions for a problem, you need to have a sense of what the problem is. This allows you to check

    - In a related but separate line of research, more in the Gestalt tradition in cognitive science, research on [[Insight problem solving]] also articulates the centrality of problem representations as a determinant of impasses and problem difficulty, and the need for insight (insufficiency of "basic" procedures). This line of research seeks to explain the phenomenology and mechanics of insight or "Aha" moments, which are described by creators as an experience of an emotion-laden "leap" in progress on a problem: it often feels like solving the problem in one step, particularly after a long period of being stuck.

        - A key reference for this to start with is [[@ohlssonInformationprocessingExplanationsInsight1992]]

        - Key experiments we know about

            - [[[[EVD]] - People were ~2x worse at solving matchstick arithmetic problems when the elements were harder to decompose into chunks - [[@knoblichConstraintRelaxationChunk1999]]]] --> chunk tightness (properties of modal problem representation) are key determinants of problem difficulty and insight

    - If the solution itself still seems amazing and novel after the fact, then probably the ideation of the solution itself was a big part of the contribution; but often, it's the [[problem (re)formulation]] itself that its the major breakthrough, and the progress on this can often be invisible, and the solution afterwards obvious. But it's only obvious **from the new perspective that is enabled by the problem formulation**!

    - In this case, it seems intuitive to me that progress from modeling would have this dominant characteristic, since... what is modeling, but at its core, framing a problem? Finding a way to model it.
