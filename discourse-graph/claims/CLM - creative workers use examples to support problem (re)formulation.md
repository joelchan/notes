        - [[[[EVD]] - Two artists used individual artworks to shape not just their ideas, but used a process of "analogical modification" to search for and modify higher-order concepts, and their creative vision.

    - this thread is sparse, but we might define a task to try to flesh it out more, using our strategies:

        - scite

        - connectedpapers

        - relatedpapers

        - authors

        - they're not super well-connected in citation graph, though.
