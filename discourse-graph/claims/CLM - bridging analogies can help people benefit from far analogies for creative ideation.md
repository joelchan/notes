                - [[[[EVD]] - When provided scaffolding for a similar problem students performed similarly compared to their peers given little scaffolding, however, when asked to solve problems with low similarity the group provided scaffolding performed significantly better. - [[@richlandReducingCognitiveLoad2013]]]]

                - [[[[EVD]] - teachers in countries with high math and science achievement scores also displayed more cognitive supports for analogies, such as bridging analogies, and visuospatial scaffolds for comparison, compared to teachers in a country with lower math and science achievement - [[@richlandCognitiveSupportsAnalogies2007]]]]

                - [[[[EVD]] - giving a bridging analogy to a far analogy for a numerical representations led to better student performance (and more robust explanations of answers) on a math post test compared to no or just the analogy - [[@vamvakoussiBridgingGapDense2012]]]]

    - how to code a transcript selection

        - not be in edit mode

        - select text in the

    - edits/comments

        - factor cases by participant-trial, not participant

            - need to split videos also into the three trials

        - migrate coding references to transcript segments, unless it is primarily visual

            - need to add rough time stamp at the end to recover context

        - nature of codes is great! we may not care about stuff that is about ideas but not analogies, but ok to capture if interesting

        - two big clusters so far: 1) levels/shades of usage

            - might be helpful: [[[[THE]] - interaction-oriented theory of creative inspiration from examples]]

                - see especially [[[[EVD]] - designers used a range of strategies for working with sources of inspiration, ranging from simpler, more source-driven strategies like direct source adaptation, to more complex and reflective strategies like source analysis and schema-driven source selection; complex strategies were more likely to be used by professionals and also more associated with radical transformation of sources - [[@eckertAdaptationSourcesInspiration2003]]]]

            - also [[schema-driven analogizing]]

    - Structure: several studies in education research suggest that providing students with bridging analogies to complex concepts facilitates learning...

            - [[[[EVD]] - When provided instruction using a bridging analogies students had a better understanding of the information being taught, but had trouble putting into the correct context. - [[@savinainenUsingBridgingRepresentation2005]]]]
