    - Description

        - In the way they approach [[problem (re)formulation]]

        - [[@lawsonCognitiveStrategiesArchitectural1979]]

            - Looking more closely at [[@lawsonCognitiveStrategiesArchitectural1979]]

                - Also, the designerly vs. scientist approach led to stronger performance on different problems, and different patterns of errors.
