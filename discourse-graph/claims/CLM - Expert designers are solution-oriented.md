    - Description

        - In the way they approach [[problem (re)formulation]], designers tend to jump in with solution conjectures more quickly, and not spend too much time on problem formulation

        - [[@lawsonCognitiveStrategiesArchitectural1979]] [showed]([[SupportedBy]]) from a [[m/Think-aloud protocols]] study that [[[[EVD]] - science students made more planning errors and fewer structural errors on a spatial block design task; architecture students made fewer planning errors and more structural errors - [[@lawsonCognitiveStrategiesArchitectural1979]]]]

            - Looking more closely at [[@lawsonCognitiveStrategiesArchitectural1979]] alone, I'm not certain about this claim yet. In that study, the task they worked on didn't clearly tap any prior knowledge, so it can't really be explained by "I'm defaulting to solutions because I have a good sense of what might work in this domain", although the task was

                - Also, the designerly vs. scientist approach led to stronger performance on different problems, and different patterns of errors.

        - More of these phenomena are summarized in [[@crossExpertiseDesignOverview2004]], who also notes taht experienced designers' solution-orientation is a function of experience with the problem type (possibly making it less ill-structured)
