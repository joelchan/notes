###### References

[[QUE - How might domain distance modulate the effects of analogies on creative output]]

- I think the first subclaim is the most obvious one: [[[[CLM]] - Analogical distance of inspirations for an idea are positively related to the idea's creativity]]. This is kind of a weak sauce claim, to be honest. A bit too general for my taste.

    - There is some weak [support]([[SupportedBy]]) from an early experiment from [[@dahlInfluenceValueAnalogical2002]] that everyone cites in the creativity/engineering design literature. Two core results relating to [[analogical distance]] come from the third experiment.

        - In the other case, analogical distance was not varied directly in terms of the stimuli, but was manipulated in a "one or more stimuli vs. no stimuli" way. All stimuli were near analogies. They found a __negative__ effect of the near stimuli compared to seeing nothing: [[[[EVD]] - Engineering students who were given one or more near analogies as stimuli generated design ideas that were perceived as less original and valuable by potential customer judges, compared to being given no stimuli - [[@dahlInfluenceValueAnalogical2002]]]]

        - In the one case, analogical distance was measured post-hoc from the analogies that the sample of engineering students turned out to use (think of; not given). They found a __positive__ correlation between % far analogy use and originality/value: [[[[EVD]] - designs that were measured during an ideation session to have come from a higher percentage of far analogies were perceived as more original and valuable by potential customer judges - [[@dahlInfluenceValueAnalogical2002]]]]

    - There's also some [evidence]([[SupportedBy]]) from citation level data that looks at combinations of "knowledge domains" (with journals as a proxy) and finds correlations between having atypical or highly novel combinations of knowledge domains being related to being outliers in terms of citation impact

        - [[[[EVD]] - papers with high median conventionality and high tail atypical combinations of journals they cited were 2x more likely than average to be in top 5 percent of citation distribution - [[@uzziAtypicalCombinationsScientific2013]]]]

        - [[[[EVD]] - highly novel papers were more likely to be in the top 1% of citations in the long run, but not in the short run, and particularly in other fields - [[@wangBiasNoveltyScience2017]]]]

        - [[[[EVD]] - highly novel papers had higher variance in their citation outcomes over a 15-year window, biased towards the higher impact tail of the distribution - [[@wangBiasNoveltyScience2017]]]]

    - There is some [counter-evidence]([[Opposed By]]) from [[m/s/In vivo]] studies of science labs and design teams

        - For example, Dunbar traced the discovery process of four top molecular biology labs, and found that they rarely used far analogies to generate novel scientific concepts: [[[[EVD]] - Molecular biologists with a reputation for innovation rarely used very far analogies in their lab meetings while generating novel scientific concepts; instead, they relied mainly on analogies to the same or other biological organisms - [[@dunbarHowScientistsThink1997]]]]

            - This is a strong result, even though it isn't experimental, due to its high external validity. Despite lack of experimental controls, it at least puts a cap on the claim about far analogies being important/necessary for creative breakthroughs, at least in molecular biology.

        - Dunbar also claims that [[[[CL]] - [[far analogies]] are systematically overrated in their importance for creative breakthroughs due to memory bias - [[@dunbarHowScientistsThink1997]]]]

            - One [support]([[SupportedBy]]) for this is a specific anecdote of tracing a significant discovery through a series of (near) analogies, and then asking the scientist to recall/recount the origins of that discovery: Dunbar found that [[[[EVD]] - A molecular biologist who had made a major scientific conceptual change did not recall any of the spontaneous analogies used to enact that change - [[@dunbarHowScientistsThink1997]]]]

        - Related to this is [[[[EVD]] - In a design team, concepts tended to be more similar to their immediately preceding concepts after far analogy use compared to using near or no analogies - [[@chanImpactAnalogiesCreative2015]]]]. This isn't *quite* a measure of novelty as we normally think of it (the reference for similarity is concepts generated in the last 10 or 5 lines). But it at least opposes the idea that you might be primarily using far analogies to get some distance from where you currently are.

        - A very similar result was found by Saner et al (1999), who found that far analogies were basically never used in reasoning in psychology lab meetings, but were used in colloquia while ideas were being communicated with new audiences: [[[[EVD]] - Far analogies were rare and never used in psychology lab group meetings for reasoning (vs. mere mentions); far analogies were rare in colloquia as well, but were frequently used for reasoning - [[@sanerAnalogiesOutBlue1999]]]]

    - Some complicated, qualified [support]([[SupportedBy]]) also comes from studies that find contingent benefits of far analogies

        - [[[[EVD]] - Far analogies' effects on MechE students' novelty of ideas were different depending on timing: more novel ideas when seeing them after problem solving began vs. before - [[@tsengRoleTimingAnalogical2008]]]]

        - [[[[EVD]] - Far analogies' effects on MechE students' ideation fluency and diversity were different depending on timing: more ideas (but with more functional repeats) before ideation began, vs. more functionally distinct designs after problem solving began (during a break), both compared to seeing nothing - [[@tsengRoleTimingAnalogical2008]]]]

    - And some [support]([[SupportedBy]]) in the form of negative effects of near analogies

        - Near associated with fixation: [[[[EVD]] - Undergrad MechE students who saw near analogies (clocks) for a time-keeping problem preferred discrete (drip-based) solutions to continuous (e.g., flow/fill) solutions - [[@tsengRoleTimingAnalogical2008]]]]

    - And some experimental [counter-evidence]([[Opposed By]]) showing equal effects of near analogies on novelty

        - [[[[EVD]] - In general, MechE students' ideas when given near analogies were at least as novel, and sometimes moreso, then ideas generated with far analogies, or seeing nothing - [[@tsengRoleTimingAnalogical2008]]]]

        - [[[[EVD]] - no overall effect of analogical distance of cases on novelty or usefulness of campaign ad ideas - [[@althuizenSupportingCreativeProblem2014]]]]

        - [[[[EVD]] - overall marginally significant negative effect of analogically distant cases on creativity of campaign ad ideas, mostly for students with high creative ability - [[@althuizenSupportingCreativeProblem2014]]]]

    - Also some [support]([[SupportedBy]]) from [[outsider innovation]] effects

        - [[[[EVD]] - Self-rated technical distance from open innovation contest problems was slightly positively correlated with submitting winning solutions - [[@jeppesenMarginalityProblemsolvingEffectiveness2010]]]]

    - ## Counterarguments

    - [Counter-evidence]([[Opposed By]]) from observational/correlational studies

        - [[[[EVD]] - patents filed by inventors who was new to the patent's field tended to receive slightly fewer citations, except when they collaborated with an expert in the new field - [[@artsParadiseNoveltyLoss2018a]]]]

        - Admittedly underpowered correlational case study from industry: [[[[EVD]] - No significant correlation between analogical distance of cross-industry inspirations and degree of innovation outcome (incremental, market or breakthrough, and radical) - [[@enkelCreativeImitationExploring2010]]]].

            - Note: Most of the cases were drawn from other industries that were quite close by and ((E4MwwsilX)), so probably there is range restriction.

                - Telling that I previously classified this study as "anecdotal"! Yikes... This was a rigorously done multiple-case-study analysis.

                - 25 cases is also really really small for a correlation analysis.

                - I think the most we can say from this is an existence proof that relatively [[near analogies]] can frequently lead to quite innovative outcomes.

        - [[[[EVD]] - greater mean and max conceptual distance of cited inspirations was associated with lower probability of a concept being shortlisted across 12 social innovation design challenges - [[@chanBestDesignIdeas2015]]]]

    - [Evidence]([[SupportedBy]]) from patent studies (at coarser level of granularity)

        - [[[[EVD]] - patents filed by inventors who was new to the patent's field tended to be more novel; this was less true if they collaborated with an expert in the new field - [[@artsParadiseNoveltyLoss2018a]]]]

        - [[[[EVD]] - patenting teams with a greater number of prior patenting fields were more likely to generate patents that were technological outliers - [[@kneelandExploringUnchartedTerritory2020]]]]

    - Some experimental [counter-evidence]([[Opposed By]]) showing the opposite: far < near

        - [[[[EVD]] - participants who received computationally selected far analogical stimuli had a lower ceiling on novelty and quality of ideas compared to participants who received near or no analogical stimuli - [[@fuMeaningFarImpact2013]]]]

    - Weak [[SupportedBy]] from examples

        - [[[[EVD]] - a substantial number of IDEO-designed products incorporated technological solutions from other industries - [[@hargadonTechnologyBrokeringInnovation1997]]]]
