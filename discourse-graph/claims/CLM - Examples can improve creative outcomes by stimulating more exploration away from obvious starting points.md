[[QUE - What is the relationship between prior knowledge and new ideas]]

- One effect that is attributed to design [[ðŸ§± fixation]] is the idea that [[[[CLM]] - Recent or concurrent exposure to ideas can substantially influence the direction of ideation]] (the positive side of this is [[[[CLM]] - Examples can improve creative outcomes by stimulating more exploration away from obvious starting points]])

    - Some later work didn't find this effect when people are given instructions.

        - This is reminiscent of the general effects of instructions on creative performance, including [[@gickAnalogicalProblemSolving1980]]

        - Makes me think of the [role of]([[[[CLM]] - Executive functions, such as cognitive control and inhibition, are a net positive for generating creative ideas]]) [[executive function]] in creative work, as a complement/alternative explanation for things like the [[serial order effect]]

            - And a related idea is [[retrieval-induced forgetting]]

                - This leads to the flip side of the activation stuff (kind of like [[ðŸ§± fixation]]): explanation of [[ðŸ§± incubation]] effects in terms of beneficial forgetting [[[[CL]] - Selective forgetting explains incubation effects in creative work]]

                    - Although [[@sioRoleIncubationPeriod2007]]'s results with a RAT didn't support the results

                - The idea here is that activating something in memory (which is what happens when you engage with an example) not only spreads activation to make other ideas more likely, but can also *compete* with other ideas and make them *less* likely to show up. I think this is why [[ðŸ§± fixation]] can feel so powerful

- ### Stimulate: [[[[CLM]] - Examples can improve creative outcomes by stimulating more exploration away from obvious starting points]]

    - The most basic functional outcome is that examples can directly shape ideation by providing features or conceptual elements to use, or priming a direction of thinking:

    - Here, the observables are high similarity between the example and the idea that it inspires. This isn't necessarily a bad thing!

    - Most basic result is that features get transferred over directly from examples. This happens whether we want it to or not. It's called [[cryptomnesia]], [[ðŸ§± fixation]], [[conformity effect]], and [[structured imagination]] in psych studies.

        - [[[[EVD]] - Undergrads' drawings of imaginary animals frequently included typical features from earth animals, with occasional deviations - [[@wardStructuredImaginationRole1994]]]]

        - [[[[EVD]] - design students transferred flawed features from an example even though the flaws were described as negative - [[@janssonDesignFixation1991]]]]

            - a few other problems, and [also for professionals]([Professional structural design engineers](((ThoPyJe5b))) who [were shown an example](((XNP7iOLs5))) (flawed, but flaws not stated) design for a disposable coffee cup were approximately 2X more likely to include key features from the example design in [their own brainstormed designs](((vlqhHRHsI))), compared to engineers who didn't see the example; both sets of engineers generated similar numbers of total design ideas) (though not domain experts; structural design doing product design)

    - I think it's clear that this level of functional outcome is the riskiest! You gotta get lucky with a feature to transfer or adapt to your setting!

    - The other basic result is that examples' features can shape ideation by shaping what other ideas are available, through [[spreading activation]] and [[priming]]

        - This chain of thinking is the basic prediction of [[[[THE]] - Search in Associative Memory (SIAM)]] from [[@nijstadHowGroupAffects2006]]: they're trying to explain how group ideation works, and under what conditions it can be better than individual ideation. Here we can think of ideas from others as "examples"; the basic notion here is that ideas from others act as "cues" to shape what the activated set of associated memories is.

        - Spreading activation is a known and influential model of how memory works

            - Ideas are constructed, at least partially, from information in memory

            - Priming is a means for influencing activation (see, e.g., [[@mcnamaraPrimingConstraintsIt1992]])

                - An example

                - Whether this happens at a more abstract level with social priming is still an open question. However, semantic priming at a cognitive level is well established.

        - Original canonical cite for spreading activation is [[@collinsSpreadingactivationTheorySemantic1975]]

        - Some quibbles about the details of the model (e.g., [[@ratcliffDoesActivationReally1981]]), but the basic idea that "things you see will shape what else you think of" is quite robust

        - Empirical stuff:

            - More ideas alone after seeing idea from others

                - also cc [[[[CL]] - Alternating individual and group ideation is better for group creative work than individual or group work alone]]

    - Finally, examples can set "benchmarks" maybe??

    - note: people can still do more with examples than just view them, esp. if they're experts! that's what we see often with the expert designers. but affordances for analysis, like [product dissection](Thinking of product dissection stuff from [[@tohImpactExampleModality2014]]), or tools/worklfows like [[obscure features]]
