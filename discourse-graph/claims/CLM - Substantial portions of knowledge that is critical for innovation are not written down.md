- [[context]] is especially important for [[synthesis]] when navigating [[interdisciplinarity]]: what is usually subtext is now hidden entirely (since [[[[CLM]] - Substantial portions of knowledge that is critical for innovation are not written down]]), yet must also become front and center as the researcher needs to figure out whether and how ideas transfer from one setting to another.

    - I'm thinking of the example from the [[P: COVID-19 treatment search]] folks where a simple lack of [[context]] around a shared term led to very different understanding of what was being talked about

- Quote from paper about [[trading zones]] that might be connected to the idea that [[[[CLM]] - Substantial portions of knowledge that is critical for innovation are not written down]], and also our [[D/Synthesis Infrastructure]] [[vision of]] [[idea: multiplayer zettelkastens]]: Individuals and groups can explore and grab things from a "marketplace" or network of "notes" (the nebulous thing we will enable individuals to create: partial visions for now include [[Digital Garden]]s and [[sys/Zettelkasten]]s)

    - Going back again to the connection to [[ðŸ§± foraging]]: we want to move beyond "find me relevant papers", to "help me find relevant knowledge pieces"

- One explanation might be that [[[[CLM]] - Substantial portions of knowledge that is critical for innovation are not written down]], and are instead "in the heads" of people.

    - This is partially because [[[[CLM]] - Knowledge is fundamentally contextual]]. It is partially on this basis that [[[[CLM]] - CSCW research on knowledge sharing shifted from a repository model to an expertise sharing model around the mid-2000's - [[@ackermanSharingKnowledgeExpertise2013]]]]

    - IDEO tries to address this problem by incorporating people into the mix

        - EVD:: Much of the knowledge of potential solutions resides in the minds of the individual designers as products they had seen or used before, projects they had worked on, or technologies they had read, heard, or talked about

        - EVD:: By knowing who had worked previously on what projects, they could often direct designers to individuals with relevant knowledge.

        - [[[[EVD]] - Technical design knowledge at IDEO that was used for analogical inspiration resided in a mix of artifacts, prototypes, and designers' memories, and was actively maintained through routines of access in design work - [[@hargadonTechnologyBrokeringInnovation1997]]]]

            - especially designers as points of access (understood from managers) to diverse porfolios of knowledge as they deepened their expertise in a few domains

    - this gets at the point that literature on its own would be far from sufficient, perhaps especially in the case of [[interdisciplinarity]], because people writing for a disciplinary audience will probably assume their audience knows things you don't, and consequently leave them out from what is actually written down
