    - Description:

        - Creativity theory claims that conceptual combination is fundamental to creative thought.

        - [[Liane Gabora]] feels very strongly about this.

            - "[actualization of potentiality] is central to our model of concept combination (which we view as the heart of the creative process): Aerts, D., Gabora, L., & Sozzo, S. (2013). Concepts and their dynamics: A quantum-theoretical modeling of human thought.Â __Topics in Cognitive Science__,Â __5__(4), 737-772. [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1069)]" (email exchange from 1/20/20)

            - If I understand it correctly, Liane's approach of using [[quantum theory]] (see, e.g., [[@aertsConceptsTheirDynamics2013a]]) to model concepts makes [[Atomicity]] important, but also inextricably tied to [[context]]. This is also a central idea in [[Niklas Luhmann]]'s idea of the [[sys/Zettelkasten]], where individual notes (which are supposed to represent individual "ideas") obtain their meaning only by being connected to other ideas; that is, their meaning is determined by the context of the notes they are connected to.
