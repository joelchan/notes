    - Description:

        - [[ðŸ§± sensemaking]] shares the property of [[[[CLM]] - Synthesis is creating a new whole out of component parts]]. But doesn't necessarily add the [[[[CL]] - Clearer cases of synthesis involve substantial conceptual innovation]]

        - Potentially #redundant-with (or a reason that) #[[Z: Sensemaking models partially model scholarly synthesis as of [[April 21st, 2020]]]]

        - #Claim There are two core concepts for synthesis: 1) creating a new whole from parts, and 2) displaying at least some level of __conceptual__ innovation (higher = clearer case of synthesis) [[@strikeTypesSynthesisTheir1983]]

- Along these lines, we need to think very carefully about #[[Z: Sensemaking models partially model scholarly synthesis as of [[April 21st, 2020]]]] and #[[[[CLM]] - Synthesis is sensemaking on "hard mode"]], because that will probably be our first place to look to derive principles of the **data models** for systems that support synthesis.

    - Although efforts like #[[@russellBeingLiterateLarge2006]] and #[[@russellCostStructureSensemaking1993]] and #[[@pirolliSensemakingProcessLeverage2005]] seem to target more **__process__**-level frictions, and not as much the data model / artifacts themselves.

        - Slight exception from #[[@russellBeingLiterateLarge2006]]: Good example on p5: if "moving" a paper is costly, people do it a lot less

    - [[context]] is critical, because we never want the pieces to be frozen: might want to to [[chunk decomposition]], for example

    - The two general loops of [[ðŸ§± foraging]] (finding stuff) and [[ðŸ§± sensemaking]] (analysing, structuring and composing stuff) are crucial to frame the process model and workflows.

        - So in this sense, I agree with [[I- Search as a part of the primitive design]]

    - A possible implication of [this](It is very very important to note the fact that these are loops, and they overlap: they are conceptually distinct processes, but they interleave heavily in practice. ) is that systems and data structures that create separations between these loops, hamper the overall process of sensemaking.

        - Typical search engines stop short of sensemaking, providing only rudimentary and coarse ways to **make sense of** what is foraged, allowing for coarse bookmarking or maybe sorting into collections, but no **thinking** on it.

            - A notable exception is [[sys/BentoBrowser]] [[@hahnBentoBrowserComplex2018]], and its later iteration [[sys/Fuse]] (which is moving towards commercialization of the idea and pushing it beyond mobile)

                - "consumer" version of this (from a separate group) is [[sys/Knovigator]]

            - The practice of importing bookmarks manually or automatically (through [[sys/Readwise]] or [[sys/Hypothes.is]], for example), into a hypertext notebook space for sensemaking, like [[sys/Obsidian]] and [[sys/RoamResearch]], also points to a [[Desire Path]] for higher-levels of complexity in integrating foraging and sensemaking (iteratively connecting data to structure)

        - Annotation and bookmarking systems have a similar issue. There are ways to provide notes at best, and organizing into tags and collections (see, e.g., [[sys/Readwise]]), but iterative integration with the sensemaking loop is poor.

    - It is very very important to note the fact that these are loops, and they overlap: they are conceptually distinct processes, but they interleave heavily in practice.

    - The most recent comprehensive theoretical process model of the sensemaking loop is in [[@zhangpengyiComprehensiveModelCognitive2014]].

        - Notice that even there there is a "data loop" (information-seeking), and a structure loop.

    - The best model for [[ðŸ§± foraging]] is

    - Models of [[ðŸ§± sensemaking]] have a looooong history, starting independently in cognitive science and information science, as far back as the 40s. They've been developed theoretically, as well as empirically, often with decades of research on intelligence analysts.

        - This population was chosen for a couple reasons, I believe: 1) it's a good prototype of a very complex sensemaking task, and 2) there's a lot of money (from military) to be tied to making this better!

    - The looping structure (where structure *emerges* in interaction with data, rather than determined a priori, during complex sensemaking) is a reason that [[[[PTN]] - incremental formalization]] is a powerful design pattern.
