[[CLM - Synthesis work requires explicit (usually external) representations of both evidence and claims]]

- Let's look at some examples that others have documented of the [lossy claim+citation telephone game]([[[[CLM]] - Citation practices in science are far from optimal]]):

    - [[@harzingPersistentMythHigh1995]] is another really striking example, arguing that "there is almost no empirical foundation for the existence of high failure rates when measured as premature re-entry. The persistent myth of high expatriate failure rates seems to have been created by massive (mis)quotations of three articles. Only one of these articles contained solid empirical evidence on expatriate failure rates and in fact showed them to be rather low"

    - [[[[EVD]] - A style guide example citation (not a real paper) was copied by more than 10 later papers to support claims of therapeutic effects of Rutin - [[@lengPhantomReferencePropagation2020]]]]

    - We report a method of estimating what percentage of people who cited a paper had actually read it. The method is based on a stochastic modeling of the citation process that explains empirical studies of misprint distributions in citations (which we show follows a Zipf law). Our estimate is only about 20% of citers read the original.

    - #example-of [[affirmative citation bias]] [[[[CLM]] - Citation practices in science are far from optimal]]

    - It's worth noting that as an aggregate signal of quality, number of citations (w/ various transformations) works ok, and seems to reveal much about the social and institituional structure of science, but as a means for systematically tracing lines of evidence, I worry a lot about the quality of the input data. This is why i find @scite indispensable. Though it is limited by the quality of the input data.

    - counterpoint: lagging indicators, [[[[CLM]] - bibliometric measures are biased against novel breakthrough research - [[@wangBiasNoveltyScience2017]]]] what do we lose by continuing to rely on this "great man" heuristic? and increasingly so as the number of papers grows?

        - [[[[EVD]] - highly novel papers were more likely to be in the top 1% of citations in the long run, but not in the short run, and particularly in other fields - [[@wangBiasNoveltyScience2017]]]]
