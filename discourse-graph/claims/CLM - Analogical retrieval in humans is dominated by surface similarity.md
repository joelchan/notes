- People can make both near or far-field analogies (Dunbar, 1995; Dunbar & Blanchette, 2001; Vosniadou & Ortony, 1989), but near-field analogies seem to be easier to use than far-field ones â€“ this seems to be an access problem. [[[[CLM]] - Analogical retrieval in humans is dominated by surface similarity]]

    - Near-field analogies share lots of superficial details with target analogs (Christensen & Schunn, 2007), and thus are more easily accessed in memory (Gentner, Rattermann, & Forbus, 1993; Holyoak & Koh, 1987; see also the POLR of Ward, 1998 and other theories of [[unconscious plagiarism]]) â€“ representations are more active due to associative priming?

    - Distant analogies are often harder to access, possibly because of domain differences (Johnson-Laird, 1989)
