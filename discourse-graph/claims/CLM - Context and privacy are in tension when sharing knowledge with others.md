    - Description

        - There is an immense amount of value in personal knowledge graphs, whether they are represented in a latent way as a linear notebook, or (as is increasingly the case) as personal wikis or [[[[PTN]] - hypertext notebooks]]

        - Personal knowledge graphs used to be a niche domain of [[Hackers]], but, with the rise of tools like [[[[ART]] - RoamResearch]] and [[sys/TiddlyWiki]], is slowly but surely making its way through [[Explorers]] and even [[Virtuosos]] [[@chanWhereRubberMeets2020]].

        - As adoption of these resources grows, we are approaching critical mass of knowledge that could yield significant value if linked and/or made shareable in some way.

        - This means the vision of augmenting collective intelligence through [[sys/Federated Wikis]] is becoming less of a pipe dream, and more of a thing we might want to figure out how to actually do.

        - There is a critical problem here around the tension between [[privacy]] and [[context]] though, which we need to solve if we want to answer [[[[QUE]] - How can we best bridge private vs. public knowledge?]]

        - Personal knowledge graphs gain their power by being open and densely connected, without regard for ordinary boundaries between work and not-work and between projects. #[[Z]]

            - The power of networked thinking comes from breaking down artificial silos between knowledge, to power [[analogy]] and [[ðŸ§± conceptual combination]], ultimately enabling a more sophisticated level of knowledge [[synthesis]].

            - For example, often, important [[context]] for ideas comes from the knowledge worker's personal assessment of the credibility of ideas.

            - These assessments can be quite personal and preliminary, such as downweighting a claim from a lab with a known (but not public) history of p-hacking or sensationalism until it is replicated by other labs.

            - Consider, for example, how [[Darwin's notebooks]] mixed in intensely personal musings and fears with incremental insights that were crucial for developing his theory of evolution [[@gruberDarwinManPsychological1974]].

                - In particular, his wrestling with the evidentiary gaps in his theory was intertwined with his musings about his reluctance to "go public" with his theory, given the hostile atmosphere for scientific explanations that left out a role of the Divine.

            - A related example: [[Isaac Newton]] took alchemy seriously [[@dryNewtonPapersStrange2014]]! He wrote extensively about it in his personal notes and private manuscripts, which you can view for yourself in the [online archive](https://www.newtonproject.ox.ac.uk/texts/newtons-works/alchemical) of his notes.

            - As another example, today, many users of [[[[PTN]] - hypertext notebooks]] like [[[[ART]] - RoamResearch]] freely mix the personal and the professional, and cross mention people, resources, and data across projects.

            - This blurring between the private and the public, between this-project and that-project, and between the personal and the professional, is incredibly generative for creative work.

            - But it also poses a serious challenge to any effort to make these graphs available in some way to others, whether directly, or through some kind of [[federation]] system.

            - How do we protect unauthorized or unwanted access to ideas and thoughts that might lead to harm for the knowledge sharer?

        - Well, you might say, let's just share the stuff that's ready to be shared, then, and only those things! Just the public-ready stuff. But there is a related challenge here that makes this problem harder: [[[[CLM]] - Knowledge must be recontextualized to be usefully reused]].

            - Without understanding why an idea was written, how it relates to other ideas, what its precise meaning is in the [[context]] of the knowledge sharer, and how that idea is warranted or grounded in observations, details, and evidence, the "mileage" of that piece of information is extremely limited.

            - The implication of this is that sharing __only__ entry points into a knowledge graph will likely severely blunt their usefulness for others.

        - So the challenge is really: How do we provide enough [[context]] in entry points from a knowledge graph to benefit the knowledge reuser, while protecting the [[privacy]] of the knowledge sharer?
