    - Description

        - [[@kaneMultidisciplinaryTeamMeetings2007]] Basically says that these [interdisciplinary]([[interdisciplinarity]]) teams [need to meet A LOT](((f38DmnLbp))); possibly too much to sustain [*](((fNh1Ct0UU)))

        - reminds me of how [[synthesis centers]] struggle to keep afloat [[@baronSynthesisCentersCritical2017]], and the [[leeway]] needed to sustain [[interdisciplinarity]] ([[@palmerWorkBoundariesScience2001]]) [*](reminds me of how [[synthesis centers]] struggle to keep afloat [[@baronSynthesisCentersCritical2017]], and the [[leeway]] needed to sustain [[interdisciplinarity]] ([[@palmerWorkBoundariesScience2001]]))

- But there is a very [significant barrier]([[[[CLM]] - Interdisciplinary teamwork is hard]]) to team-based [[Convergence]] because of this bottleneck of not being able to have a shared "dataset" of ideas that satisfy the properties. Our external representations that are **shareable** lack one or more of those properties. We've designed models for some that could have these properties, but nobody will use them.

- we also make an argument about [[interdisciplinarity]]: [[[[CLM]] - Interdisciplinary teamwork is hard]], and this paper might be relevant:

- [[[[CLM]] - The most transformative insights must come from a single "mind"]] and [[[[CLM]] - Interdisciplinary teamwork is hard]]

    - This might be one reason that [[Andy Matuschak]] and [[Michael Nielsen]] think that [[[[CLM]] - The most transformative insights must come from a single "mind"]]. Because it's really challenging to (or we haven't yet figured out how to) enable a medium with data model properties of [[compression]], [[context]], and [[compositionality]] that spans multiple minds; a distributed system that enfolds or spans more than one mind and their workflow.

        - Our current workaround is to have people spend LOTS of time together in an intense collaboration to get to the point where this is possible, or to have people who are very similar already get together.
