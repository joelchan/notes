- [[@simontonVarietiesScientificCreativity2009]] claims this, but doesn't provide direct evidence, instead pointing to, among others, [[@coleHierarchySciences1983]], which is itself mostly a secondary source of primary sources (except for a pilot analysis of textbook content)

###### Discourse Context

- **Informs::** [[QUE - (How) do fields of innovation vary in their legibility of quality]]
- **Supported By::** [[EVD - most undergrad 1980s textbooks in physics and chemistry cited work published before 1960; sociology texts mostly cited work published after 1960 - @coleHierarchySciences1983]]
- **Supported By::** [[EVD - undergrad 1980s textbooks in physics and chemistry cited far fewer texts compare to sociology textbooks - @coleHierarchySciences1983]]
- **Supported By::** [[EVD - statistically significant but small differences in bibliometric measures of consensus across ...cal, hard and soft biological, and social sciences  - @fanelliBibliometricEvidenceHierarchy2013]]
- **Informed By::** [[@simontonVarietiesScientificCreativity2009]]

    - [[@coleHierarchySciences1983]] basically clarifies and sharpens this claim because they don't find any evidence for this, and instead have reviewed a bunch of papers and conclude the [opposite]([[Opposed By]]) in terms of the research frontier:

        - [[[[CLM]] - There is no systematic variation in consensus across fields on judging quality of contributions to research frontiers - [[@coleHierarchySciences1983]]]]

    - But [[@coleHierarchySciences1983]] also find some limited/scoped evidence in [support]([[SupportedBy]]):

        - [[[[EVD]] - most undergrad 1980s textbooks in physics and chemistry cited work published before 1960; sociology texts mostly cited work published after 1960 - [[@coleHierarchySciences1983]]]]
