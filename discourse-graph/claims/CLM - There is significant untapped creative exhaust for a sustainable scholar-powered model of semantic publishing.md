- [[scholar-powered model of semantic publishing]]
- Compare [citizen science](((S8U6tuXwB))) to ~700k full-time faculty (in [[2018]]

    - this is an INSANE amount of labor, and does not include estimates from students (undergraduate and graduate), as well as part-time faculty or postdocs, [[independent researchers]]

    - all of this labor benefits primarily a single person, with some spillover benefits to the community through sharing of learnings... but not in "raw" form. often, people who hear about a finding, if they really want ot use it, have to re-extract it

        - sort of like... every software engineer writing code from scratch, with basically no reusable modules. INSANITY!
- so this works out to {{[[calc]]
- NOTE! [Estimates](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+many+papers+published+per+year&oq=how+many+papers+published+per+year&aqs=chrome.0.0j0i22i30j69i64l2.3117j1j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) vary, but we're looking at order of magnitude maybe ~60M research papers total that have ever been published, with [about ~2M](http://blog.cdnsciencepub.com/21st-century-science-overload/#:~:text=According%20to%20research%20from%20the,papers%20are%20published%20each%20year.) [more added per year](https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20180905095203579)

    - and certainly not all of these papers need to be processed! retractions, junk science, predatory journals, etc.

    - the shoe fits!

    - say this another way: if we succeed at solving the [authoring bottleneck for semantic publishing]([[CLM - The central bottleneck to synthesis infrastructures is authoring]]
- another way to look at this: [[@wareSTMReportOverview2015]]
