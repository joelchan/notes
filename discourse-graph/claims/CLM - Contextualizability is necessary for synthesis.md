    - Description:

        - We see this in scholars' behavior during synthesis: for example, [[[[CLM]] - Scholars constantly need to reread during a literature review]].

        - It is possible that with good contextualizability properties, less rereading is necessary; but there is probably a base level of returning that needs to happen, since [[[[CLM]] - Synthesis is sensemaking on "hard mode"]] and [[[[CLM]] - Sensemaking requires iterative loops of (re)interpreting data in light of evolving schemas]]

        - Informally, we observe that balancing and preserving coupling/grounding between the "layers of evidence" is challenging

        - For these reasons, we claim that the level of contextualizability puts an upper limit on how deep/effective/rich of a synthesis can be achieved.

            - [[[[CL]] - People process complex information in multiple levels and stages of processing]] may be necessary to achieve useful [[Atomicity]]

        - The larger point is that [[[[CLM]] - Knowledge must be recontextualized to be usefully reused]], because [[[[CLM]] - Knowledge is fundamentally contextual]]

        - However, [[[[CLM]] - Specifying context for future reuse is costly]].

    - R-Sources:

        - the idea of evaluation and clear criteria for gaps is an important observation that connects with why [[context]] matters. #[[@granelloPromotingCognitiveComplexity2001]]
