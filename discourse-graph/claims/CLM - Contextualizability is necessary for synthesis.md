    - Description:

        - We see this in scholars' behavior during synthesis: for example, [[CLM - Scholars constantly need to reread during a literature review]]

        - It is possible that with good contextualizability properties, less rereading is necessary; but there is probably a base level of returning that needs to happen, since [[CLM - Synthesis is sensemaking on hard mode]]

        - Informally, we observe that balancing and preserving coupling/grounding between the "layers of evidence" is challenging

        - For these reasons, we claim that the level of contextualizability puts an upper limit on how deep/effective/rich of a synthesis can be achieved.

            - [[CLM - People process complex information in multiple levels and stages of processing]]

        - The larger point is that [[CLM - Knowledge must be recontextualized to be usefully reused]]

        - However, [[CLM - Specifying context for future reuse is costly]]

    - R-Sources:

        - the idea of evaluation and clear criteria for gaps is an important observation that connects with why [[context]]
