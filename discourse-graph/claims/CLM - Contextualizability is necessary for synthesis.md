    - Description:

        - We see this in scholars' behavior during synthesis: for example, [[[[CLM]] - Scholars constantly need to reread during a literature review]].

        - It is possible that with good contextualizability properties, less rereading is necessary; but there is probably a base level of returning that needs to happen, since [[[[CLM]] - Synthesis is sensemaking on "hard mode"]] and [[[[CLM]] - Sensemaking requires iterative loops of (re)interpreting data in light of evolving schemas]]

        - Informally, we observe that balancing and preserving coupling/grounding between the "layers of evidence" is challenging

        - For these reasons, we claim that the level of contextualizability puts an upper limit on how deep/effective/rich of a synthesis can be achieved.

            - [[[[CL]] - People process complex information in multiple levels and stages of processing]] may be necessary to achieve useful [[Atomicity]]

        - The larger point is that [[[[CLM]] - Knowledge must be recontextualized to be usefully reused]], because [[[[CLM]] - Knowledge is fundamentally contextual]]

        - However, [[[[CLM]] - Specifying context for future reuse is costly]].

    - R-Sources:

        - the idea of evaluation and clear criteria for gaps is an important observation that connects with why [[context]] matters. #[[@granelloPromotingCognitiveComplexity2001]]

- #example-of [[[[CLM]] - Contextualizability is necessary for synthesis]]: [[@hsiaoVisualizingEvidencebasedDisagreement2020]] different [[systematic review]]s between 2002 and 2014 came to very different conclusions on dietary salt

    - the main thing i wonder is how much of this #context (the nature of evdience that was draw on) is salient in the review, also to teh extent that prior reviews are referenced!

- the **units **need to be [compress(able)]([[[[CLM]] - Compression is necessary for synthesis]]) and [contextualizable]([[[[CLM]] - Contextualizability is necessary for synthesis]]).

    - this is a variation and expansion of the argument we make in [[@qianITunesPapersRedefining2019a]]

    - this is the proper target of the [[Grant proposal for Synthesis Infrastructure - NSF CHS / SOS 2020]]

    - and these together are probably sufficient for making substantial gains towards much better [[collective intelligence]] and a [[peer-to-peer]] [[infrastructure]] for [[synthesis]]

- [[[[context]]ualizability]] #[[[[CLM]] - Contextualizability is necessary for synthesis]]

    - Synthesizers should be able to ^^put ideas in context^^, by adding details that might be relevant, understanding how the ideas relate to other ideas, etc.

    - An effective synthesis shouldn't just be novel: it should be "valuable" or "true" in some sense. This means it needs to be "grounded" in the data. Another way to think about this is that contextualizability puts the "brakes" on the speculation and novelty of re-interpretation enabled by atomicity.

        - Reinterpretation will involve [[reuse]] of knowledge outside of its original [[context]]. Which is great! But it's important to sort out "ok/useful" stretching and reuse, and "bad/unfounded" ones. This is what's studied in the [[CSCW]] tradition of research on reuse, which has found that #[[[[CLM]] - Knowledge must be recontextualized to be usefully reused]]

    - Why is this important for synthesis?

    - An important angle to this, too, is that [[[[CLM]] - Substantial portions of knowledge that is critical for innovation are not written down]], because [[[[CLM]] - Knowledge is fundamentally contextual]]

    - Recall also that > A quality [[synthesis]] will clarify and resolve, rather than obscure inconsistencies or tensions between material synthesized #[[@strikeTypesSynthesisTheir1983]]

                - some types of [[context]] information were more contextual, depending on the particular "hypothesis projection" of the review, which varied across the lifecycle of the project studied (e.g., location of medical condition, amount of exposure, confounding risk factors), while others were more constant regardless of hypothesis (e.g., study- and population-context information)

                - [[@blakeCollaborativeInformationSynthesis2006]]: director of the public health group estimated that she spent ~3 hrs per article to extract [[context]] information required  for a particular [[systematic review]]
