    - Description

        - Faculty have high stated expectations for [[synthesis]], but reviews of dissertation committee comments on doctoral dissertation literature reviews demonstrate that the bar for synthesis is substantially lower in practice than what faculty's stated expectations.

        - The #canonical reference for this right now is [[@holbrookLevelsSuccessUse2008]], which synthesizes findings from [[@holbrookInvestigatingPhDThesis2004]] and [[@lovittsMakingImplicitExplicit2007]].

            - Ineffective [[synthesis]] is not a reason to fail a dissertation! Qualities associated with literature reviews in "acceptable" (or even "very good")  dissertations fall well short of implicit and explicit criteria for effective synthesis (e.g., [[@strikeTypesSynthesisTheir1983]], [[@booteScholarsResearchersCentrality2005]]

- Fun discussion with [[Yongsung Kim]] about ideas for tools for improving [[synthesis]] for novices (cf. [[challenges that students face doing lit reviews]] and [[[[CLM]] - Doctoral students struggle to effectively synthesize literature]])

    - Two main buckets of ideas:

        - 1: [[Metacognition]] - task is extremely complex, and it's tough to keep track of the many goals you have and assess how things are going. Wondering if this metacognitive and process-level expertise is what can be learned (still have to do some hard work of learning a new domain, but armed with process expertise, you can "[trust the process](Really inspired by this thought from [[Beck Tench]]: https://www.becktench.com/blog/2018/11/12/using-zettelkasten-and-tinderbox-to-document-a-literature-review - do you have a process that you can trust and lean on, like the design process, for example?)").

            - It might be useful to try to learn the components of this process expertise by studying what experts do, but not just in their wheelhouse: inspired by [[R: schunnGeneralitySpecificityExpertise1999]], we could have experts try to synthesize literature for a topic that is outside their core expertise (or even discipline, maybe), and analyze what process-level expertise they might bring in that a novice (to both the process and the domain) might not.

            - One caution: strategies that are available to experts might not be viable/tractable for novices (e.g., chunking requirements, confidence, etc.); and some of the steps that an expert might skip might be necessary [[desirable difficulty]] for a novice

        - 2: Aiding in the {{alias: [[Learning Loop Complex]] search for representations}} during the [[ðŸ§± sensemaking]] process, maybe with some of the tools we've developed in [[D/Computational Analogy]]

            - Labeling purposes and mechanisms and clustering based on that
