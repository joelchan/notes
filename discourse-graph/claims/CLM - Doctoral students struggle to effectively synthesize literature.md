    - Description

        - Faculty have high stated expectations for [[synthesis]], but reviews of dissertation committee comments on doctoral dissertation literature reviews demonstrate that the bar for synthesis is substantially lower in practice than what faculty's stated expectations.

        - The #canonical reference for this right now is [[@holbrookLevelsSuccessUse2008]], which synthesizes findings from [[@holbrookInvestigatingPhDThesis2004]] and [[@lovittsMakingImplicitExplicit2007]].

            - Ineffective [[synthesis]] is not a reason to fail a dissertation! Qualities associated with literature reviews in "acceptable" (or even "very good")  dissertations fall well short of implicit and explicit criteria for effective synthesis (e.g., [[@strikeTypesSynthesisTheir1983]], [[@booteScholarsResearchersCentrality2005]]
