    - Description

        - There is anecdotal and empirical evidence that most private annotations are not useful to other people.

        - Why might this be? One reason might be that [[context]] is missing, and [[[[CLM]] - Knowledge must be recontextualized to be usefully reused]]

    - R-Sources

        - [[@marshallExploringRelationshipPersonal2004]]

            - Most (~70-80%) private [[annotation]]s are not useful to other people (p. 354)

            - People frequently need to make substantial changes to [[annotation]]s ot make them useful to other people (p. 354)

    - Possibly because [[[[CLM]] - Knowledge must be recontextualized to be usefully reused]], and [[[[CLM]] - Specifying context for future reuse is costly]]

    - But also possibly because a lot of what we do in terms of externalization is [[Epistemic Action]] that *is* thinking in the moment, not necessarily producing a record that will be in any way useful after the moment. #[[ðŸŒ² zettels]]

    - Study sharing dynamics as functino of note characteristics

        - Can do in parallel to  / before [[[[PTN]] - flexible compression]] prototyps are done

        - And also with design probes
