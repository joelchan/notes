    - Description

        - Examples:

            - [[[[EVD]] - Charles Darwin's ideas about the evolution of man existed in quite well-developed form in his notebooks 34 years prior to their publication in the Descent of Man - [[@gruberDarwinManPsychological1974]]]]

            - decades for mRNA tech to mature to vaccines: see [this graphic](Powerful example of how [[[[CLM]] - True creative breakthroughs often take a long time to develop]]

            - funcitonal flow cytometry (basically a new way to do super-specific and super-sensitive detection of radioactivity) - 60+ years! [[@kneelandExploringUnchartedTerritory2020]]'s idea of [[long search paths]]

        - Why might this be?

            - Some of this is intrinsic. For example, [[[[CLM]] - Paths to creative breakthroughs are frequently oblique]]

            - But some of this is resistance from the field, especially when the route is via [[outsider innovation]], as exemplified by the [60(!!!) years it took for a major nautical navigation system breakthrough to get accepted](John Harrison (an outsider to the field of astronomy) invented a new mechanical method to measuring longitude at sea in 1710. This method was different from the dominant astronomical approach. It took ~60 years for this innovation to be accepted by the board of longitude in 1770 (the core of the field), because he had to pass through barriers of legitimacy, including initial resistance from the astronomers and politicians (despite initial positive reception from the navy). This internal resistance was eventually overcome by external actors intervening, such as the royal society (which influenced the astronomers), and the monarchy (which influenced the politicians).)
