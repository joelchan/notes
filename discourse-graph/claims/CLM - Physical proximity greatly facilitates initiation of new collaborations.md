- Additional indirect evidence comes from the literature on collocation and collaboration, which so far we can see generally seems to find facilitative effects on knowledge transfer and collaboration from induced face-to-face contact [[[[CLM]] - Physical proximity greatly facilitates initiation of new collaborations]]

    - An entry point is [[@cataliniMicrogeographyDirectionInventive2017]], who found substantial changes in the likelihood of collaboration [across research labs](setting: major research university in France) as a function of [collocation](((5o6r4gVo9))), particularly for labs that were "[further apart](((WduBJ9Zfy)))" in research areas.

        - This work *suggests* / is consistent with the idea that other channels of search across boundaries are less efficient than face-to-face (presumably "small touch", bc collocation) contact with people from other units (i.e., across boundaries). the logic is that if the [search costs]([[search costs of innovation]]) were the same / comparable, then those ideas would have initiation probability that is similar to collocation, in the absence of collocation.

    - Similarly, [[@boudreauFieldExperimentSearch2017]] found that The likelihood that any given pair of [scientists](((ni7gqlsHZ))) who were [assigned](((3EdxejW1j))) to the [same breakout room](((c_73yT22R))) to discuss their work would collaborate on a [pilot grant proposal](((luxOWrHJ_))) was [estimated](((J6rkdI6pn))) to be substantially (~75%) [higher](((gA4onRafb))) ($$p(collaborate) ~= .28$$) compared to scientist pairs who were assigned to different rooms ($$p(collaborate) ~= .16$$). This estimated effect was statistically significant at p < .10.

        - Note, however: this effect seems to be driven by [facilitating scientist pairs who are from the same clinical area to collaborate](The [estimated increased likelihood of collaboration](((WqhZS9HHR))) from being randomly assigned to be in the same breakout room dropped to basically zero when they added an interaction term between being in the same room and whether pairs of scientists were from the same clinical area; this interaction term was [statistically significant](((jvGl0gqAS))) at p < .10), which suggests there might still be [important inefficiencies](((J4R-1bnk-))) to accessing and using cross-boundary knowledge, even when you get initial access to it through a person.
