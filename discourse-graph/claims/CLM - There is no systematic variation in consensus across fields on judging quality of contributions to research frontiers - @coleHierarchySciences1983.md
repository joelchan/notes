- Cole et al basically argue that things are very fuzzy at the frontiers, and the differences, if any exist, are small, much smaller relative to differences at the core.

- core of first half of paper is review of a bunch of prior studies, which basically provide no/negative evidence that there's systematic variation in consensus across fields that are thought to be at different levels of the [[hierarchy of the sciences]]: [[[[CLM]] - There is no systematic variation in consensus across fields on judging quality of contributions to research frontiers - [[@coleHierarchySciences1983]]]]

    - see Zuckerman and Merton idea of codification

        - they come right out and say that legibility/consensus is a potential indicator of degree of codification

        - lower rejection rates as a proxy. huh. that's... not clean.

            - cc [[[[QUE]] - How can we measure quality legibility of a field?]]

    - rubin 1975 - chemists blame themselves, sociologists dispute validity of criteria - proxy for paradigm development and consensus?

    - hargens 1975 idea of normative integration (maps to cognitive consensus here) - political science < chemistry and math

    - cole 1979 -

        - no significant differences in relationship between citations and full professor promotion decisions

        - no significant differences in high citation performers x age (no more young high performers in "high consensus" fields)

            - this makes me think of [[@jonesAgeGreatInvention2010]] - IIRC they had different results? or maybe it was just increasing over time, but no big differences across fields? or maybe it was one of [[Dean Simonton]]'s papers?

        - note, though: i think the hierarchy was taken as given, not measured directly.

    - cole, cole and dietrich 1978 -

        - ask to eval peers and "greatest scientists" - small and barely statistically significant differences in expected pattern

            - this makes me think if there's any published data on IRR for peer review; taht could be proxy for legibility - maybe average time to publication? publication history? rate of "sleeping beauties"?

        - another proxy that i hate: distribution of citations (more concentration = higher consensus). i gues, like it or not, if there is high concentration, then there is high consensus in a sense. even if htat consensus is off base. here they used [[Gini coefficient]]

            - both cc [[[[QUE]] - How can we measure quality legibility of a field?]]

    - pilot study in this paper: does citation obsolescence vary across english lit vs. science?

        - control for growth rate of field (number of pubs), which Zuckerman and Merton and Price do not

    - cole and cole 1980; cole and cole 1981; cole, rubin and cole 1978 - no evidence of systematic variation across fields in terms of IRR (roughly) for grant peer review

    - small 1975 - weak correlation between reviewer IRR and eventual citation rate

    - carter 1974 - NIH peer review, week correlation between priority scores and later citations of work (r = .40; hmmm actually not that weak; real signal, seems like, but far from perfectly predictive)

    - cole and cole 1973 -

        - similar to [[@morganPrestigeDrivesEpistemic2018]] - if equal quant / citations, person from higher prestige institution rated more highly than person from lower prestige institution

            - cc [[[[CLM]] - Prestige substantially controls how scientific ideas spread]]

    - these are the ones to dig into that have the actual evidence #[[âž° breadcrumbs]]
