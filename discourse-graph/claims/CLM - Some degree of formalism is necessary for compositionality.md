        - [[Joel Chan]] #TaskWrite explain why formalism is necessary for compositionality

    - Description

        - Consider some effective #example-of [[synthesis]] representations:

                [[Robert Horn]]'s ideas about [[Visual Language]] - as a way to compress a paper, but also representations for [[compositionality]]

        - It's important to notice something about examples of synthesis representations: they go quite a bit further than simply grouping or associating things (thought that is an important start). They have some kind of **formal semantic structure** that specifies what entities exist, and what kinds of relations exist between the entities. #formality

        - This formal structure isn't just for show: it's what enables the kind of synthesis that really powers significant knowledge work! Formal structures unlock powerful forms of reasoning like conceptual combination, analogy, and causal reasoning. This is a key part of the vision of projects like the [[Semantic Web]].

        - Judea Pearl puts this quite emphatically, sketching out a "[[Ladder of Causation]]" that puts mere associationist reasoning at the bottom, and sophisticated counterfactual causal reasoning at the top, which requires a rich causal model (one kind of formal structure).

        - Basically, need to know what the entities are, and how they can be connected. Need some kind of "calculus", even if it's ad-hoc.

        - I want to emphasize the point here about "some degree": it's probably not necessary to have very complex basic units, since #[[[[CL]] - Complex compositionality can arise from surprisingly simple units and connection dynamics]]

        - Also, "harder" formalisms like [[ontologies]] may be inappropriate because [[[[CLM]] - Ideas develop simultaneously at multiple timescales, levels of granularity, and completeness]], which conflicts with the ontology requirement that things be (ultimately?) uniquely identifiable.
