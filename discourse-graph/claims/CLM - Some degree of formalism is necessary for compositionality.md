    - Description

        - Consider some effective #example-of [[synthesis]]

        - It's important to notice something about examples of synthesis representations: they go quite a bit further than simply grouping or associating things (thought that is an important start). They have some kind of **formal semantic structure** that specifies what entities exist, and what kinds of relations exist between the entities. #formality

        - This formal structure isn't just for show: it's what enables the kind of synthesis that really powers significant knowledge work! Formal structures unlock powerful forms of reasoning like conceptual combination, analogy, and causal reasoning. This is a key part of the vision of projects like the [[Semantic Web]]

        - Judea Pearl puts this quite emphatically, sketching out a "[[Ladder of Causation]]

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FVzg2_Z68_g?alt=media&token=444b3753-081c-4fa3-a689-f2861a8fba7a)

        - Basically, need to know what the entities are, and how they can be connected. Need some kind of "calculus", even if it's ad-hoc.

        - I want to emphasize the point here about "some degree": it's probably not necessary to have very complex basic units, since [[CL - Complex compositionality can arise from surprisingly simple units and connection dynamics]]

        - Also, "harder" formalisms like [[ontologies]]
