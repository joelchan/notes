    - Description:

        - We used to think that far is best [[@wardAnalogicalDistancePurpose1998]]

        - [[@dunbarHowScientistsThink1997]]

            - super far (nonbiological) analogies mostly were used for explanations, and were super rare

            - in contrast, other organism analogies disproportionately powered hypothesis ideation (20 vs. 3), and to a lesser extent, experiment design discussions (12 to 9), compared to within-organism analogies
