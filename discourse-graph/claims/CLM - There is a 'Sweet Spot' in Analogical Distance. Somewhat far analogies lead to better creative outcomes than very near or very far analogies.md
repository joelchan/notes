    - Description:

        - We used to think that far is best [[@wardAnalogicalDistancePurpose1998]]

        - [[@dunbarHowScientistsThink1997]] shows that, maybe in science specifically, somewhat far is best

            - super far (nonbiological) analogies mostly were used for explanations, and were super rare

            - in contrast, other organism analogies disproportionately powered hypothesis ideation (20 vs. 3), and to a lesser extent, experiment design discussions (12 to 9), compared to within-organism analogies

- This is really useful to think about with [[Matt Clancy]]: if there really is some kind of ["sweet spot"]([[[[CLM]] - There is a 'Sweet Spot' in Analogical Distance. Somewhat far analogies lead to better creative outcomes than very near or very far analogies]]) of analogical distance, it is actually possible that "near citations" are... more performative (or social / framing / narrative) than causal for the innovation itself

    - see, e.g., [[@cattaniInnovatorsActsFraming2020]]

        - what's interesting too is that there might be a tension in the other direction as well: under some conditions, it may be more advantageous to "dress up" your explanations of your innovation with far (perhaps more familiar?) analogies than were actually used to generate your idea (see [[@sanerAnalogiesOutBlue1999]])

Somewhat far analogies lead to better creative outcomes than very near or very far analogies]] feels like it could be a major theoretical contribution??? beyond near vs. far (we've mostly though about surface similarity), but this one refines it to say, have some relational similarity, and also make sure there is the right balance of [[Z: Alignable differences]] (some of the core attributes need to be the same, but also good if some are different!) --> new theoretically motivated metric

    - remember that [[Kevin Dunbar]] is AT UMD! Should talk to him about this

        - it depends critical on his hard-won insights
