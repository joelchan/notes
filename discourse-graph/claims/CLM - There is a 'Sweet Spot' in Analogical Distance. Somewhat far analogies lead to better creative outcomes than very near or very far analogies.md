    - Description:

        - We used to think that far is best [[@wardAnalogicalDistancePurpose1998]]

        - [[@dunbarHowScientistsThink1997]] shows that, maybe in science specifically, somewhat far is best

            - super far (nonbiological) analogies mostly were used for explanations, and were super rare

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FPrLf45BISk.png?alt=media&token=3325f60f-f449-4c35-bbdc-41d15f367e58)

            - in contrast, other organism analogies disproportionately powered hypothesis ideation (20 vs. 3), and to a lesser extent, experiment design discussions (12 to 9), compared to within-organism analogies

    - R-Sources:

        - People generated more novel ideas with remotely related (not unrelated) stimuli #unsourced [[@wang2019wikipedia]]

        - #Claim Somewhat-far analogies strike the best balance between novelty and quality [[@fuMeaningFarImpact2013]]

        - [[@chanBestDesignIdeas2015]]

        - [[@gentnerStructureMappingAnalogy1997]]

        - #[[observation-notes]] Crowd workers generated the most novel and practical ideas when given analogical inspirations found from [domain-independent, concrete constraint problem descriptions](((M8KfyPUsY))), compared to inspirations from [domain-independent abstract constraints](((TUj6U8Fv9))), [domain-dependent concrete constraints](((Aw21pCePA))), or [domain-dependent abstract constraints](((r6_rbDIRA))) (which were about equal) [[@yuDistributedAnalogicalIdea2016]]
