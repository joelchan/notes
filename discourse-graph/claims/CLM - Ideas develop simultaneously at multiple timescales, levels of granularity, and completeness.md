    - Description

        - Idea of [[QUE - How can we best bridge private vs. public knowledge]]

        - Also relevant is [[Ricardo Sosa]]

        - This is another hidden reason why [[PTN - incremental formalization]]

        - The brain actually is doing a LOT of the work! The external spaces are part of the system, but the data model encompasses more than the scratches on paper or on the whiteboard. We can gain insight into this by noticing how things cluster or repeat over time across different media, both in the head and in the world.

        - Might be a reason that [[CLM - Multiplicity is necessary for synthesis]]

        - See also: [[CLM - People process complex information in multiple levels and stages of processing]]

        - I would say this also is a foundational reason that [[CLM - The notion of an 'idea' is very complicated]]
