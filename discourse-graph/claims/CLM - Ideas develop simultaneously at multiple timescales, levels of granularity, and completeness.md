    - Description

        - Idea of [[[[QUE]] - How can we best bridge private vs. public knowledge?]] is described very well here, and one of the central tensions of explaining the development of Darwin's idea of man [[@gruberDarwinManPsychological1974]]

        - Also relevant is [[Ricardo Sosa]] makes this point in his [[[[THE]] - Accretion theory of ideation]] [[@sosaAccretionTheoryIdeation2019]]

        - This is another hidden reason why [[[[PTN]] - incremental formalization]] is powerful for creative [[synthesis]] in particular, and may not become as important for, say, a [[systematic review]] or [[m/meta-analysis]]: need to bridge and connect the multiple overlapping layers of ideas.

        - The brain actually is doing a LOT of the work! The external spaces are part of the system, but the data model encompasses more than the scratches on paper or on the whiteboard. We can gain insight into this by noticing how things cluster or repeat over time across different media, both in the head and in the world.

        - Might be a reason that [[[[CL]] - Multiplicity is necessary for synthesis]]

        - See also: [[[[CL]] - People process complex information in multiple levels and stages of processing]]

        - I would say this also is a foundational reason that [[[[CLM]] - The notion of an 'idea' is very complicated]]
