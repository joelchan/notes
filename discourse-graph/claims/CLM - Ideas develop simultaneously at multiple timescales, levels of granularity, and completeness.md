    - Description

        - Idea of [[[[QUE]] - How can we best bridge private vs. public knowledge?]] is described very well here, and one of the central tensions of explaining the development of Darwin's idea of man [[@gruberDarwinManPsychological1974]]

        - Also relevant is [[Ricardo Sosa]] makes this point in his [[[[THE]] - Accretion theory of ideation]] [[@sosaAccretionTheoryIdeation2019]]

        - This is another hidden reason why [[[[PTN]] - incremental formalization]] is powerful for creative [[synthesis]] in particular, and may not become as important for, say, a [[systematic review]] or [[m/meta-analysis]]: need to bridge and connect the multiple overlapping layers of ideas.

        - The brain actually is doing a LOT of the work! The external spaces are part of the system, but the data model encompasses more than the scratches on paper or on the whiteboard. We can gain insight into this by noticing how things cluster or repeat over time across different media, both in the head and in the world.

        - Might be a reason that [[[[CL]] - Multiplicity is necessary for synthesis]]

        - See also: [[[[CL]] - People process complex information in multiple levels and stages of processing]]

        - I would say this also is a foundational reason that [[[[CLM]] - The notion of an 'idea' is very complicated]]

- Reflecting again on convo with [[Sue Borchardt]] about [[[[CLM]] - Ideas develop simultaneously at multiple timescales, levels of granularity, and completeness]], and the core idea of a [[dialectic]]

    - The reason that [[[[PTN]] - representational talkback]] is so powerful is the seamless, fluid moving back and forth between the modalities of thought and representational regimes. It's about the seams in a way, but that doesn't seem quite right. There is a metaphor here about the "**one-wayness**" of the interaction that feels like it's at the heart of the conflict on the interaction design side. For example, exporting as a metaphor, not just an action, seems fundamentally limiting.

    - [[sys/RoamResearch]] does allow for a [[dialectic]] between the formal and the informal, smoothly deploying various mechanisms of [[[[PTN]] - incremental formalization]] to fluidly move between them, from daily notes to zettels, post-hoc block creation and references, unlinked references and so on.

        - but it's, as I wrote previously, and discussed with [[Sue Borchardt]], [seriously limited on the dialectic between the verbal and the nonverbal](A serious limitation of [[sys/RoamResearch]] is the friction of moving to nonverbal / visual modalities of exploration. While [[[[CL]] - Visual thinking interfaces are tricky to get right]], most serious work probably has to move between verbal and nonverbal (less propositional?) modalities of representation: the holy grail is being able to move between the two (incidentally this is what [[sys/Liquid:Author]] can do, and is anticipated by the idea of [[[[PTN]] - representational talkback]] introduced in [[@yamamotoRepresentationalTalkbackApproach1998]]), and strongly related to this idea of [[Reflective Conversation with the Design Material]] and [co-evolution of design and problem space]( [[[[CLM]] - Design proceeds by co-evolution of problem and solution space]]))

    - It's important to ask: are our interaction metaphors up to the task of supporting this kind of [[dialectic]]? If so, what explains the lack of such systems in regular use?

        - OTOH we [[[[CLM]] - Effective individual synthesis systems (seem to mostly) exist (for a select few)]]

    - I want my ideas to [creak and complain and shine and get excited]([[Reflective Conversation with the Design Material]]) when I try to do various things to / with it. Maybe the idea slips or sinks, or fades, or gets excited when it's close to other ideas with rich interconnections, or complains when it gets stretched too far, or muddies the writing when it comes in. --> #idea

        - What kind of medium could this work in? Could do some creative things with [[AR]] maybe?

        - What "data structures" are necessary for these interactions to be possible? Could a fully fleshed out [[std/Micropublication]] with rich context be expressive enough for this?
[[August 12th, 2020]]

- Another goes back to the idea of how we can best evaluate interventions into the creative process, knowing that it is a complex dynamical system that is constantly in flux. ((need to refactor this high-level zettelkasten: [[[[CLM]] - Ideas develop simultaneously at multiple timescales, levels of granularity, and completeness]]) A myopic focus on "did it give me something right now that I can recognize as immediately useful" is very dangerous.

    - Related to this, need to flesh out the [[[[CLM]] - Inspiration favors the prepared mind]] zettel

    - [[@sosaAccretionTheoryIdeation2019]] and [[@chanImportanceIterationCreative2015]] too

        - build on this lit note:

            - If Gruber means transitional in the sense of "ideas that turned out to be "incorrect" when the final theory was formed, but were nonetheless important ideas in the **development** of the theory", then possible shades of [[@sosaAccretionTheoryIdeation2019]] here, and also what we've been thinking about in terms of the often non-obvious and downstream value of [[analogy]] and [[ðŸ§± conceptual combination]]: not always leading to a directly valuable idea, but opening up a space (e.g., [[@chanImportanceIterationCreative2015]])

            - and this one about [[by-productive thinking]]: A few main examples of these

                - [[Darwin's theory of coral formation]]

                    - p. 101-102 --> struggle, branching

                    - p. 111-112

                - [[Darwin's monad theory of evolution]]

                    - discarded quite quickly, but gave the image of the [[irregularly branching tree of nature]], which was super important in his thought, including fueling his rejection of key implicit assumptions of contemporary theories about symmetry in the structure of species (cf. e.g., [[Quinarian system of classification]], p. 112)

                - search for causes of variation, including concept of [[hybridization]] (p. 103-106)

                    - crucial preparation for recognizing significance of [[Malthus]] and the analogy between artifical selection and natural selection

                        - led him down a "rabbit hole" of literature and field work on breeding

    - very deep implications for [[D/Computational Analogy]] (lots of these themes being exposed by what we've been doing with [[Hyeonsu]]'s stuff) as well as [[D/Solution-Diversity]] (we care about final solution quality, but often the most relevant immediate impacts of diversity are on learning)

        - see also [[[[CLM]] - A significant proportion of the benefits of analogical stimuli is oblique or indirect]]
[[May 2nd, 2020]]

- There's something developing along hte lines of this [[[[QUE]] - How can we best bridge private vs. public knowledge?]] thread. Do I have a zettel on this? Make one. [[[[CLM]] - Ideas develop simultaneously at multiple timescales, levels of granularity, and completeness]] - lots of thoughts sparked by reading [[@gruberDarwinManPsychological1974]]

    - Also wondering about [[Andy Matuschak]]'s point about how [the most effective readers and thinkers he knows don't take notes when reading](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6GNVv6RyFDewy11ZgXzce8agWxSLwJ6Ub5Rw)

        - Is the example of Darwin, and Feynman, and so on a counterexample? No, i think Andy is making a more specific point than "most effective thinkers aren't doing a systematic thing with their "notes": he acknowledges that [effective thinkers think with a notebook](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5WDNZizsbAzE1p2BLwr339fV4TCpzNvaztP2), and cites Feyman as a canonical example

- There is an overarching theme of the dance between the general and the specific, between [[decontextualization]] and [[recontextualization]], between theory and data/experiment. I think I have written about this as [[[[CLM]] - Ideas develop simultaneously at multiple timescales, levels of granularity, and completeness]]

    - #quotes "The thinker's painstaking attention to the details of one idea may seem like mere fussiness in a short view; it gains in significance as we understand its relationship with other ideas, possible for us only if we take the longer view. On the other hand, taking only the long view is like sketching with a broad brush. Too much detail is lost, and in seeing the specific relationship between detail and the general composition of ideas lies our chance to grasp the individuality of the creative person" (p. 98)

        - Here I think Gruber is talking specifically about how this plays out in our ability to develop a theory of the creative person.

    - Gruber talks about "Darwin's double task", of laying out the theory of evolution (first half of [[Origin of species]]) and then the empirical evidence in favor of the theory (and addressing empirical objections; second half of [[Origin of species]] (p. 107)

        - The way Gruber writes about this [[dance between the theoretical and the evidential]] is beautiful and worth quoting in its entirety

            - #quotes

                - > The construction of the theory and the marshaling of the evidence entailed somewhat different activities on Darwin's part.

                - > Theory construction is a matter of rumination and schematization; it is primarily an internal effort, involving play with ideas---information and generalizations---already incorporated in existing schemes of thought; its end product is the alteration of those schemes.

                - > The marshaling of evidence and the construction of general laws from particular facts is largely a matter of observation and data collection, the noting of similarities among events, and the drawing of general conclusions. But this marshaling of evidence is not simply "induction" if that term means a theoretically neutral activity or an activity preceding the construction of a theory. The whole point is that information can __only__ be incorporated in existing schemes of thought. When we notice the similarity between events or processes that seem superficially different, we are guided by a point of view that makes some characteristics important, certain comparisons possible and meaningful. This is what Hanson meant when he wrote, "Observation is a theory-laden undertaking."

                - > The two kinds of task, theoretical and evidential, entail different activities, and in the long run they may yield distinguishable products for our consideration. But __in vivo__, in the life of the thinking person, they are thoroughly intertwined. The most speculative "castle in the air" is triggered by a simple observation or a friend's remark about his dog. Hard work amassing the facts on a special point is guided by a long theoretical argument with which it may have only a tenuous logical relationship: the theory does not absolutely depend on the facts, nor could the facts ever guarantee the theory. The relation of theory and evidence is not simply logical but psychological.

            - This quote really brings to light the delicate [[dialectic]] between [[decontextualization]] (the [theory construction task](> Theory construction is a matter of rumination and schematization; it is primarily an internal effort, involving play with ideas---information and generalizations---already incorporated in existing schemes of thought; its end product is the alteration of those schemes.)) and [[recontextualization]] (the [evidence marshaling task](((HdqVA8ocv)))) , between [[compression]] and [[context]], between the general and the specific.

        - A specific #example-of this [dance]([[dance between the theoretical and the evidential]]) is the significance of the seed germination experiments, which seem trivial on their own, but gain in significance when considering the hypothesis of a single origin for new species through dissemination
