    - Description

        - Many creative thinkers are extremely effective with analog media, in the past (like [[Darwin's notebooks]]

        - Often the medium is as simple as a [[commonplace notebook]]

        - Why? Maybe one reason is that [[CLM - Visuospatial reasoning is particularly well-suited for developing early-stage knowledge structures]]

        - Analog media are also still currently eminently more *embodied* - see [[Bret Victor]]

            - > But at debilitating cost. These representations, having been invented for static media such as paper, tap into a small subset of human capabilities and neglect the rest. Knowledge work means sitting at a desk, interpreting and manipulating symbols. The human body is reduced to an eye staring at tiny rectangles and fingers on a pen or keyboard.
