    - Description

        - Many creative thinkers are extremely effective with analog media, in the past (like [[Darwin's notebooks]], [[Richard Feynman]], [[Leonardo Da Vinci]] [[@gussVinciFlyingMachines2021]], and others) and in the present.

        - Often the medium is as simple as a [[commonplace notebook]], though there might be some surprising sophistication in the practices; for example, [[[[EVD]] - Almost half of the pages in Darwin's notebooks were excised - [[@herbertRedNotebookCharles1980]]]].

        - Why? Maybe one reason is that [[[[CLM]] - Visuospatial reasoning is particularly well-suited for developing early-stage knowledge structures]] and [[[[CLM]] - Visual thinking interfaces are tricky to get right]]

        - Analog media are also still currently eminently more *embodied* - see [[Bret Victor]]'s rant about how our predominant interaction paradigms fall far short of engaging the full richness of interaction with our HANDS (and bodies) [[@victorHumaneRepresentationThought2014]]

            - > But at debilitating cost. These representations, having been invented for static media such as paper, tap into a small subset of human capabilities and neglect the rest. Knowledge work means sitting at a desk, interpreting and manipulating symbols. The human body is reduced to an eye staring at tiny rectangles and fingers on a pen or keyboard.
