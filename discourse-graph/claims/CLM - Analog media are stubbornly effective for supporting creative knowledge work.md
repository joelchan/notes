    - Description

        - Many creative thinkers are extremely effective with analog media, in the past (like [[Darwin's notebooks]], [[Richard Feynman]], [[Leonardo Da Vinci]] [[@gussVinciFlyingMachines2021]], and others) and in the present.

        - Often the medium is as simple as a [[commonplace notebook]], though there might be some surprising sophistication in the practices; for example, [[[[EVD]] - Almost half of the pages in Darwin's notebooks were excised - [[@herbertRedNotebookCharles1980]]]].

        - Why? Maybe one reason is that [[[[CL]] - Visuospatial reasoning is particularly well-suited for developing early-stage knowledge structures]] and [[[[CL]] - Visual thinking interfaces are tricky to get right]]

        - Analog media are also still currently eminently more *embodied* - see [[Bret Victor]]'s rant about how our predominant interaction paradigms fall far short of engaging the full richness of interaction with our HANDS (and bodies) [[@victorHumaneRepresentationThought2014]]

            - > But at debilitating cost. These representations, having been invented for static media such as paper, tap into a small subset of human capabilities and neglect the rest. Knowledge work means sitting at a desk, interpreting and manipulating symbols. The human body is reduced to an eye staring at tiny rectangles and fingers on a pen or keyboard.

- cf. this comment from [[Sue Borchardt]] which sums it up quite well, and also connects to [[[[CLM]] - Analog media are stubbornly effective for supporting creative knowledge work]]

    - What seems to be missing are tools for doing the kinds of sense-making, theme finding, cluster revealing, cluster finding of ideas that have been pulled together. THIS IS VISUAL SPATIAL WORK. The linearity of roam is sufficient for the other phases of work, but not this one (at least for me. I need to be able to move things around and free mix images and text and to be able to draw/write in real time). This phase also generates new insights about connections and clusters that need to be fed back into the graph. Could this be addressed with custom visualization tools using a roam API?

- Inspired by [this thread](https://twitter.com/brillhart/status/1296104103395778561) (about a different topic, but wonderful #example-of [[[[CLM]] - Analog media are stubbornly effective for supporting creative knowledge work]] highly effective thinking on paper, freely mixing text, lists, sketches, fragmentary diagrams). Really reminds me of [[Darwin's notebooks]], and [[Multiplicity]] (in the modality sense

    - A serious limitation of [[sys/RoamResearch]] is the friction of moving to nonverbal / visual modalities of exploration. While [[[[CL]] - Visual thinking interfaces are tricky to get right]], most serious work probably has to move between verbal and nonverbal (less propositional?) modalities of representation: the holy grail is being able to move between the two (incidentally this is what [[sys/Liquid:Author]] can do, and is anticipated by the idea of [[[[PTN]] - representational talkback]] introduced in [[@yamamotoRepresentationalTalkbackApproach1998]]), and strongly related to this idea of [[Reflective Conversation with the Design Material]] and [co-evolution of design and problem space]( [[[[CLM]] - Design proceeds by co-evolution of problem and solution space]])

        - [[sys/RoamResearch]] does have some workarounds, like being able to paste in screenshots of sketches, and specifying diagrams (e.g., via [[sys/Mermaid diagrams]]) or tables from text, but the moving between isn't as fluid as I'd like, and the messy sketches in particular feel "inert" and unable to interact on equal terms with the rest of the content (e.g., can't add pages post-hoc, block ref, etc.)

            - maybe some kind of interaction overlay on top of pasted in screenshots could do the trick? or in-built "layers" (not very unlike layers in photoshop and most image editing software, and how on paper you only really have soft "mutability" via layering on top, and some with erasing)

        - Beyond the cognitive consequences of this interaction / modality limitation, the highly textual and nonvisual nature of this interface can be an unnecessary turnoff for many users who like visual interfaces

- Inspired by this tweet by [[Iian Neill]] to revisit [[[[CLM]] - Analog media are stubbornly effective for supporting creative knowledge work]]

    - And this really kind of circles back to the q we're wrestling with on the

    - There is something about the "slow vs. fast" framing that doesn't sit well with me re: [[[[CL]] - Science is getting less bang for its buck]]

        - I think the issue isn't just the speed... i mean it's related to it

        - but the arduousness of the task makes it less likely for people to stick at something well over time, as long as it takes to really get to the real deep insights that [take a long time to come to fruition]([[[[CLM]] - True creative breakthroughs often take a long time to develop]])... this accumulative process. there is pressure to "get it right" in one go, one and done... instead of the slow, [[[[CLM]] - Ideas develop simultaneously at multiple timescales, levels of granularity, and completeness]], the opposite of [[short-termism]]
[[October 25th, 2021]]

- Lots of thoughts about [[[[CLM]] - Where possible, design systems, not tools]] and [[[[CLM]] - Analog media are stubbornly effective for supporting creative knowledge work]]

    - [[Cedric Chin]] exemplifies an elaborate nontraditional system, where he skips straight to the publishing part of the [[Digital Garden]] workflow, in his blog

    - This makes me remember how many faculty I've seen seem to use their collaborators *and their grants/manuscripts* as access points for their memory

        - It's not optimal, but it might be pretty close, and sure as hell is optimal from the standpoint of minimizing distance between their "process" and their "output" (their process space is literally their output space)

            - Wondering if the costs are more long-term: harder to remix ideas, calcification....?

    - The other thought this sparks is a connection back to [[@luttersIdentifyingExpertiseMarkers2004]] [[micronotes]] and [[@bernsteinInformationScrapsHow2008]] information scraps (from [[Max Van Kleek]])

        - The **opportunity cost** of having a formalism that excludes really really important elements, is too high to adopt for creative knowledge work

            - This is a subset or specific instantiation of the general [[[[CLM]] - (premature) formalism considered harmful]]

            - In this case, a formalism that excludes speculation, for example, or rough scraps that we don't know what to do with yet, will prematurely kill the creative process

                - cc [[@sosaAccretionTheoryIdeation2019]]'s notion of [[ideasimals]]

                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FtylSnkBRWv?alt=media&token=a9e87c17-5bee-4c99-a515-aeb10cd234e5)

                - Really hitting the theme of how important it is to have the informal live alongside the formal: asked about [[abduction]], and where that lives in here - my sense is that [[[[PTN]] - discourse graph]] don't represent abduction, but support it (by having something to talk back to); similar to [[Chinmay Kulkarni]]'s question about speculation

                - {{embed: Another goes back to the idea of how we can best evaluate interventions into the creative process, knowing that it is a complex dynamical system that is constantly in flux. ((need to refactor this high-level zettelkasten: [[[[CLM]] - Ideas develop simultaneously at multiple timescales, levels of granularity, and completeness]]) A myopic focus on "did it give me something right now that I can recognize as immediately useful" is very dangerous.}}

            - [[@ackermanIntellectualChallengeCSCW2000]] throughout this piece i am mentally translating "social activity" for "sensemaking" or "creative knowledge work" or "synthesis" - e.g., "{social activity | synthesis work} is fluid and nuanced, and this makes systems technically difficult to construct properly and often awkward to use" (p. 181)

        - Designers talked about gaining "a big pile of tools" from their experiences in multiple industries, and ^^how they collected many of them^^, when possible. One even described his "magic box of neat stuff" that stored all sorts of little interesting technologies like nitinol, velcro, high-strength alloys, etc., that he had acquired in his past projects and hoped to be able to use later.

            - Also talked about ^^going wide before going deep^^

                - probably to prevent [[design fixation]]
