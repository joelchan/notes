- this result seems to imply the opposite of Mark's [intuition for optimizers](so [[Mark Fuge]]'s intuition is that on the global/exploration end, diversity of initial samples should have limited marginal gain over existing propensity to explore): **[[[[CLM]] - people with lower propensity or capacity to explore benefit *less* from diverse information during ideation]]!**

    - it's like a gradient descent algorithm that basically ignores its initialization and jumps right back into local search.

    - is there potential theory behind this?

        - I'm also thinking along similar lines of the claim from [[Thomas Kuhn]] that [people within a paradigm are less open to novelty]([[Thomas Kuhn]] has the idea of a paradigm and "normal science". But according to Crotty's reading of Kuhn in Ch. 2, the presence of a paradigm is actually associated with *lower* tolerance for novelty!). Here, the mechanism feels more __affective__ in nature, like [[motivated reasoning]] or [[confirmation bias]]

        - i'm thinking of the general mechanism of [[[[THE]] - Opportunistic Assimilation Theory]] from [[[[CLM]] - Inspiration favors the prepared mind]], but it's not quite the same. a key difference is that in the classic OA case, the preparation comes from failure, from the [[Zeigarnik effect]], basically. The mechanism feels __cognitive__ in nature.

    - this could have significant implications for creativity support if it's true! it could be that we need to design much more carefully for what comes __before__ inspirational stimuli, to prime the pump, otherwise we get null effects.

            - note: here the comparison is to nothing, not low diversity

    - IDEO's engineers keep "a mix of new technology coming in from the customer side" by ^^actively searching^^ for the potentially valuable technologies of new industry

    - also ties in with IDEO's intentional organizational practices to create an environment conducive to innovation

        - [[[[EVD]] - IDEO intentionally cultivated social norms of help-seeking and help-giving across disciplinary and project boundaries to maintain analogical flows of knowledge, using mechanisms such as peer reputation for performance evaluations - [[@hargadonTechnologyBrokeringInnovation1997]]]]

        - [[[[EVD]] - Intentional organizational routines, both formal and informal, such as brainstorming and regular meetings, emails, informal conversations, served as main sites of analogical retrieval and circulation of technical knowledge at IDEO - [[@hargadonTechnologyBrokeringInnovation1997]]]]

    - questions

        - **Is the lack of propensity for exploration amongst individuals related to a lack of exposure or understanding of the diverse perspectives behind the information they are exposed to?**

            - In other words, Does the provision of more context aid in exploration?

                - While passion and curiosity are definitely factors that impact one's tendency to explore new ideas, what motivates people to trust the information they are provided in the first place? What about conflicting beliefs and perspectives? How do they impact one's propensity toward exploring ideas?

            - If it is so, then how can those be implemented? What could be the right way to approach this?

                - could be analogically tied to [[explainable AI]] or maybe provide insights into means of implementation

    - similar to [[[[CLM]] - People are more likely to benefit from analogies if they encounter/process them with an active goal or license to use them for inspiration]]
