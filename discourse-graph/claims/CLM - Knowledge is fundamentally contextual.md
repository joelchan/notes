    - Description

        - Probably varies though: [[[[CLM]] - Information needs can vary on a general-to-contextual dimension]]

        - Related to [[tacit knowledge]]

    - R-Sources

        - [[standpoint theory]]

            - I'm now wanting to write about the idea of feminist [[standpoint theory]] (h/t [[Amanda Lazar]]) which came up in conversation with [[Tim Gorichanaz]]:

            - The stronger version of this is potentially [[standpoint theory]]. Amanda recommends [[@bardzellFeministHCITaking2010a]] as a canonical ref for feminist HCI; it's not the original source for standpoint theory, though.

        - There is a fundamental idea that the project of creating a human-wide knowledge base (a la [[Semantic Web]]) must fail, because [[[[CLM]] - Knowledge is fundamentally contextual]]

        - [[@bowkerAllKnowledgeLocal2010]] Title: All knowledge is local

        - [[@harawaySituatedKnowledgesScience1988]]'s idea of [[situated knowledges]], following from [[feminist critique of the god's eye view]]

            - really great summary of what [[@harawaySituatedKnowledgesScience1988]] says about how [[context]] really really matters (and what that means) when evaluating and interpreting knowledge claims [[@harrisonMakingEpistemologicalTrouble2011]]
