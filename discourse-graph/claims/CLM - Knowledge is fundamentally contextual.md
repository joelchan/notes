    - Description

        - Probably varies though: [[[[CLM]] - Information needs can vary on a general-to-contextual dimension]]

        - Related to [[tacit knowledge]]

    - R-Sources

        - [[standpoint theory]]

            - I'm now wanting to write about the idea of feminist [[standpoint theory]] (h/t [[Amanda Lazar]]) which came up in conversation with [[Tim Gorichanaz]]:

            - The stronger version of this is potentially [[standpoint theory]]. Amanda recommends [[@bardzellFeministHCITaking2010a]] as a canonical ref for feminist HCI; it's not the original source for standpoint theory, though.

        - There is a fundamental idea that the project of creating a human-wide knowledge base (a la [[Semantic Web]]) must fail, because [[[[CLM]] - Knowledge is fundamentally contextual]]

- We're not as certain about conceptual models for other elements of [[context]]: more about the conditions under which the evidence was produced; not just the "method", but the "setting"?  aka how can we model claims in a way that formally respects the fact that [[[[CLM]] - Knowledge is fundamentally contextual]]?

    - But here things are quite a bit less stable. Thinking a bit of [[@shipmanFormalityConsideredHarmful1999]] now.

    - We'd love to be able to do faceting and stuff, make this more formal so the computer can help.

    - Like, we only later found out that maybe the 10yo age is important, so then we need to really understand

    - Our interest here is intensely practical: it's probably really important for scholars to be able to **record** these bits of information: where should they go? how should they be reprsented?

    - Is this even possible?

    - And once we have a model, we'd love to be able to map larger categories of "conditions under which the thing was produced" - perhaps "pre-seed" extraction of snippets of details that might turn out to be generative [[context]]!

        - cf. [[context queries]], especially:

            - How might I ^^generalize^^ from these claims? For example, do these claims apply to my context?

            - How might I ^^explain^^ what is going on in this set of claims? For example, how might I explain contradictions or tensions amongst these ideas?

    - So this needs to be done on the go, developing over time

    - ontology is probably out

    - **how do we represent the fuller [contextual]([[context]]) nature of the claim?**

        - we have some parts of it in richer models like [[std/Micropublication]]:

            - time, maybe... but that's useless without some sense of "what was known" or other stuff

            - authorship/attribution (so we can get at stuff)

    - So we're really looking for brainstorming feedback here

    - Concrete examples:

        - The [attribute]([[[[CLM]] - Core attribute (mis)matches mediate the benefits of analogies in real-world, complex problem solving]]) stuff

        - The [[S: B6 as part of prophylactic strategy against lymphopenia]] thing, and key distinctions:

            - {{embed: Important distinctions/contexts for claims}}

        - think [[@henrichWeirdestPeopleWorld2010]], for example, or [[@wasowAgendaSeedingHow2020]]

    - We're also going to be uncovering more complexities in the process of specifying these in a formal enough way that computation can be of help, but flexibly enough that there is room for exploration and learning over time

- Most evidence is partial ([[[[CLM]] - Knowledge is fundamentally contextual]]). Claims that have a greater diversity of evidence in support of them (with similar mechanistic hypotheses) should all else equal be more credible, since the diversity of alternative hypotheses (e.g., it was a confound of X, this setting was just easier, etc.) should sort of "cancel out".

- Respect for the [contextual nature of knowledge]([[[[CLM]] - Knowledge is fundamentally contextual]])

    - We are not aiming to *replace* the role of BSO experts, or somehow extract their knowledge into a repository in a way that makes the experts obsolete. Not only is this something we don't want to do, we don't even think it is possible! The "how-to" knowledge that we know businesses desperately need, simply [cannot be extracted in this way]([[[[CLM]] - Knowledge-that and knowledge-how are best stored/communicated in distinct media]]).

- From an efficacy standpoint, also runs afoul of [[[[CLM]] - Knowledge is fundamentally contextual]], [[[[CLM]] - Universal Semantic Webs are neither feasible nor useful]], and infrastructure stuff, and sort of falls into the trap of assuming [[Conduit Metaphor]]

    - [[reuse]] feels like the wrong framing. or.. unproductive at least. something is off. there is an implicit assumption that i can literally use the component, like a circuit board piece, or a gear. but knowledge isn't like that. i don't think. cc [[[[EXP]] - [[D/Synthesis Infrastructure]] - Field study for discourse graph extension]]

    - Past thinking on this:

        - A fundamental uncertainty is whether the relatively formalized nature of [[[[PTN]] - discourse graph]] can be integrated with the open-ended, seemingly unstructured, backtrack-ridden, speculative and "half-baked" nature of thinking that underlies real synthesis (see [[@gruberDarwinManPsychological1974]] for vivid descriptions of this). Some past work on whether/how formality can be integrated into systems for supporting thinking suggests there is a real danger that imposing such formalisms may yield more harm (e.g., by cutting off speculative lines of inquiry, imposing too much overhead) than benefits in settings characterized by context-dependent, evolving requirements for formal structure, such as creative knowledge work in uncharted domains (see [[@shipmanFormalityConsideredHarmful1999]] for an excellent introduction to this). A related danger is that the kinds of knowledge that is necessary for

- if it’s more “business-related” reasons, like can’t find a large enough market, can’t go mainstream, that’s less interesting to me; but if it’s more fundamental (e.g., [[[[[[CLM]] - Knowledge is fundamentally contextual]], [[[[CLM]] - Gracefully integrating formalism into interactive systems is hard]]), then that’s more interesting and worth working on

    - nevertheless, important to keep these past “failures” in mind, since the larger vision is so dimilar

    - reminds me also of [[Benjamin Reinhardt]]’s comments about the [[sys/Memex]] as a philosophers stone in computing: cautionary note about whether it’s actually at all possible

    - could also be as simple as they weren't serious enough, as [this article](https://qz.com/480741/this-free-online-encyclopedia-has-achieved-what-wikipedia-can-only-dream-of/) on the success of the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] suggests

- 2 - One might argue that the previous issue is constrained to our current suboptimal incentive structures and human error. What if we all acted in good faith? I think we would still want separable, accessible means of tracing claims back to their evidence, because [[[[CLM]] - Knowledge is fundamentally contextual]]

    - Claims are scoped. Conditions can change. Obvious example is what is possible vs. not, why X did not work. Crucial to retain info. This is sort of inherent to any sort of knowledge claim

    - For science at the frontier of knowledge, I think there's more to it. Significance of result changes over time, need to have it be independent somehow

[[June 25th, 2020]]

- Part of this is the deep tension about the degree to which [[[[CLM]] - Knowledge is fundamentally contextual]]

    - See, e.g., Representationalist approaches appear to suggest that computational models can stand in for, even replace, domain expertise. Expertise appears as something to be extracted or automated, ‘stretching whatever discourse they find upon the ontological grid that is provided by their particular design methodology’ ([Agre, 2004](#): 8). In such a model the expert is ultimately disposable, and the specificity of the domain is something to be overcome. Contemporary manifestations of this pole include arguments such as that big data analytics or machine learning will dispense with the need for (domain) theory altogether (c.f. [Anderson, 2008](#); [Slezak, 1989](#)). In contrast, irreductionist approaches tend to take a realist stance to the heterogeneity of expertise, knowledge, or domains more broadly; in some form they tend to recognize that, say, infectious medicine may require epistemologies and methods distinct from those for, say, understanding geologists, or travel agents. Irreductionist figurations of the logic speak to a desire for approaches to heterogeneity (of knowledge, expertise, methods or data) that do not resort to overcoming difference by reducing it to a single underlying logic or decompositional heuristic.
