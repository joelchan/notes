    - Description

        - [[compression]] can be thought of as [[abstraction]]. A core thing that abstraction does is remove "extraneous" details, retaining only what is "necesssary".

        - This process of removing details is studied by [[CSCW]] in the context of Knowledge [[reuse]]: the rich history of studies here emphasize that [[decontextualization]] ---removing extraneous details from a description of a knowledge object --- is a necessary precondition for [[reuse]], across organizational/social boundaries and time [[@ackermanSharingKnowledgeExpertise2013]].

            - In [[CSCW]] theories of knowledge reuse, there is a related idea of [[decontextualization]], where a bit of knowledge has to be stripped of "irrelevant" details in order to become useful in organizational contexts across boundaries.

                - Decontextualization allows knowledge to be stored and passed across organizational boundaries, enabling coordination.

            - #[[@starInstitutionalEcologyTranslations1989]] also introduces the related idea of [[[[PTN]] - boundary object]]s

        - could be addressed if we design for the [[dance between the theoretical and the evidential]]
