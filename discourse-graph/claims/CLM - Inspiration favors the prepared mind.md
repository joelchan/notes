    - {{[[DONE]]}} We can probably put this under constraints/[other obstacles](and avoid obstacles $$Z_{1-N}$$): this is a "control variable" for us: we get people when they're ready. The idea is that even under these conditions, it can be hard to get value out of analogical stimuli

[[Notes from Joel's PhD about analogy]]

- The would-be analogizer must have a ‚Äúprepared mind‚Äù [[[[CLM]] - Inspiration favors the prepared mind]]

    - If designers or problem solvers are looking for potential analogies, (e.g., have been instructed to use analogies in problem-solving), the likelihood of successfully accessing and using a far-field analogy goes up significantly ([Gick & Holyoak, 1980]([[@gickAnalogicalProblemSolving1980]]); Casakin & Goldschmidt, 1999)

    - If designers or problem solvers have an open goal to solve the problem (e.g., they reached an impasse and are now puttering around looking for inspiration or just relief from unproductive problem solving, but still really really want to solve the problem), then the likelihood of successfully accessing and using a far-field analogy goes up significantly (Christensen & Schunn, 2005; Tseng et al, 2008) ‚Äì this fits with some work on incubation in creative problem-solving (see, e.g., Seifert et al, 1995)
