        - this made the rounds on twitter: "In a controlled experiment with two disjoint program committees, the ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM'17) found that reviewers with author information were 1.76x more likely to recommend acceptance of papers from famous authors, and 1.67x more likely to recommend acceptance of papers from top institutions.” (from [here](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/6/228027-effectiveness-of-anonymization-in-double-blind-review/fulltext#R6), referencing [this study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.00502.pdf); famous precursor to this is the peters and ceci study that showed many papers from prestigious authors/institutions didn’t make it through the next time; commentary on that [here](https://thewinnower.com/discussions/7-_the-_peters-_ceci-_study-_of-_journal-_publications
