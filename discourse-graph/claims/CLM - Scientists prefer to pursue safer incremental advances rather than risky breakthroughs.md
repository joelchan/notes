            - #Claim Scientists mostly pursue incremental advances, rarely pursuing high-risk innovation (partly because cost/risk is higher than potential reward) #short-termism

        - [[@bryanInnovationCrisisEvidence2020]]

            - huge payoffs --> MANY entrants --> race towards lower-value but easier to pull off (read: incremental) therapies being explored. #short-termism

        - [[@bhattacharyaStagnationScientificIncentives2020]]

            - Emphasis on citations as measure of scientific productivity incentivizes incremental over exploratory work #unverified #short-termism

        - [[@fortnowViewpointTimeComputer2009]]

            - Discusses (mostly from personal experience) the issues with a conference-driven publication culture, including deadline-driven, [[least-publishable unit]]
