    - Description

        - Formal structure unlocks the most sophisticated levels of synthesis we want. Unfortunately, formal structure is also **very tedious** to specify, especially in the exploratory, open-ended domains where synthesis is most valuable. It's devilishly tricky to make systems that support formalism that users will actually use (without a gun to their head).

        - Tools for synthesis that attempt to incorporate formalism typically have an extremely high barrier to entry *and* ongoing burden on the user. This overhead is exceedingly difficult to overcome for any kind of ongoing work.

        - These problems are well-documented in the classic "Formality Considered Harmful: Experiences, Emerging Themes, and Directions on the Use of Formal Representations in Interactive Systems" [[@shipmanFormalityConsideredHarmful1999]]. In brief, this paper identifies four classes of difficulties:

In brief, this paper identifies four classes of difficulties:

            1. Cognitive overhead (aka [[Cognitive Load]]): often the task of specifying formalism is extraneous to the primary task, or is just plain annoying to do

            1. [[tacit knowledge]]: if relevant info for developing formalism is tacit, asking people to formalize it will interrupt the task, with serious consequences for the quality of the work

            1. [[Enforcing Premature Structure]]: people don't want to commit until they're sure what formalism is actually useful for their task (and what's extraneous and only annoying)

            1. [[Situational Structure]]: ((LhqpJ_jeV))
