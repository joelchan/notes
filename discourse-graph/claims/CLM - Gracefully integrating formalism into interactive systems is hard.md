    - Description

        - Formal structure unlocks the most sophisticated levels of synthesis we want. Unfortunately, formal structure is also **very tedious** to specify, especially in the exploratory, open-ended domains where synthesis is most valuable. It's devilishly tricky to make systems that support formalism that users will actually use (without a gun to their head).

        - Tools for synthesis that attempt to incorporate formalism typically have an extremely high barrier to entry *and* ongoing burden on the user. This overhead is exceedingly difficult to overcome for any kind of ongoing work.

        - These problems are well-documented in the classic "Formality Considered Harmful: Experiences, Emerging Themes, and Directions on the Use of Formal Representations in Interactive Systems" [[@shipmanFormalityConsideredHarmful1999]]. In brief, this paper identifies four classes of difficulties:

In brief, this paper identifies four classes of difficulties:

            1. Cognitive overhead (aka [[Cognitive Load]]): often the task of specifying formalism is extraneous to the primary task, or is just plain annoying to do

            1. [[tacit knowledge]]: if relevant info for developing formalism is tacit, asking people to formalize it will interrupt the task, with serious consequences for the quality of the work

            1. [[Enforcing Premature Structure]]: people don't want to commit until they're sure what formalism is actually useful for their task (and what's extraneous and only annoying)

            1. [[Situational Structure]]: ((LhqpJ_jeV))

- if it‚Äôs more ‚Äúbusiness-related‚Äù reasons, like can‚Äôt find a large enough market, can‚Äôt go mainstream, that‚Äôs less interesting to me; but if it‚Äôs more fundamental (e.g., [[[[[[CLM]] - Knowledge is fundamentally contextual]], [[[[CLM]] - Gracefully integrating formalism into interactive systems is hard]]), then that‚Äôs more interesting and worth working on

    - nevertheless, important to keep these past ‚Äúfailures‚Äù in mind, since the larger vision is so dimilar

    - reminds me also of [[Benjamin Reinhardt]]‚Äôs comments about the [[sys/Memex]] as a philosophers stone in computing: cautionary note about whether it‚Äôs actually at all possible

    - could also be as simple as they weren't serious enough, as [this article](https://qz.com/480741/this-free-online-encyclopedia-has-achieved-what-wikipedia-can-only-dream-of/) on the success of the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] suggests

- There's also the fundamental problem of [[[[CLM]] - Gracefully integrating formalism into interactive systems is hard]] that [[I don't know]] how to solve yet.

    - [[I wonder]] how easy it is to transition from the relatively playful association-style structure to more powerful structured representations for [[synthesis]] like [[causal models]] (cf. [[Judea Pearl]] and [[Bayesian Networks]])

    - This is also related to the problem that [[[[CLM]] - Specifying context for future reuse is costly]]; both of these problems combine to create strong barriers to a shared synthesis infrastructure.

        - Again I think the problem sharpens considerably when we move from the individual [[PIM]] framing to consider how to share. Adding in [[reuse]], basically.

            - This sharpens the question of the [[P: Synthesis requirements theory paper]]: not just "how do we need to design tools to support synthesis", but

            - Another question then: are we talking about [[Collaborative]] synthesis, or something more like [[FLOSS development]], where we don't have direct coordination going on? Thinking of ideas like [[stigmergy]] and [[Stigmergic Coordination]] (main entry point for the latter is [[@boliciStigmergicCoordinationFLOSS2016]])

            - [[I wonder]] how we might design an "intermediate layer" between private and public knowledge?

                - Going back to [[@gruberDarwinManPsychological1974]] Idea of [[[[QUE]] - How can we best bridge private vs. public knowledge?]] is described very well here, and one of the central tensions of explaining the development of Darwin's idea of man

- [[[[CLM]] - Gracefully integrating formalism into interactive systems is hard]] aka formality considered harmful

    - more generally, lack of widespread adoption of structured systems like argument-mapping software
