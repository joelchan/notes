    - Description:

        - Partially motivated by Why is paper so good? ^^[[[[CLM]] - Analog media are stubbornly effective for supporting creative knowledge work]]!^^

        - Important to think about the **system** as a whole, as a [[distributed cognition]] system.

            - For example: Really inspired by the idea of [[Passive-Dynamic Walkers]] (#example-of [[Morphological Computation]] and [[distributed cognition]]), and how that relates to [[Tools for Thought]], while reading [[@clarkSupersizingMindEmbodiment2010]] A few key observations that stand out to me:

            - These empirical and design insights have grounding in the idea that cognition is embodied, situated, and distributed [[@clarkSupersizingMindEmbodiment2010]], [[@klemmerHowBodiesMatter2006]], [[@hollanDistributedCognitionNew2000]], [[@greenoSituativityKnowingLearning1998]]: cognitive processes are not just "influenced by" tools and environments and embodied states; they are also "implemented" in a distributed "hardware", of which the brain is but one component alongside other materials such as other people, tools, and the structure of one's environment.

        - If we do this, we can ask: how does a distributed system that includes an analog workflow and a human brain accomplish the requirements of [[compression]], [[context]], and [[compositionality]]?

        - The brain actually is doing a LOT of the work! The external spaces are part of the system, but the data model encompasses more than the scratches on paper or on the whiteboard. We can gain insight into this by noticing how things cluster or repeat over time across different media, both in the head and in the world.

        - This might be one reason that [[Andy Matuschak]] and [[Michael Nielsen]] think that [[[[CLM]] - The most transformative insights must come from a single "mind"]]. Because it's really challenging to (or we haven't yet figured out how to) enable a medium with data model properties of [[compression]], [[context]], and [[compositionality]] that spans multiple minds; a distributed system that enfolds or spans more than one mind and their workflow.

            - Our current workaround is to have people spend LOTS of time together in an intense collaboration to get to the point where this is possible, or to have people who are very similar already get together.

            - But there is a very [significant barrier]([[[[CLM]] - Interdisciplinary teamwork is hard]]) to team-based [[Convergence]] because of this bottleneck of not being able to have a shared "dataset" of ideas that satisfy the properties. Our external representations that are **shareable** lack one or more of those properties. We've designed models for some that could have these properties, but nobody will use them.

                - Also: [[Charles Darwin]] did the theory of evolution with a paper notebook! Ditto Einstein, [[Richard Feynman]], etc. [[@americaninstituteofphysicsInterviewRichardFeyman2015]]

        - We also see a quite diverse (fragmented?) [[ecology of tools]] in [[@qianOpeningBlackBox2020]]
