    - Description:

        - Partially motivated by Why is paper so good? ^^[[CLM - Analog media are stubbornly effective for supporting creative knowledge work]]

        - Important to think about the **system** as a whole, as a [[distributed cognition]]

            - For example: Really inspired by the idea of [[Passive-Dynamic Walkers]]

            - These empirical and design insights have grounding in the idea that cognition is embodied, situated, and distributed [[@clarkSupersizingMindEmbodiment2010]]

        - If we do this, we can ask: how does a distributed system that includes an analog workflow and a human brain accomplish the requirements of [[compression]]

        - The brain actually is doing a LOT of the work! The external spaces are part of the system, but the data model encompasses more than the scratches on paper or on the whiteboard. We can gain insight into this by noticing how things cluster or repeat over time across different media, both in the head and in the world.

        - This might be one reason that [[Andy Matuschak]]

            - Our current workaround is to have people spend LOTS of time together in an intense collaboration to get to the point where this is possible, or to have people who are very similar already get together.

            - But there is a very [significant barrier]([[CLM - Interdisciplinary teamwork is hard]]

                - Also: [[Charles Darwin]]

        - We also see a quite diverse (fragmented?) [[ecology of tools]]
