    - Description:

        - Partially motivated by Why is paper so good? ^^[[[[CLM]] - Analog media are stubbornly effective for supporting creative knowledge work]]!^^

        - Important to think about the **system** as a whole, as a [[distributed cognition]] system.

            - For example: Really inspired by the idea of [[Passive-Dynamic Walkers]] (#example-of [[Morphological Computation]] and [[distributed cognition]]), and how that relates to [[Tools for Thought]], while reading [[@clarkSupersizingMindEmbodiment2010]] A few key observations that stand out to me:

            - These empirical and design insights have grounding in the idea that cognition is embodied, situated, and distributed [[@clarkSupersizingMindEmbodiment2010]], [[@klemmerHowBodiesMatter2006]], [[@hollanDistributedCognitionNew2000]], [[@greenoSituativityKnowingLearning1998]]: cognitive processes are not just "influenced by" tools and environments and embodied states; they are also "implemented" in a distributed "hardware", of which the brain is but one component alongside other materials such as other people, tools, and the structure of one's environment.

        - If we do this, we can ask: how does a distributed system that includes an analog workflow and a human brain accomplish the requirements of [[compression]], [[context]], and [[compositionality]]?

        - The brain actually is doing a LOT of the work! The external spaces are part of the system, but the data model encompasses more than the scratches on paper or on the whiteboard. We can gain insight into this by noticing how things cluster or repeat over time across different media, both in the head and in the world.

        - This might be one reason that [[Andy Matuschak]] and [[Michael Nielsen]] think that [[[[CLM]] - The most transformative insights must come from a single "mind"]]. Because it's really challenging to (or we haven't yet figured out how to) enable a medium with data model properties of [[compression]], [[context]], and [[compositionality]] that spans multiple minds; a distributed system that enfolds or spans more than one mind and their workflow.

            - Our current workaround is to have people spend LOTS of time together in an intense collaboration to get to the point where this is possible, or to have people who are very similar already get together.

            - But there is a very [significant barrier]([[[[CLM]] - Interdisciplinary teamwork is hard]]) to team-based [[Convergence]] because of this bottleneck of not being able to have a shared "dataset" of ideas that satisfy the properties. Our external representations that are **shareable** lack one or more of those properties. We've designed models for some that could have these properties, but nobody will use them.

                - Also: [[Charles Darwin]] did the theory of evolution with a paper notebook! Ditto Einstein, [[Richard Feynman]], etc. [[@americaninstituteofphysicsInterviewRichardFeyman2015]]

        - We also see a quite diverse (fragmented?) [[ecology of tools]] in [[@qianOpeningBlackBox2020]]

- Thinking about [[[[CLM]] - Where possible, design systems, not tools]], and also [[tacit knowledge]].

    - If it's hard to make [[tacit knowledge]] explicit, and at least some of the power of systems for thinking (e.g., [[sys/Zettelkasten]]) is in the **practice** of it, and at least some of that practice is [[tacit knowledge]], are we on a fool's errand to try and describe this scientifically?

    - I don't think so. But I also think that the frame of cognitive modeling (in the tradition of [[expert systems]] or [[cognitive task analysis]]) may be the wrong way to go about it?

    - I'm thinking that the right methods come from a mix of places that study **practice** (culture) and tools. [[Ethnomethodology]]? Sociology?

    - We study experts who have developed systems that work for them, and we try to provide thick, [[context]]ualized descriptions of their [[distributed cognition]] system, a mix of mindsets, practices/routines, cognitive mechanisms and operations, materials/media [[affordances]] and tools...
[[June 14th, 2020]]

- Reminds me of #[[[[CLM]] - Where possible, design systems, not tools]]

    - There's a deeper idea in here of "the tool feels like it's an extension of me". I think it's related to [[distributed cognition]], but it's not the same...
[[November 7th, 2020]]

- but then we also need facilitators/trainers to help export the *system* ([not just the tool]([[[[CLM]] - Where possible, design systems, not tools]]))

    - could be similar to the [[librarian reserve corps]] that [[Jodi Schneider]] talked about

    - also reminds me of brainstorming training, [[Wardley Mapping]], and [[software carpentry]]
[[June 6th, 2020]]

- Also wondering if it's productive to drop the constraint of fitting into "3 things" for now, and start bottom-up. What properties or [[affordances]] do we want our system, [broadly construed]([[[[CLM]] - Where possible, design systems, not tools]]), to have?

    - Then see if the 3 or 4-cut clustering makes the most sense

    - Some nuances: [[Atomicity]] is a property (similar to [[Multiplicity]]), but [[[[context]]ualizability]] and [[compositionality]] feel more like [[affordances]]
[[October 25th, 2021]]

- Lots of thoughts about [[[[CLM]] - Where possible, design systems, not tools]] and [[[[CLM]] - Analog media are stubbornly effective for supporting creative knowledge work]]

    - [[Cedric Chin]] exemplifies an elaborate nontraditional system, where he skips straight to the publishing part of the [[Digital Garden]] workflow, in his blog

    - This makes me remember how many faculty I've seen seem to use their collaborators *and their grants/manuscripts* as access points for their memory

        - It's not optimal, but it might be pretty close, and sure as hell is optimal from the standpoint of minimizing distance between their "process" and their "output" (their process space is literally their output space)

            - Wondering if the costs are more long-term: harder to remix ideas, calcification....?

    - The other thought this sparks is a connection back to [[@luttersIdentifyingExpertiseMarkers2004]] [[micronotes]] and [[@bernsteinInformationScrapsHow2008]] information scraps (from [[Max Van Kleek]])

        - The **opportunity cost** of having a formalism that excludes really really important elements, is too high to adopt for creative knowledge work

            - This is a subset or specific instantiation of the general [[[[CLM]] - (premature) formalism considered harmful]]

            - In this case, a formalism that excludes speculation, for example, or rough scraps that we don't know what to do with yet, will prematurely kill the creative process

                - Really hitting the theme of how important it is to have the informal live alongside the formal: asked about [[abduction]], and where that lives in here - my sense is that [[[[PTN]] - discourse graph]] don't represent abduction, but support it (by having something to talk back to); similar to [[Chinmay Kulkarni]]'s question about speculation

                - {{embed: Another goes back to the idea of how we can best evaluate interventions into the creative process, knowing that it is a complex dynamical system that is constantly in flux. ((need to refactor this high-level zettelkasten: [[[[CLM]] - Ideas develop simultaneously at multiple timescales, levels of granularity, and completeness]]) A myopic focus on "did it give me something right now that I can recognize as immediately useful" is very dangerous.}}

            - [[@ackermanIntellectualChallengeCSCW2000]] throughout this piece i am mentally translating "social activity" for "sensemaking" or "creative knowledge work" or "synthesis" - e.g., "{social activity | synthesis work} is fluid and nuanced, and this makes systems technically difficult to construct properly and often awkward to use" (p. 181)

- Scratch thoughts about notetaking again, from representation to ?? (something something [[[[CLM]] - Where possible, design systems, not tools]])

    - great ppl don't use notetaking systems. bullshit.

    - do they have routines? do they do things? do they shape their environment in any repeatable way? do they have people they regularly talk to? this is their "tool for thought". or rather, their [[[[PTN]] - enabling environment]]. this

    - cf. [[ecological psychology]]

    - cf. [[distributed cognition]]

    - our notes aren't (or at least, don't have to be) representations or records. they're our environment that we can shape, just like other aspects of

    - understanding this is extremely important

    - it matters for quality control

    - it matters for structuring

        - what kind of environment and interactions and movements and dynamics do you want to foster?

    - critics are right about one thing though: thinking about a tool for thought in terms of what tool you use is dangerously narrow.
