    - Description

        - Lots of little details you need to get just right, or it falls apart: Nice #example-of [[[[CLM]] - Visual thinking interfaces are tricky to get right]] - need to balance auto-layout with freedom to move things around; hard to scale well

        - Maybe because in these media you're really after FLUIDITY: that's the whole game. And any small thing that throws it off just nukes the whole thing; not a graceful failure. Whereas if your CLI is a bit slower, maybe that's ok? Doesn't have to feel super fluid? Idk.

        - Argument:

            - To do serious, scalable work, you need to have some kind of [[zoomable user interface]], in part because [[[[CLM]] - Compression is necessary for synthesis]]
