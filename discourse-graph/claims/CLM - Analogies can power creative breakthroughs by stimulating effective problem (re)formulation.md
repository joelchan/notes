    - Description

        - An [analogy might be so analogically distant]([[far analogies]]

        - For example, [[@dorstFrameInnovationCreate2015]]

        - This process of [problem formulation is a critical path to breakthrough innovation.]([[CLM - Effective problem formulation is-necessary-for creative knowledge work]]

        - Some pioneering early work was done by Bhatta, Goel, and Prabhakar ([1994]([[@bhattaInnovationAnalogicalDesign1994]]

            - Helms, Vattam, and Goel (2008) conducted semester-long in situ observations of student design teams learning to systematically draw inspiration from biology to solve engineering design problems, and [described a process of incremental analogical modification, where analogical mappings incrementally modified and co-evolved with the functional decomposition of the design problem]([[EVD - Engineering design students used multiple cross-domain analogies to fulfill design needs, and...on of how to decompose the problem and find new analogies. - @helmsCompoundAnalogicalDesign2008]]
