    - Description

        - An [analogy might be so analogically distant]([[far analogies]]) that thinking about it [restructures]([[problem (re)formulation]]) the problem representation in such a way that access to a relevant analog or creative idea becomes now ‚Äúopen‚Äù, e.g., through relaxing of constraints or [chunk decompositions]([[chunk decomposition]]) ([Knoblich et al, 1999]([[@knoblichConstraintRelaxationChunk1999]])).

        - For example, [[@dorstFrameInnovationCreate2015]] described a case where Designers used an [[analogy]] to a music festival to (re)frame the problem of night violence in King's Cross from a crime prevention/reduction problem to an entertainment frame

        - This process of [problem formulation is a critical path to breakthrough innovation.]([[[[CLM]] - Effective problem formulation is-necessary-for creative knowledge work]])

        - Some pioneering early work was done by Bhatta, Goel, and Prabhakar ([1994]([[@bhattaInnovationAnalogicalDesign1994]])), who computationally modeled how analogies can trigger reformulation of the design problem by discovering new constraints.

            - Helms, Vattam, and Goel (2008) conducted semester-long in situ observations of student design teams learning to systematically draw inspiration from biology to solve engineering design problems, and [described a process of incremental analogical modification, where analogical mappings incrementally modified and co-evolved with the functional decomposition of the design problem]([[[[EVD]] - Engineering design students used multiple cross-domain analogies to fulfill design needs, and they could use analogies to get inspiration of how to decompose the problem and find new analogies. - [[@helmsCompoundAnalogicalDesign2008]]]]).

            - [[[[EVD]] - Two artists used individual artworks to shape not just their ideas, but used a process of "analogical modification" to search for and modify higher-order concepts, and their creative vision. This process unfolded over the course of years. - [[@okadaAnalogicalModificationCreation2009]]]]

        - [[@jeppesenMarginalityProblemsolvingEffectiveness2010]] also hint at this mechanism in describing the benefits of [[outsider innovation]] potentially running through having access to novel problem perspectives, not just heuristics (solution)
