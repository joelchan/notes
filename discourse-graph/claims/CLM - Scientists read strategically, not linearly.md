    - Description

        - Practicing scientists typically don't read papers cover-to-cover in a linear fashion. Strategic reading is the rule, rather than the exception.

        - #[[@renearStrategicReadingOntologies2009]] claim that scientists have always read strategically, but there is some evidence this is increasing in intensity as the volume of literature grows and more of it is consumed online. It's hard to say for sure how much of this is a good thing, but thinking about reading as sitting within processes of [[ðŸ§± sensemaking]] and [[active reading]] suggests that at least some proportion of the strategic reading behaviors are adaptive.
