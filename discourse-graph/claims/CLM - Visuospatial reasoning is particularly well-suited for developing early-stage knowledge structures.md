- [[@marshallVIKISpatialHypertext1994]]: ["a visual/spatial metaphor for hypertext allows people to express the nuances of structure, especially ambiguous, partial, or emerging structure, more easily"](Abstract:: The emergent nature of structure is a crucial, but often ignored, constraint on authoring hypertexts. VIKI is a spatial hypertext system that supports the emergent qualities of structure and the abstractions that guide its creation. We have found that ^^a visual/spatial metaphor for hypertext allows people to express the nuances of structure, especialy ambiguous, partial, or emerging structure, more easily^^. VIKI supports interpretation of a collected body of materials, a task that becomes increasingly important with the availability of on-line information sources. The tool's data model includes semi-structured objects, collections that provide the basis for spatial navigation, and object composites, all of which may evolve into types. A spatial parser supports this evolution and enhances user interaction with changing, visually apparent organizations.)
