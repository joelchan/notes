    - Description

        - [[synthesis]]

            - In [[ðŸ§± sensemaking]]

                - ([faisalClassificationSensemakingRepresentations2009](#Claim There are six types of [[ðŸ§± sensemaking]]

            - Epistemological models of scientific discovery argue that scientists construct theories as systems of scientific statements, which are **composed of** relationships between concepts ([harsDesigningScientificKnowledge2001](Four [[Positivist]]

            - [[Z Synthesis is a creative act]]

                - The idea of pairwise conceptual combination is similar to 5: Dialectical resolution (p. 350) as noted by [[@strikeTypesSynthesisTheir1983]]

        - We can also look at examples of intellectual acts that do not seem to produce something more than the sum of their parts.

            - Classic undifferentiated list, as noted in [[@holbrookLevelsSuccessUse2008]]

                - So, idea of "parts, not whole"? Assemblage? Can't transcend the sum of the parts. Or might not even have the sum.

                - The idea of a conceptually new whole construction is in contrast with what we often see in related work sections and literature reviews, which are much more about assemblage, often listing in chronological or author-order, what things have been done, what topics have been covered, with little to no synthesis into a coherent new whole.

                    - In this vein, [[systematic review]]

                        - It's not just that they're more easily done in well-structured domains where we have a bit more agreement.

                        - It's also that these [[systematic review]]

                            - Granted, good reviews (especially [[mmeta-analysis]]

                                - Especially in medicine (e.g., [[Cochrane systematic reviews]]
