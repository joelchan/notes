- As of [[May 12th, 2020]], on [[ROHub]], there are ~90 "active users" for [[std/Research Objects]]
- [[@kuhnNanopublicationsGrowingResource2018]] reports around 10 million [[std/Nanopublications]] published at the time of writing, albeit almost all within bioinformatics, and overwhelmingly dominated by a small (N=41!!) set of authors
- [[@schrimlCOVID19PandemicReveals2020]] report that in the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC, [www.insdc.org](http://www.insdc.org)) there are 2.1 million Sequence Read Archive (SRA) experiments listed under the taxonomy term “metagenomes”, less than 33% of which are tagged with environment metadata. Although published descriptions of metagenomic datasets are generally associated with enriched metadata describing the environment, source material, and sequencing technology, and in theory it is possible for one to read the manuscripts (including figures, tables and supplementary information) and gather that information, this is an onerous task when dealing with multiple studies. It also means multiple researchers potentially repeating the same work of trawling for metadata, resulting in significant researcher-hours that could be better spent actually interrogating the data.
- [[@kuhnGenuineSemanticPublishing2017]] also argues that much of what is being published under the heading of [[semantic publishing]] may fall short of the original vision "genuine" semantic publishing.
- this is especially true for efforts that follow the [[specialized [[curator]] model of semantic publishing]]

    - the amazing [[sys/Mark2Cure]] effort [[@tsuengApplyingCitizenScience2019]] had to shutter their effort in September of [[2019]]: the stated reason was that they did not feel that they could curate enough knowledge to uncover clues for identifying potential treatment strategies for NGLY1-deficiency [[@gingerThankYouVolunteers2019]]
