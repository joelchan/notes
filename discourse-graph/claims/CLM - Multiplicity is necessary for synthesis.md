    - Description

        - [[Multiplicity]]

        - Redundancy is good. Need multiple points of access to ideas. Might be an additional reason that [[CLM - Contextualizability is necessary for synthesis]]

        - [[Multiplicity]]

        - This seems to conflict also with the idea of [[formality]]

            - See, e.g., [[@halfordDigitalFuturesSociological2013]]

        - See also: [[CLM - Ideas develop simultaneously at multiple timescales, levels of granularity, and completeness]]
