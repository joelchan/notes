    - Description

        - [[Multiplicity]] is necessary for [[synthesis]]

        - Redundancy is good. Need multiple points of access to ideas. Might be an additional reason that [[[[CLM]] - Contextualizability is necessary for synthesis]] and a point in favor of [[compositionality]] over [[formality]]

        - [[Multiplicity]] - to fight against the notion of there being a single source of universal truth? Connection to [[sys/Federated Wikis]]? Not sure if helpful to bring this out as its own thing, might just be a clarification on top of [[compositionality]] (i.e., dispelling hidden assumption that we need total/global [[URIs]]) cc [[@halfordDigitalFuturesSociological2013]], taking seriously the idea that [[[[CLM]] - Knowledge is fundamentally contextual]]

        - This seems to conflict also with the idea of [[formality]] in the strong sense of wanting totally (globally) unique identifiers.

            - See, e.g., [[@halfordDigitalFuturesSociological2013]] ((0uPL7PbTu)) [[@halfordDigitalFuturesSociological2013]]
