    - Description

        - Breaking ideas down into their __component parts__ allows us to **creatively reinterpret ideas for new purposes**, such as creating a new understanding of a problem, or creatively [[reuse]]

        - In [[Insight problem solving]]

            - People create chunks to organize experience. ((kJ0JodSt_))

            - Encountering a novel problem activates some chunks from past experiences. Not all of them will be helpful; and some will be actively unhelpful. And some will need to be decomposed ([[compression]]
