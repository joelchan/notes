    - Description

        - Breaking ideas down into their __component parts__ allows us to **creatively reinterpret ideas for new purposes**, such as creating a new understanding of a problem, or creatively [[reuse]] ideas in new contexts.

        - In [[Insight problem solving]], there is the idea of [[chunk decomposition]] (see, e.g., [[@knoblichConstraintRelaxationChunk1999]]). The basic idea goes something like this:

            - People create chunks to organize experience. ((kJ0JodSt_))

            - Encountering a novel problem activates some chunks from past experiences. Not all of them will be helpful; and some will be actively unhelpful. And some will need to be decomposed ([[compression]] reversed??)

            - [Evidence]([[SupportedBy]]) for this comes from experiments where [[chunk decomposition]] was impaired, leading to worse performance on solving the problem (see, e.g.,  [knoblichConstraintRelaxationChunk1999]([[[[EVD]] - People were ~2x worse at solving matchstick arithmetic problems when the elements were harder to decompose into chunks - [[@knoblichConstraintRelaxationChunk1999]]]])).

        - [[@mccaffreyInnovationReliesObscure2012]] has extended this idea to detail how being able to "break down" an idea or object and see its component [[obscure features]] in a **__function-free__** manner is a powerful strategy for breaking [[ðŸ§± fixation]] by creatively recombining objects to come up with novel solutions.
