        - [[@blakeCollaborativeInformationSynthesis2006]] some types of [[context]] information were more contextual, depending on the particular "hypothesis projection" of the review, which varied across the lifecycle of the project studied (e.g., location of medical condition, amount of exposure, confounding risk factors), while others were more constant regardless of hypothesis (e.g., study- and population-context information)
