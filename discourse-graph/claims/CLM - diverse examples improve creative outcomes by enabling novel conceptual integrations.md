    - The next functional outcome of integrating builds on the previous ones: rather than transferring or repurposing elements from a single example, ^^this outcome^^ . Sometimes this combination leads to a new whole that is greater than the sum of its parts, with [[emergent properties]].

    - Examples of this include...

    - The lit on this includes...

    - the whole thing with fixation in insight problem solving is needing to see them as more/less than what they are! maier's two string problem, gotta see the strings as pendulums, not just things to tie with, and [[Duncker's candle problem]], and the whole [[chunk decomposition]] thing (they're not numerals, they're matches!)
