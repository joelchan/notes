    - Description

        - Analogies are rarely a perfect match. There are always some mismatches.

        - Sometimes these mismatches are on "core" attributes, that seem "critical" to the problem. For example, someone working on nanoscale heat transfer may find it very important that any analogical match respect the core attribute of scale (nano).

            - The idea of "core" attributes is closely related to the core [[analogy]]

        - We frequently see in our attempts to provide analogical inspirations to real-world creatives (e.g., scientists, engineers, designers), that [[CLM - People rapidly reject analogical matches when there is a clear attribute mismatch]]

        - However, the effect of core attribute mismatches on creativity is controversial. There are competing effects / explanations

            - [[CLM - Core attribute mismatches in analogical inspiration harm creativity]]

            - [[CLM - Core mismatches in analogical inspiration improve creativity]]

        - What might explain the mixed effects of attribute mismatches on creative output?

            - One important distinction might be the **timescale / immediacy** of the effect of the analogy, with positive and negative impacts showing up at different timescales.

                - For example, there is some evidence that [[CLM - Paths to creative breakthroughs are frequently oblique]]

                    - We sort of inch towards something like this in our experiments with [[Hyeonsu]]

                        - To be more precise, though, we're still evaluating the "worth" of individual ideas, instead of considering its downstream effects, which would be closer to the idea in [[THE - Accretion theory of ideation]]

                - So maybe the way to think about this is in terms of different mechanisms or pathways of inspiration?

                    - More direct path --> try to match on key domain constraints and attributes

                    - More indirect path (not sure if higher ceiling, might just be needed for different problems) --> ignore matching, use [[generative misalignment]]

            - Separately, maybe there needs  [[CLM - There is a 'Sweet Spot' in Analogical Distance. Somewhat far analogies lead to better creative outcomes than very near or very far analogies]]

                - could put an upper bound on what domains are actually useful: need to have some critical threshold of [[Z Alignable differences]]

            - Could be mediated by whether those mismatches are on [[Z Alignable differences]]
