    - Description

        - Amongst doctoral students: [[[[CLM]] - Doctoral students struggle to effectively synthesize literature]]

        - Amongst review papers

            - There is definitely a sense in the scholarly air that review papers (though immensely valuable to a field) are very hard to write, and somewhat of a "fool's errand" for [[ECRs]]. But I'm wondering now about the numbers and precision behind this sense. __Are__ review papers really all that rare?

            - Chewing again on this thread: ((aIg1IBAPE)) on [[[[CLM]] - Effective synthesis is rare]] / [[[[CLM]] - Effective synthesis is hard]]

        - In regular manuscripts

            - ((-25jBwY60)) (from [[@greifenederApplesVsOranges2017]])

        - Possibly because #[[[[CLM]] - Effective synthesis is hard]]

        - Also #[[Z: Publishing review papers is hard]]

    - R-Sources

            - #Claim Only about 20% of published [[systematic review]]s in orthondotics are "good" by [[AMSTAR standards of review quality]]; 20% are considered "poor"! (Table 2, p.246) #synthesis

        - #[[@booteScholarsResearchersCentrality2005]]

            - the level of synthesis in regular manuscripts frequently subpar (p.4)

            - [[[[EVD]] - approximately one-third of criticisms in reviews of submitted manuscripts for a teacher education journal were directly related to inadequacies in synthesis - [[@alton-leeTroubleshooterChecklistProspective1998]]]]
