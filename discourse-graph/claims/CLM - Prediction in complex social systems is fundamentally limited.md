    - Description

        - "speed limit"!

        - Original idea for me from [[@martinExploringLimitsPrediction2016]]: given an insane amount of data on Twitter, best models can only explain less than half of the variance in information cascades

        - More recent interesting example: trying to predict life outcomes with an insane amount of data on real people from a longitudinal study (+ very motivated kitchen sink modeling competition) yields very poor predictive power (best-performing model is ~25% of variance explained)  [[@salganikMeasuringPredictabilityLife2020]]

        - So be careful about modeling results like some of the results under [[[[CLM]] - Prestige substantially controls how scientific ideas spread]] - simulations ok, models... be careful!

    - the latter point here might be related to why [[[[CLM]] - Paths to creative breakthroughs are frequently oblique]], and it's really really hard to judge creative ideas! [[[[QUE]] - Is it possible to measure creativity in a scientifically precise way? If so, how?]]
