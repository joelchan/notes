        - Original idea for me from [[@martinExploringLimitsPrediction2016]]

        - More recent interesting example: trying to predict life outcomes with an insane amount of data on real people from a longitudinal study (+ very motivated kitchen sink modeling competition) yields very poor predictive power (best-performing model is ~25% of variance explained)  [[@salganikMeasuringPredictabilityLife2020]]

        - So be careful about modeling results like some of the results under [[CLM - Prestige substantially controls how scientific ideas spread]]
