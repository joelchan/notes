    - Description:

        - Having someone show you in the moment how to do something is often the most effective way to satisfy a "knowledge-how" information need.

        - However, other sources can also provide varying levels of satisfaction; for example, tutorial or how-to videos are often more effective than a sequence of instructions, no matter how well written. But a sequence of instructions with well-chosen pictures might approximate the effectiveness of a video.

        - This intuition has been thoroughly explored in [[CSCW]] research on knowledge sharing, which as largely moved on from a "repository model" (mostly well-suited for storing and communicating "knowledge-that" in documents and databases) to an "expertise sharing model" that incorporates direct communication with knowledgeable individuals, to better accommodate the frequent need for "knowledge-how" that is more tacit and situated.

        - Similarly, the well-known concept of [[communities of practice]] was proposed in part to account for the fact that much valuable knowledge in organizations is tacit and cannot be represented in formal repositories; instead, they are best captured and shared in communities of practice.

        - [[[[CLM]] - CSCW research on knowledge sharing shifted from a repository model to an expertise sharing model around the mid-2000's - [[@ackermanSharingKnowledgeExpertise2013]]]] [[@ackermanSharingKnowledgeExpertise2013]]

        - The shift from the "[[repository model]]" of CSCW work to focus on "[[expertise sharing]]" was stimulated in large part by rich discoveries about the large extent to which useful knowledge is tacit and situated #[[tacit knowledge]] p.547 [[@ackermanSharingKnowledgeExpertise2013]]

        - [[communities of practice]] are able to capture and share [[tacit knowledge]] that are difficult or impossible to represent in formal repositories p.5 [[@wengerCommunitiesPracticeLearning1998]]
