    - Description

        - #> "Infrastructure, when itâ€™s working, you donâ€™t notice itâ€¦. [I]deally youâ€™re not concerned about it at all â€“ itâ€™s just there. You take it for granted. Itâ€™s only when you travel to someplace like this [Brussels] and you realise you left your bloody plug [adaptor] and you canâ€™t get [something] working â€“ thatâ€™s when you start noticing infrastructure, when it fails or when itâ€™s incompatible" - Geoffrey Bilder, OpenCon2015
