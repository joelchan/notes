    - it's not enough to understand the "extra stakeholders" as extra... they're not! at least some of them are an integral part of the design world, providing key [[funds of knowledge]], and restorative relationships

        - sorting this out is KEY when designing the third places

        - and Ps. Taylor exemplifying the concept of "[[communitizer]]" as a role of "extra stakeholders" (in the case of [[Science Everywhere]], the different roles of adults in the community who served as volunteers

        - see example of Tammy! her friends coming alongside her to support her and enable her to learn, providing support and opportunities for learning in multiple "[[third space]]s

[[QUE - What tension points exist between the goals of diversity and depth of user participation in participatory design]]

- But a more subtle, perhaps less obvious issue comes from the **increased presence of extra stakeholders**, who may need to be involved in special ways because of the user population, whether it is for reasons of access, legality, or necessity. [[[[CLM]] - Marginalized user populations may require involvement of extra stakeholders who may complicate hearing the users' voices]]

        - Their presence changes power dynamics and can lead to [participants' voices being lost in translation]([[[[CLM]] - There is a tension between analyzing participants' direct inputs, and respecting their actual insights (vs. designers' interpretation) that is intensified when working with design partners who struggle to contribute more directly to design artifacts]]) [[@gautamParticipatoryTensionsWorking2018]([[[[EVD]] - Sex-trafficking survivor organization staff members would sometimes speak of and for the survivors when talking about their needs - [[@gautamParticipatoryTensionsWorking2018]]]]), [@frauenbergerInterpretingInputChildren2012b]([[[[EVD]] - in design sessions with children, there were tensions between interpretation of the participant voice v. the stakeholder [[@frauenbergerInterpretingInputChildren2012b]]]])] or negotation.

        - Examples include sex-trafficking survivor organizations [[@gautamParticipatoryTensionsWorking2018]([[[[EVD]] - Sex-trafficking survivor organization staff members would sometimes speak of and for the survivors when talking about their needs - [[@gautamParticipatoryTensionsWorking2018]]]])], politically appointed local government officials in rural areas [[@ssozi-mugaruraSupportingCommunityNeeds2016]([[[[EVD]] - Intermediaries such as local government officials were necessary for accessing and co-designing with marginalized populations, but the intermediaries sometimes spoke for the people in ways that opposed what they really wanted - [[@ssozi-mugaruraSupportingCommunityNeeds2016]]]]), teachers or helpers of neurodiverse children [[@frauenbergerDesigningSmartObjects2016a]([[[[EVD]] - Teachers and helpers needed to be present in the beginning of PD session to help and make sure children were comfortable but were not needed in future sessions [[@frauenbergerDesigningSmartObjects2016a]]]])], advocates of prisoners [[@tengParticipatoryDesignVirtual2019b]([[[[EVD]] - Working with an advocate within the prison system allowed researchers to navigate bureaucratic hierarchy with relative ease - @tengParticipatoryDesignVirtual2019b]])], or apartment complex authorities on site [[@harringtonDeconstructingCommunityBasedCollaborative2019]([[[[EVD]] - Black and LatinX codesign participants were reluctant to fully disclose past experiences bc they perceived researchers as connected to outsider authorities who could harm them - [[@harringtonDeconstructingCommunityBasedCollaborative2019]]]])]

- but this might be complicated, and lead to the ["extra stakeholders" power dynamic]([[[[CLM]] - Marginalized user populations may require involvement of extra stakeholders who may complicate hearing the users' voices]])

    - might put an upper limit on how deep you can go, e.g., stuck at the "informant level", per [[Bonded Design]] [[@largeBondedDesignNovel2006]] and the onion model

        - inescapable power dynamics between adults and children

        - shorter (weeks vs. a year +), ad-hoc design teams (vs. [[Cooperative Inquiry]])

            - this means the participants are only involved in narrower slices of the design process

        - similar issues seen in [[@foss2013cooperative]]
