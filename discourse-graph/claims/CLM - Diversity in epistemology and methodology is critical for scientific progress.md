- Generally a good idea; see [[@richHowHardCognitive2021]]
- Sometimes you can't run the kind of experiments you want! Need to integrate across diverse data [*](Sometimes you can't run the kind of experiments you want! Need to integrate across diverse data)

    - A good example of this is taking place in evidence-based medicine, where . One reason that this shift is needed is that domain under study makes it difficult to run the kinds of evidence that are preferred under a certain framework: the issue of face masks and other non-pharmaceutical interventions against COVID-19 is a particularly salient example: as [[@howardFaceMasksCOVID192020]]

- And sometimes you just need local knowledge, particularly for problem-solving research! [*](And sometimes you just need local knowledge, particularly for problem-solving research!)

    - Beyond the general importance of epistemic diversity for synthesis, the issue of the divide between what is perceived as traditionally rigorous scientific evidence, and more local, contextualized practical knowledge, is particularly salient for research that aims to __design__ solutions for societally important problems. Here, researchers must accomplish the difficult task of integrating knowledge from epistemological approaches that emphasize local, contextual knowledge (in order to design solutions that can actually work in particular contexts) with knowledge from epistemological approaches that emphasize identifying more abstract, formal models (in order to identify powerful design principles that make it possible to transfer and generalize solutions across particular settings) [[@krohnInterdisciplinaryCasesDisciplinary2017]]

    - Lack of epistemic diversity can also severely hamper progress in problem domains such as misinformation and polarization as well as educational technology, where critical knowledge is distributed across not just formal research theory and evidence, but also highly local and practical knowledge amongst practitioners. An important example of this is the difficulties of transferring the benefits of cognitive tutors, which have experimentally demonstrated gains, to classrooms, particularly in settings like rural classrooms in Latin American countries where local knowledge about collaborative behavior and time away from computers were needed to better design for the context [[@oganCollaborationCognitiveTutor2012]]
- A deeper issue: in societally impactful problems, especially ones with disproportionate impact on marginalized populations, histories of marginalization of different ways of knowing, particularly local knowledge, can be particularly at issue [*](A deeper issue: in societally impactful problems, especially ones with disproportionate impact on marginalized populations, histories of marginalization of different ways of knowing, particularly local knowledge, can be particularly at issue)
