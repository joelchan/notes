    - Description

        - This is in part because [[[[CL]] - Synthesis is-necessary-for effective problem formulation]]

        - A #> I really like on this is from [[Allen Newell]] [[@newellYouCanPlay1973]]: #> "You can't play 20 questions with nature and win".

            - #> from [[Jean Piaget]] in preface to [[@gruberDarwinManPsychological1974]] #> : ‚Äúa new scientific theory differs from a simple ‚Äúreading‚Äù or description of the observed or observable facts‚Äù (p. vii)

                - follow up #> ‚Äúthe construction of a new theory is far from being reducible to the accumulation of data, but necessitates an extremely complex ^^structuring^^ of interpretive ideas which are ^^linked^^ to ^^the facts^^ and which enrich them by framing them in a ^^context^^‚Äù

        - The more things change, the more they stay the same: [[Zachary Lipton]] laments the lack of theory, and so do others (e.g., [[@jollyFlatlandFallacyMoving2019]], [[@vanrooijTheoryTestHow2020]] [[@alvessonGeneratingResearchQuestions2011]])

        - Could explain why [[[[CL]] - Science is getting less bang for its buck]]

- Possibly because #[[[[CLM]] - Effective synthesis is hard]] and also [rare]([[[[CLM]] - Effective synthesis is rare]]), since #[[[[CLM]] - Scientific fields stall without adequate theoretical synthesis]]

    - Our [[synthesis]] apparatus was probably ok for a world in which there was less to synthesize, and possibly less [[Scatter]]. But the world has changed (e.g., [[interdisciplinarity]] is way more of a thing, there is way more to synthesize now, way more [[Scatter]]), and our synthesis apparatus has hardly changed at all. So it's quite plausible that our effective synthesis rate would fall quite a bit behind where we need it to be.

    - It's hard to study the level of [[synthesis]] directly (and in particular draw a causal link between that and "progress", which is in itself really tricky to measure, since we rely a lot on scientometrics and bibliometrics, and [[[[CLM]] - Citation practices in science are far from optimal]]), but we have lots of anecdotal evidence at least.

- Several pieces and talks by [[Berna Devezer]] about the insufficiency of reproducibility for advancing discovery, also making the case for formal methods (possibly [[synthesis]]) - reminded me of the argument that [[[[CLM]] - Scientific fields stall without adequate theoretical synthesis]], even if reproducibility is maintained.

                - Abstract

                    - Consistent confirmations obtained independently of each other lend credibility to a scientific result. We refer to results satisfying this consistency as reproducible and assume that reproducibility is a desirable property of scientific discovery. Yet seemingly science also progresses despite irreproducible results, indicating that the relationship between reproducibility and other desirable properties of scientific discovery is not well understood. These properties include early discovery of truth, persistence on truth once it is discovered, and time spent on truth in a long-term scientific inquiry. We build a mathematical model of scientific discovery that presents a viable framework to study its desirable properties including reproducibility. In this framework, we assume that scientists adopt a model-centric approach to discover the true model generating data in a stochastic process of scientific discovery. We analyze the properties of this process using Markov chain theory, Monte Carlo methods, and agent-based modeling. We show that the scientific process may not converge to truth even if scientific results are reproducible and that irreproducible results do not necessarily imply untrue results. The proportion of different research strategies represented in the scientific population, scientists‚Äô choice of methodology, the complexity of truth, and the strength of signal contribute to this counter-intuitive finding. Important insights include that innovative research speeds up the discovery of scientific truth by facilitating the exploration of model space and epistemic diversity optimizes across desirable properties of scientific discovery.

                - Abstract

                    - This paper investigates the conceptual relationship between openness and reproducibility using a model-centric approach, heavily informed by probability theory and statistics. We first clarify the concepts of reliability, auditability, replicability, and reproducibility--each of which denotes a potential scientific objective. Then we advance a conceptual analysis to delineate the relationship between open scientific practices and these objectives. Using the notion of an idealized experiment, we identify which components of an experiment need to be reported and which need to be repeated to achieve the relevant objective. The model-centric framework we propose aims to contribute precision and clarity to the discussions surrounding the so-called reproducibility crisis.

                    - <h3>Abstract</h3> <p>Current attempts at methodological reform in sciences come in response to an overall lack of rigor in methodological and scientific practices in experimental sciences. However, some of these reform attempts suffer from the same mistakes and over-generalizations they purport to address. Considering the costs of allowing false claims to become canonized, we argue for more rigor and nuance in methodological reform. By way of example, we present a formal analysis of three common claims in the metascientific literature: (a) that reproducibility is the cornerstone of science; (b) that data must not be used twice in any analysis; and (c) that exploratory projects are characterized by poor statistical practice. We show that none of these three claims are correct in general and we explore when they do and do not hold.</p>

- example of need for [[synthesis]] / [[[[CLM]] - Scientific fields stall without adequate theoretical synthesis]], over contradictory, partial evidence, to find a better theory; case of scurvy

    - and also... cc [[Research Research Canvas]] - need to understand *why* the thing works, not just that it works, otherwise.... in some cases the actual solution may be lost for a long time!!! and the problem (and its harmful effects) will persist!!

        - > **A quality synthesis will clarify and resolve, rather than obscure inconsistencies or tensions between material synthesized.** Ideas from diverse sources need synthesizing because they are not initially consistent, commensurable, or do not clearly fit into a single framework. A synthesis which creates a common framework for initially diverse ideas should result in a clarification and resolution of the causes of such difficulties. It should not integrate material by obscuring the sense of the ideas, or by failing to note the distinctive role that particular concepts or ideas play in their initial conceptual frameworks. For example, we cannot synthesize differing views on the role of praise in learning by substituting the more neutral word praise for words such as reinforcement or feedback. This does not resolve the underlying conflict between behaviorist and cognitivist theories of motivation; it simply obscures them.

**A quality synthesis will result in a progressive problem shift.** Synthesis involves a conceptual innovation, as well as a reinterpretation of some of the ideas synthesized. Such a reinterpretation should be progressive and should increase our understanding of the materials synthesized. A progressive problem shift will exhibit such features as increased explanatory and predictive power and expanded empirical content, increased theoretical ability to explain ideas synthesized, expanded scope of application, and an increased capacity to identify and pursue unsolved problems.

**A successful synthesis will satisfy the formal criteria for good theories**. Such standards as consistency, parsimony, elegance, and fruitfulness characterize a good synthesis. (pp. 356-357)

    - why did 19th century sailors forget the simple cure for scurvy discovered in the 1700's (and millions needlessly died)??

[[January 11th, 2021]]

- Relatedly, beginning to connect the dots to say something more cogent about [[[[CLM]] - Scientific fields stall without adequate theoretical synthesis]]

    - We can draw a line from the early days with [[@newellYouCanPlay1973]], to the modern standard-bearers like [[Iris van Rooij]] ([new paper]([[@vanrooijTheoryTestHow2021]]) just came out to formalize and further develop the arguments from [[@rooijPsychologicalScienceNeeds2019]])

    - [[@vanrooijTheoryTestHow2021]] is a goldmine of quotes and sources for developing this argument further!

        - Here we have the same idea (using hte exact same language!) of a [[dialectic]]

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FI9QDiUe5zf.png?alt=media&token=6b23add6-1698-4ca7-9b31-05a4df940eae)

            - And also the explicit description of the problem that [[Z: Theories are grossly underdetermined by data]]

                - Which is a reason that [[[[CLM]] - Effective synthesis is hard]]: need more than just data

                - But also need lots of data! This is the idea of "background knowledge" (e.g., psychological plausibility constraints)

            - beautiful expression of this [[dialectic]] with the term "disciplined dreaming" (cf. [[disciplined imagination]])

                - https://twitter.com/neurograce/status/1348340222292062211

                - [[@marderTheoreticalMusings2020]] leads to wonderful rabbit-hole and find of this paper that does a "worked example" of how to better interleave theory and data in papers: [[@goldsteinAreTheoreticalResults2018]]

                    - and also reflecting on the aberrant emphasis on data > theory in bio

                        - maybe fits with stuff that [[Matthew Akamatsu]] has been saying about the undervaluing of [[synthesis]] in his field

                    - talks about the need for the [[dialectic]] [[dance between the theoretical and the evidential]] that is foundational to the scientific method

                        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FKSHeAWEx44.png?alt=media&token=e52c3dae-883b-42a4-89a3-1b5713432527)

    - Basically, the argument is:

        - [[Z: Theories are grossly underdetermined by data]] aka "you can't play twenty questions with nature and win" ([[@newellYouCanPlay1973]])

        - But we often forget this, with an overemphasis on "effects" [[@vanrooijTheoryTestHow2021]] or "letting the data speak for itself" [[@goldsteinAreTheoreticalResults2018]] (forgetting that [[Z: Observation is theory-laden]] too!). This results in a situation where [[[[CLM]] - Effective synthesis is rare]], not just on a theory level but also on a lit review level (a cogent synthesis guiding an experiment)

        - This is again probably an underrated reason that [[[[CL]] - Science is getting less bang for its buck]]

        - Thus, [[[[CLM]] - Scientific fields stall without adequate theoretical synthesis]]

        - [[@jonasCouldNeuroscientistUnderstand2017]] is a particularly fun thought experiment++ on the insufficiency of a purely data-driven approach. ((On the flip side, the "empirical turn" in philosophy is evidence of the insufficiency of a purely theory-driven approach))
