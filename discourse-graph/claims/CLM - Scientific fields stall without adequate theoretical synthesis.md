    - Description

        - This is in part because [[[[CLM]] - Synthesis is-necessary-for effective problem formulation]]

        - A #> I really like on this is from [[Allen Newell]] [[@newellYouCanPlay1973]]: #> "You can't play 20 questions with nature and win".

            - #> from [[Jean Piaget]] in preface to [[@gruberDarwinManPsychological1974]] #> : ‚Äúa new scientific theory differs from a simple ‚Äúreading‚Äù or description of the observed or observable facts‚Äù (p. vii)

                - follow up #> ‚Äúthe construction of a new theory is far from being reducible to the accumulation of data, but necessitates an extremely complex ^^structuring^^ of interpretive ideas which are ^^linked^^ to ^^the facts^^ and which enrich them by framing them in a ^^context^^‚Äù

        - The more things change, the more they stay the same: [[Zachary Lipton]] laments the lack of theory, and so do others (e.g., [[@jollyFlatlandFallacyMoving2019]], [[@vanrooijTheoryTestHow2020]] [[@alvessonGeneratingResearchQuestions2011]])

        - Could explain why [[[[CLM]] - Science is getting less bang for its buck]]
