    - Description

        - This is in part because [[CLM - Synthesis is-necessary-for effective problem formulation]]

        - A quoteI really like on this is from [[Allen Newell]]

            - quote from [[Jean Piaget]]

                - follow up > ‚Äúthe construction of a new theory is far from being reducible to the accumulation of data, but necessitates an extremely complex ^^structuring^^ of interpretive ideas which are ^^linked^^ to ^^the facts^^ and which enrich them by framing them in a ^^context^^‚Äù

        - The more things change, the more they stay the same: [[Zachary Lipton]]

        - Could explain why [[CLM - Science is getting less bang for its buck]]

    - Related to:

        - [[Z Theories are core examples of synthesis]]
