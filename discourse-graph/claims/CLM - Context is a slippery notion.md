    - R-Sources

        - [[context]] is... contextual? Hard to pin down. What counts as "context" for a person is very dependent on other contextual factors. Probably the same for information objects. (p.7) [[@agarwalExploringContextInformation2017]]

        - #> "It is not simply the case that something is or is not context; rather, it may or may not be contextually relevant to some particular activity." #context (p.22) [[@dourishWhatWeTalk2004]]

        - it can be quite hard to standardize (and therefore make efficient) expressions of [[context]] (e.g., in a dropdown menu of possible "contexts") [[@andersonDataBaseMent2008]]
