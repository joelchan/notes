    - Description:

        - Philosophical accounts of synthesis in science emphasize that it is a form of [[argumentation]], which operates on statements and concepts as fundamental units

        - [[@harsDesigningScientificKnowledge2001]] synthesized four major objectivist epistemological models of scientific knowledge from [[Philosophy of Science]], including Popper [[@popperLogicScientificDiscovery1959]], Nagel [[@nagelStructureScienceProblems1979]], Dubin [[@dubinTheoryBuilding1978]], and Bunge [[@bungePhilosophyScience1998]], and demonstrated that they all model argumentation in terms of scientists building systems of scientific statements, which are composed of relationships between concepts.

        - We see this also in the way that [[[[CLM]] - Scientists read strategically, not linearly]] specifically for these components. This might be an artifact of the current structure of the [[[[scholarly communication]] [[infrastructure]]]] though, since [[[[CLM]] - Most scholarly communication infrastructure operates on the document as the base unit]]

        - Note: we need to work out whether [[Interpretivist]] epistemologies will have different implications; my initial instinct is no; the structure won't change that much (although [[context]] might become far more important)

    - A number of prominent models of alt. scholarly comm infrastructures for search and (sometimes machine, but also human) sensemaking of scholarly argumentation

        - Overall vision is well cast by [[@deWaardProteinsFairytalesDirections2010]] and [[@liddoContestedCollectiveIntelligence2012]] to emphasize that we need discourse, not just knowledge graphs, but definitely not just papers!

            - [[std/SEPIO]] for assertions and evidence [[@brushSEPIOSemanticModel2016]]

    - [[@harsDesigningScientificKnowledge2001]] articulates some good {{alias: [[example-of]] examples of}} the kinds of queries that are both crucial for [[synthesis]] and functionally impossible to answer in our current scholarly communication infrastructure, such as "What are unsolved problems in domain X? What solutions have been proposed for problem X? What extensions have been proposed? What theories incorporate concept X? What are alternative interpretations of concept X"?

- Granular representation of scientific ideas at the claim level [matches the kinds of queries that you would want to ask of an evidence collection during synthesis]([[[[CLM]] - Scholarly argumentation operates on atomic statements and concepts as fundamental units]]), and exploration is enhanced through the networked structure.

    - This network structure is worth reemphasizing, since keyword-based search often fails when crossing knowledge boundaries: you often don't know what terms are relevant or the most fitting for search. Even when crossing relatively near knowledge boundaries, there can be idiosyncratic differences in the exact terms used. In these instances, network-based foraging through associative trails is superior to keyword search.
