    - Description

        - [[CLM - Synthesis is creating a new whole out of component parts]]

        - One important dimension of conceptual building blocks for synthesis is "**size**".

        - Intuitively, having building blocks that are too "large" or complex would make reassembly into a new whole impractical or impossible. Thus, the most basic requirement for [[synthesis]]

        - There are a few ways to think about size and why it matters for [[synthesis]]

            - [[CLM - Compressing complex ideas into more manageable chunks facilitates more complex thought]]

            - A simple benefit is just making it easier to find what you're actually looking for! For example, [[@ribaupierreExtractingDiscourseElements2017]]

            - __decomposing__ ideas into smaller pieces also enables us to **connect ideas in richer and more meaningful ways**. For example, we learn from creativity theory that [[CLM - Representing ideas in atomic units facilitates conceptual combination]]

        - It is important to distinguish [[Atomicity]]

            - We see this chiefly from the literature on [[Insight problem solving]]

            - A related idea is that [[CLM - Ideas develop simultaneously at multiple timescales, levels of granularity, and completeness]]

        - We might wonder: if we break complex documents down in a [[synthesis]]

            - One answer to this is that [[CL - Scholarly synthesis is argumentation]]

            - This should be nuanced, though, because restricting ourselves to only linguistic / [[symbolic]]

                - See, for example, [[prototypes]]

                - Even [[@mccrickardMakingClaimsKnowledge2012]]

            - We also may not want to "reduce" ideas to a single representation, since [[CLM - Multiplicity is necessary for synthesis]]

        - Unfortunately, [[CLM - Most scholarly communication infrastructure operates on the document as the base unit]]

            - This is important, because, like [[Insight problem solving]]

                - Scholars encounter a problem with "chunks" (papers, sources, etc.), either ones they have already, or ones they seek out.

                - They want to construct a new understanding. To do that, they need to decompose the chunk of the paper/source/chapter, etc. into the component parts they care about, to be able to manipulate them, combine them, move them around, etc. (cf. [[CLM - Scholarly argumentation operates on atomic statements and concepts as fundamental units]]

                - The source of difficulty for chunk decomposition in this case isn't necessarily the fact that the chunks are "tight" in the specific sense that Knoblich meant: that is, the components of the chunk *are* meaningful. It's just that the scholar has to "chisel" them out of the paper. It takes work!

                - But the point remains that having access to the chunks is important!

        - :hiccup [:hr]

        - Another possible dimension is "**separateness**" from other pieces of information. This might be related to the emerging idea of [[Multiplicity]]
