    - Description

        - [[[[CLM]] - Synthesis is creating a new whole out of component parts]]. But what should the "parts" look like? What kinds of building blocks would facilitate [[synthesis]]?

        - One important dimension of conceptual building blocks for synthesis is "**size**".

        - Intuitively, having building blocks that are too "large" or complex would make reassembly into a new whole impractical or impossible. Thus, the most basic requirement for [[synthesis]] is having appropriate(ly sized) building blocks to start with.

        - There are a few ways to think about size and why it matters for [[synthesis]].

            - [[[[CLM]] - Compressing complex ideas into more manageable chunks facilitates more complex thought]].

            - A simple benefit is just making it easier to find what you're actually looking for! For example, [[@ribaupierreExtractingDiscourseElements2017]] found that [scientists](((U5aWHKxu9))) who [compared](((I_uXzCuyy))) an [enhanced faceted search engine](((5OAeQgh2B))) (with ability to search a large corpus of articles by discourse elements) to a regular keyword search system in terms of efficacy for various [targeted search tasks](((6HYDEe9e3))), [self-reported](((pDK5Rlynx))) a significantly higher signal-to-noise ratio in results with the faceted search system compared to the keyword search system

            - __decomposing__ ideas into smaller pieces also enables us to **connect ideas in richer and more meaningful ways**. For example, we learn from creativity theory that [[Z: Representing ideas in atomic units facilitates conceptual combination]]. This is because [[Z: Synthesis is a creative act]], and [[[[CLM]] - Conceptual combination is-fundamental-to creative knowledge production]].

        - It is important to distinguish [[Atomicity]] from [[compression]]: in creative thought, it is less about [[Decomposition]] in the atomic and disconnected sense, and more about flexibly using [[compression]] to move between different levels and states of "granularity".

            - We see this chiefly from the literature on [[Insight problem solving]], which informs us that [[[[CLM]] - Breaking ideas down into component parts facilitates creative reinterpretation]].

            - A related idea is that [[[[CLM]] - Ideas develop simultaneously at multiple timescales, levels of granularity, and completeness]]

        - We might wonder: if we break complex documents down in a [[synthesis]] [[infrastructure]], what should the component parts look like? What defines an "idea" level, or an appropriately "small" building block for scholarly [[synthesis]]?

            - One answer to this is that [[[[CL]] - Scholarly synthesis is argumentation]] and [[[[CLM]] - Scholarly argumentation operates on atomic statements and concepts as fundamental units]].

            - This should be nuanced, though, because restricting ourselves to only linguistic / [[symbolic]] representations would probably be a mistake. There are other forms of knowledge, visual and otherwise, that are important "units" that can't be reduced to their "underlying" linguistic representation.

                - See, for example, [[prototypes]] [[@galeyHowPrototypeArgues2010]], or [[strong concepts]] [[@hookStrongConceptsIntermediatelevel2012]]

                - Even [[@mccrickardMakingClaimsKnowledge2012]]'s idea of [[standard/Claims]]

            - We also may not want to "reduce" ideas to a single representation, since [[[[CL]] - Multiplicity is necessary for synthesis]]

        - Unfortunately, [[[[CLM]] - Most scholarly communication infrastructure operates on the document as the base unit]]

            - This is important, because, like [[Insight problem solving]], if [[chunk decomposition]] is harder, then the task of [[synthesis]] gets harder.

                - Scholars encounter a problem with "chunks" (papers, sources, etc.), either ones they have already, or ones they seek out.

                - They want to construct a new understanding. To do that, they need to decompose the chunk of the paper/source/chapter, etc. into the component parts they care about, to be able to manipulate them, combine them, move them around, etc. (cf. [[[[CLM]] - Scholarly argumentation operates on atomic statements and concepts as fundamental units]])

                - The source of difficulty for chunk decomposition in this case isn't necessarily the fact that the chunks are "tight" in the specific sense that Knoblich meant: that is, the components of the chunk *are* meaningful. It's just that the scholar has to "chisel" them out of the paper. It takes work!

                - But the point remains that having access to the chunks is important!

        - :hiccup [:hr]

        - Another possible dimension is "**separateness**" from other pieces of information. This might be related to the emerging idea of [[Multiplicity]]

    - Synthesizers should be able to ^^work at the "idea level"^^, not the document level. Ideas = "statements", "concepts", "relations".

    - Third, if ideas are available in "unchunked" form, they are also easier to externalize in a system, which can help overcome cognitive limitations of memory. In other words, #[[[[CLM]] - Compressing complex ideas into more manageable chunks facilitates more complex thought]]

        - For example...

    - First, an effective synthesis will likely require a __novel__ (re)interpretation of facts. This new understanding shouldn't be constrained by how ideas were "chunked" (e.g., into documents) in prior work. We see this chiefly from the literature on [[Insight problem solving]], which informs us that [[[[CLM]] - Breaking ideas down into component parts facilitates creative reinterpretation]]. If ideas are more available in their "unchunked" form, synthesizers don't have to do as much work to find and recombine the ideas in novel ways.

        - For example... we see in Darwin's notebook a ton of notes about facts, and also statements. They do run together, but you can see that they repeat over time in ways that are separate from their original context.

        - Importantly, ~40% of the pages in [[Darwin's notebooks]] are excised

    - Why is this important for synthesis?

    - Second (and related to the first point), we can think of "shrinking" ideas as a way to #[[Z: Increase the surface area for ideas]]. __decomposing__ ideas into smaller pieces also enables us to **connect ideas in richer and more meaningful ways**. For example, we learn from creativity theory that [[Z: Representing ideas in atomic units facilitates conceptual combination]]. This is because [[Z: Synthesis is a creative act]], and [[[[CLM]] - Conceptual combination is-fundamental-to creative knowledge production]].

        - It is important to distinguish [[Atomicity]] from [[compression]]: in creative thought, it is less about [[Decomposition]] in the atomic and disconnected sense, and more about flexibly using [[compression]] to move between different levels and states of "granularity".

            - [[Atomicity]] isn't just about breaking things down. It's also about [[compression]]. We "shrink" and "chunk" things so we can think bigger thoughts. This is important to keep in mind. I keep going back and forth between the two terms, but they are far from synonymous. They describe a syndrome of affordances around a common surface feature of "smallness". But choosing one or the other might risk losing essential aspects of the requirement.

- Need to be clear about what we mean by [[Atomicity]] for [[[[CLM]] - Compression is necessary for synthesis]]: breaking it down to the "concept" level (e.g., a tag, or keyword) is technically a kind of atomicity, but it's... too granular to be useful. The connections explode. I don't think we need to do away with them, but we need higher level blocks, but lower level than a whole document/paper. Right now we only have keywords and papers, and no [[infrastructure]] focused on that intermediate layer (I mean, we have standards, but not enough uptake for this to count as infrastructure).

    - It's almost like the [[Basic Level of Categories]] that strikes some optimal balance between generality and specificity, from an information-theoretic perspective.

- Granular: [[[[CLM]] - Compression is necessary for synthesis]]

    - Philosophical and information models of scientific discourse emphasize that thinking happens over information units that are more granular than a paper: instead, units like questions, claims, evidence, and concepts are the primary units that are evaluated, composed, and recombined into novel theories and hypotheses [[@harsDesigningScientificKnowledge2001]] [[@ribaupierreExtractingDiscourseElements2017]] [[@clarkMicropublicationsSemanticModel2014]] [[@shumModelingNaturalisticArgumentation2006]].

    - This is related to research on expertise and creative problem solving, which finds that breaking complex ideas down into more meaningful, smaller conceptual "chunks" may be necessary for creative recombination into new conceptual wholes [[@mccrickardAchievingBothCreativity2013]], [[@chaseMindEyeChess1973]], [[@knoblichConstraintRelaxationChunk1999]], [[@mccaffreyInnovationReliesObscure2012]]

- the **units **need to be [compress(able)]([[[[CLM]] - Compression is necessary for synthesis]]) and [contextualizable]([[[[CLM]] - Contextualizability is necessary for synthesis]]).

    - this is a variation and expansion of the argument we make in [[@qianITunesPapersRedefining2019a]]

    - this is the proper target of the [[Grant proposal for Synthesis Infrastructure - NSF CHS / SOS 2020]]

    - and these together are probably sufficient for making substantial gains towards much better [[collective intelligence]] and a [[peer-to-peer]] [[infrastructure]] for [[synthesis]]
