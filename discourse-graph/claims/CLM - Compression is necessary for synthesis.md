    - Description

        - [[[[CLM]] - Synthesis is creating a new whole out of component parts]]. But what should the "parts" look like? What kinds of building blocks would facilitate [[synthesis]]?

        - One important dimension of conceptual building blocks for synthesis is "**size**".

        - Intuitively, having building blocks that are too "large" or complex would make reassembly into a new whole impractical or impossible. Thus, the most basic requirement for [[synthesis]] is having appropriate(ly sized) building blocks to start with.

        - There are a few ways to think about size and why it matters for [[synthesis]].

            - [[[[CLM]] - Compressing complex ideas into more manageable chunks facilitates more complex thought]].

            - A simple benefit is just making it easier to find what you're actually looking for! For example, [[@ribaupierreExtractingDiscourseElements2017]] found that [scientists](((U5aWHKxu9))) who [compared](((I_uXzCuyy))) an [enhanced faceted search engine](((5OAeQgh2B))) (with ability to search a large corpus of articles by discourse elements) to a regular keyword search system in terms of efficacy for various [targeted search tasks](((6HYDEe9e3))), [self-reported](((pDK5Rlynx))) a significantly higher signal-to-noise ratio in results with the faceted search system compared to the keyword search system

            - __decomposing__ ideas into smaller pieces also enables us to **connect ideas in richer and more meaningful ways**. For example, we learn from creativity theory that [[Z: Representing ideas in atomic units facilitates conceptual combination]]. This is because [[Z: Synthesis is a creative act]], and [[[[CLM]] - Conceptual combination is-fundamental-to creative knowledge production]].

        - It is important to distinguish [[Atomicity]] from [[compression]]: in creative thought, it is less about [[Decomposition]] in the atomic and disconnected sense, and more about flexibly using [[compression]] to move between different levels and states of "granularity".

            - We see this chiefly from the literature on [[Insight problem solving]], which informs us that [[[[CLM]] - Breaking ideas down into component parts facilitates creative reinterpretation]].

            - A related idea is that [[[[CLM]] - Ideas develop simultaneously at multiple timescales, levels of granularity, and completeness]]

        - We might wonder: if we break complex documents down in a [[synthesis]] [[infrastructure]], what should the component parts look like? What defines an "idea" level, or an appropriately "small" building block for scholarly [[synthesis]]?

            - One answer to this is that [[[[CL]] - Scholarly synthesis is argumentation]] and [[[[CLM]] - Scholarly argumentation operates on atomic statements and concepts as fundamental units]].

            - This should be nuanced, though, because restricting ourselves to only linguistic / [[symbolic]] representations would probably be a mistake. There are other forms of knowledge, visual and otherwise, that are important "units" that can't be reduced to their "underlying" linguistic representation.

                - See, for example, [[prototypes]] [[@galeyHowPrototypeArgues2010]], or [[strong concepts]] [[@hookStrongConceptsIntermediatelevel2012]]

                - Even [[@mccrickardMakingClaimsKnowledge2012]]'s idea of [[standard/Claims]]

            - We also may not want to "reduce" ideas to a single representation, since [[[[CLM]] - Multiplicity is necessary for synthesis]]

        - Unfortunately, [[[[CLM]] - Most scholarly communication infrastructure operates on the document as the base unit]]

            - This is important, because, like [[Insight problem solving]], if [[chunk decomposition]] is harder, then the task of [[synthesis]] gets harder.

                - Scholars encounter a problem with "chunks" (papers, sources, etc.), either ones they have already, or ones they seek out.

                - They want to construct a new understanding. To do that, they need to decompose the chunk of the paper/source/chapter, etc. into the component parts they care about, to be able to manipulate them, combine them, move them around, etc. (cf. [[[[CLM]] - Scholarly argumentation operates on atomic statements and concepts as fundamental units]])

                - The source of difficulty for chunk decomposition in this case isn't necessarily the fact that the chunks are "tight" in the specific sense that Knoblich meant: that is, the components of the chunk *are* meaningful. It's just that the scholar has to "chisel" them out of the paper. It takes work!

                - But the point remains that having access to the chunks is important!

        - :hiccup [:hr]

        - Another possible dimension is "**separateness**" from other pieces of information. This might be related to the emerging idea of [[Multiplicity]]
