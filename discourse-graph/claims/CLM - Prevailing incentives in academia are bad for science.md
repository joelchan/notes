    - Description:

        - [[[[CLM]] - Prestige substantially controls how scientific ideas spread]]

        - Current [[incentives]] bias favor [[short-termism]]

            - For example, [[[[CL]] - Scientists prefer to pursue safer incremental advances rather than risky breakthroughs]]

            - This is bad for science because [[[[CLM]] - True creative breakthroughs often take a long time to develop]]

        - [[[[CLM]] - Scientific peer review is deeply flawed]]

        - [[[[CLM]] - Citation practices in science are far from optimal]]

        - [[[[CLM]] - Error detection work in science is systematically undervalued]]

        - [[[[CLM]] - bibliometric measures are biased against novel breakthrough research - [[@wangBiasNoveltyScience2017]]]]

        - [[@smaldinoNaturalSelectionBad2016]]

            - In a similar fashion to what is seen in empirical observations of scientific practice, selecting for high output in [the model](((DRG86XRFt))) led to the proliferation of poorer methods, such as low statistical power, and increasingly high false discovery rates

            - Discusses (mostly from personal experience) the issues with a conference-driven publication culture, including deadline-driven, [[least-publishable unit]] stuff, possibly [[short-termism]] too

        - [[@johnMeasuringPrevalenceQuestionable2012]]

            - Approximately 50% of psychologists have engaged in [[Questionable Research Practices]] (short of falsifying data) at least once (p. 527)

            - [[SOTA]] from old models are actually not really improved upon that much

        - [[@dedeoWhenScienceGame2020]]

            - science can be a "game", which helps produce behaviors such as failing to prosecute [[Questionable Research Practices]] and barriers to open science or [[semantic publishing]]

- Brain is really really full after reading [this post](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/science-policy-and-infrastructure) by [[Open Philanthrophy]] about science policy and infrastructure (h/t [[Evan Miyazono]]), and connecting it to the [[org/Protocol Labs]] roadmapping project for metascience: so many roads seem to run through the *system* as a core issue (e.g., [[[[CLM]] - Prevailing incentives in academia are bad for science]]) - ^^**the biggest, most transformative advance might be at the level of creating a flourishing ecosystem for amateur (in the positive, technical sense) science. **^^

    - There are already hints of this going on with [[citizen science]], and the growing ecosystem of "[[independent researchers]]" (see, e.g., [[Andy Matuschak]] and [[@thegeneralistIndieResearcher2020]] discussion amongst [indie researchers]([[independent researchers]]) like [[Andy Matuschak]] and [[Adam Wiggins]] (of [[org/Ink and Switch]], who made [[sys/Muse]]) that gives insight into the [problems with academic science and research]([[[[CLM]] - Prevailing incentives in academia are bad for science]]))

        - And now [[sys/Experiment]], with [[Cindy Wu]] et al

        - And of course [[org/Protocol Labs]] and [[org/Ought]] and many others

    - What if this "alt-academia" / independent research thing were the norm, and not the exception? Is that possible? #[[Question]] #idea [[[[QUE]] - How might we reimagine the way science is done at the whole system level?]]

        - It's possible that no path exists to a better ecosystem for science through the current system. But in any case, it would be highly transformative to construct a roadmap and focused effort to try to get there, whether it's through burning bridges and siphoning off the many people who have left academia because [[[[CLM]] - Prevailing incentives in academia are bad for science]] (e.g., Blogpost by [[James Heathers]] about leaving academia [[@heathersQuit2020]] )

        - A vision for this might also come from [[tools for conviviality]]: instead of thinking about constructing an industrialized system, envision a system that is convivial, that empowers each person with maximal freedom to contribute to the advancement of scientific knowledge.

    - A big motivation for me is how difficult it is to think through traction for adoption of [[metascience]] interventions.

        - Side note: it would be interesting to analyze the history of issues in science, such as reproducibility, focus on quantity over quality, [[@smaldinoNaturalSelectionBad2016]], etc.

    - I can articulate now one reason I'm fascinated with that scene: in some ways, their work represents research and the pursuit of insight in its purest form, unadulterated by careerism (how am I going to get more pubs, how am I going to get promoted, get more grants, rewards, etc.), because they're not in a system that links their work to those incentives. That is how it should be in academia, but my experience is that I'm swimming **against** these currents to do the work I feel needs to be done.

    - [AI Research, Replicability and Incentives](https://dennybritz.com/blog/ai-replication-incentives/) [[@britzAIResearchReplicability2020]]

        - One would think that implementing the same model in two different frameworks would lead to identical results. But that's not the case. Subtle differences in ^^framework implementations, insufficient documentation, hidden hyperparameters, and bugs^^ can cascade and lead to different outcomes. If you go through the Github issues and forums of popular Deep Learning frameworks, you can find many examples of researchers obtaining unexpected results (like [here](https://l7.curtisnorthcutt.com/towards-reproducibility-benchmarking-keras-pytorch) or [here](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/pull/9965) or [here](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/4444) or [here](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/8672) or [here](https://github.com/kuangliu/pytorch-cifar/issues/45) or [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/MMdnn/issues/595)). From what I have seen, high-level frameworks like Keras that hide low-level implementation details and come with implicit hyperparameter choices already made for you, are the most common source of confusion.

[[June 14th, 2020]]

- New fact relevant to [[[[CLM]] - Prevailing incentives in academia are bad for science]]: there has long been an "inside track" to publishing in [[PNAS]] that sidesteps the regular [[peer review]] process.

    - This paper documents it: https://www.nature.com/news/scientific-publishing-the-inside-track-1.15424 - nuanced by the fact that most people don't use it, and it's used heavily by only a small number of people. But importantly, the mechanism was used and justified because there was a sense that [[[[CLM]] - Scientific peer review is deeply flawed]]

        - [Scientific publishing: The inside track](https://www.nature.com/news/scientific-publishing-the-inside-track-1.15424)

            - #quotes

                - These scientists say that the main motivator for using the contributed track is an intense frustration with the peer-review process at other high-profile journals, which they argue has become excessive and laborious

                - Complaints about nitpicking reviews at Nature and Science go hand-in-hand with the charge that the editors at these journals are in thrall to trendy areas of research. “Very often what seems to be fashionable is not very good science,” says Croce.

- major reiteration of the theme about [incentives]([[[[CLM]] - Prevailing incentives in academia are bad for science]]), and connecting that to our collective failure to anticipate harms (h/t [[Aniket Kittur]]): we just don't incentivize enough the kind of work that could uncover and deal with these harms (not enough scale, not enough real users and fidelity of systems to be used with enough reality to uncover bad uses, harms, etc.)

        - Possible barrier: we haven't figured out good ways to measure the "returns" on research that are as informative as financial returns. But is this an intractable problem? Are parts of it tractable?

        - Possible barrier: the quant model doesn't fit. Research investment isn't that kind of thing, even though it looks similar (risks, etc.). But could the model be adapted to overcome misfits to still be useful?
