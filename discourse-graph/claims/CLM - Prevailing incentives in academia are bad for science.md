    - Description:

        - [[CLM - Prestige substantially controls how scientific ideas spread]]

        - Current [[incentives]]

            - For example, [[CLM - Scientists prefer to pursue safer incremental advances rather than risky breakthroughs]]

            - This is bad for science because [[CLM - True creative breakthroughs often take a long time to develop]]

        - [[CLM - Scientific peer review is deeply flawed]]

        - [[CLM - Citation practices in science are far from optimal]]

        - [[CLM - Error detection work in science is systematically undervalued]]

        - [[CLM - bibliometric measures are biased against novel breakthrough research - @wangBiasNoveltyScience2017]]

            - science can be a "game", which helps produce behaviors such as failing to prosecute [[Questionable Research Practices]]
