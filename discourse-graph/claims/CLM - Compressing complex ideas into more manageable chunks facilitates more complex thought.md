    - Description

        - [[@mccrickardMakingClaimsKnowledge2012]] talks about the idea of being able to rapidly explore connections between many ideas as an important precondition for creatively reusing prior knowledge. This gets hard when the idea units are too large to comprehend quickly ([linEmployingPatternsLayers2008](some users struggled to understand large design patterns #[[üìù lit-notes]] #Atomicity #[[context]]ualizability (p. 1321)))

        - In studies of human [[expertise]], we find that [[Chunking]] in memory is a major enabler of expert thinking [[@chaseMindEyeChess1973]]: experts are able to think "bigger", more complex thoughts by compressing complex ideas into memory chunks to overcome the limitations of working memory (+/- 4 [[@cowanMagicalNumberShortterm2000]], which we previously thought was 7)

        - Of course, a much more powerful way to extend thinking space is to leverage [[distributed cognition]] and [[externalization]]. But even then you still run into the limitations of your visual field and the physical area.

        - One metaphor for this is the idea of [[C: Compression]]

        - This "shrinking" is often accomplished by [[abstraction]]. While powerful, abstraction can impede synthesis if [[context]] isn't easy to recover (i.e., if the compression is "lossy"), because [[[[CL]] - Compression and contextualizability are in tension]], and [[[[CLM]] - Contextualizability is necessary for synthesis]]

- Third, if ideas are available in "unchunked" form, they are also easier to externalize in a system, which can help overcome cognitive limitations of memory. In other words, #[[[[CLM]] - Compressing complex ideas into more manageable chunks facilitates more complex thought]]

    - __decomposing__ ideas into smaller pieces also enables us to **connect ideas in richer and more meaningful ways**. For example, we learn from creativity theory that [[Z: Representing ideas in atomic units facilitates conceptual combination]]. This is because [[Z: Synthesis is a creative act]], and [[[[CLM]] - Conceptual combination is-fundamental-to creative knowledge production]].

    - It is important to distinguish [[Atomicity]] from [[compression]]: in creative thought, it is less about [[Decomposition]] in the atomic and disconnected sense, and more about flexibly using [[compression]] to move between different levels and states of "granularity".

        - [[Atomicity]] isn't just about breaking things down. It's also about [[compression]]. We "shrink" and "chunk" things so we can think bigger thoughts. This is important to keep in mind. I keep going back and forth between the two terms, but they are far from synonymous. They describe a syndrome of affordances around a common surface feature of "smallness". But choosing one or the other might risk losing essential aspects of the requirement.
