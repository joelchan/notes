    - Description

        - Something brewing in my brain, connecting back to that convo with [[Benjamin Reinhardt]] where he noted [[Andy Matuschak]] and [[Michael Nielsen]]'s conjecture that significant insights can/have only come from a "single mind". This might be a connection back to [[ðŸ§± interdisciplinary research modes]], and knowledge requirements for that, and why [[SRS]] might be a fascinating paradigm for understanding how we might supercharge creativity (e.g., [[ðŸ§± conceptual combination]]) by making more conceptual building blocks available for recombination in a single mind.

        - I do wonder if this effect of ideas intermingling over time at various levels of specificity can be approximated by being collocated and engaging in various "watercooler" and hallway [[Informal]] discussions

        - Seeing lots of papers on obvious application of [[SRS]] to fact-based learning like medical vocab and language learning, but not seen anything yet making the connection to downstream creative work, particularly [[interdisciplinarity]]
