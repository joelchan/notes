        - [[[[EVD]] - When provided scaffolding for a similar problem students performed similarly compared to their peers given little scaffolding, however, when asked to solve problems with low similarity the group provided scaffolding performed significantly better. - [[@richlandReducingCognitiveLoad2013]]]]

        - [[[[EVD]] - teachers in countries with high math and science achievement scores also displayed more cognitive supports for analogies, such as bridging analogies, and visuospatial scaffolds for comparison, compared to teachers in a country with lower math and science achievement - [[@richlandCognitiveSupportsAnalogies2007]]]]

        - [[[[EVD]] - giving a bridging analogy to a far analogy for a numerical representations led to better student performance (and more robust explanations of answers) on a math post test compared to no or just the analogy - [[@vamvakoussiBridgingGapDense2012]]]]
