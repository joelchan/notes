    - Description:

        - In most models of the creative process, [[[[CLM]] - Effective problem formulation is-necessary-for creative knowledge work]].

            - We focus only on problematizing assumptions
that underlie existing literature as a way to construct research questions: problematization challenges existing theories to develop more interesting and influential theories [[R: Alvesson2011]]/[[@alvessonGeneratingResearchQuestions2011]]

                - [[R: Sandberg2011]] is another Alvesson work that also applies, e.g. "Ways of constructing research questions: gap-spotting or problematization?" in 2010

            - Maybe the book of [[R: Campbell1982]]

            - [[[[CLM]] - Effective problem formulation is-necessary-for creative knowledge work]]

        - In the majority of cases, an effective [[synthesis]] of the problem domain is what enables a good [[problem (re)formulation]]. Without such a synthesis, creators cannot adequately transform their [[Ill-structured problem]] into a tractable one they can make progress on.

            - Synthesize coherence to construct gap [[R: Locke1997]]

            - In the language of [[Herbert Simon]], a deep engagement with the problem domain (including prior unsuccessful attempts to solve the problem, as well as related efforts from other problems/domains) is fundamental for clearly understanding the goal state, their current [undesirable] state, and what "moves" might be able to transform their current state into the goal state) [[R: newellHumanProblemSolving1972]] [[@simonStructureIllStructured1973]]

                - The house designing metaphor in [[@simonStructureIllStructured1973]], maybe alsoÂ the combining of multiple discrete tasks into unified task formulation

            - A good #example-of this is Simon's study of insight problem solving on the mutilated checkerboard problem [[@kaplanSearchInsight1990]], where noticing invariants in prior unsuccessful solution attempts was crucial for reformulating the insight problem, thereby making it soluble.

        - Participants experienced insight after noticing that parity is important to the problem representation (solution followed quickly after) (p. 388) [[@kaplanSearchInsight1990]]
