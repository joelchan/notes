    - Description:

        - In most models of the creative process, [[CLM - Effective problem formulation is-necessary-for creative knowledge work]]

            - We focus only on problematizing assumptions
that underlie existing literature as a way to construct research questions: problematization challenges existing theories to develop more interesting and influential theories [[R Alvesson2011]]

                - [[R Sandberg2011]]

            - Maybe the book of [[R Campbell1982]]

            - [[CLM - Effective problem formulation is-necessary-for creative knowledge work]]

        - In the majority of cases, an effective [[synthesis]]

            - Synthesize coherence to construct gap [[R Locke1997]]

            - In the language of [[Herbert Simon]]

                - The house designing metaphor in [[@simonStructureIllStructured1973]]

            - A good #example-of this is Simon's study of insight problem solving on the mutilated checkerboard problem [[@kaplanSearchInsight1990]]

    - R-Sources:

        - [[@simonStructureIllStructured1973]]

        - Participants experienced insight after noticing that parity is important to the problem representation (solution followed quickly after) (p. 388) [[@kaplanSearchInsight1990]]
