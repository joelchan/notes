    - Description

        - [[interdisciplinarity]] is hard because of [[Scatter]] ([[@moteReasonsVariationInformation1962]]

            - Ah! As I suspected: some are arguing ([[@bates1996learning]]; [[@palmerAligningStudiesInformation1999]]) that [[interdisciplinarity]] influences scholars' information practices. SHould dig into that to get into what they're really saying about __how__ precisely the practices are impacted by degree of [[interdisciplinarity]]

            - [[@bates1996learning]] claims [[interdisciplinarity]] typically characterized by high degree of [[Scatter]]

###### Discourse Context

- **Informs::** [[CLM - In interdisciplinary domains, network-based foraging is more powerful than search-based foraging]]
- **Informed By::** [[@moteReasonsVariationInformation1962]]
