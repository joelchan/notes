    - Description

        - for designers, can't assume they will keep the problem space "fixed": mutating hte problem space is in a way the "essence" of design [[@dorstCoreDesignThinking2011]]

        - see also [[problem (re)formulation]], although there is a fair amount of argument in design research that the way this happens with designers is fundamentally different in flavor, in that [[[[CLM]] - Expert designers are solution-oriented]]: (much more "jump in", iterative) than a "scientific" approach (although it is debatable whether the scientific approach being contrasted with is a "strawman") - one early #canonical paper for this is [[@lawsonCognitiveStrategiesArchitectural1979]] (cited in [[@crossExpertiseDesignOverview2004]])

            - [[@crossExpertiseDesignOverview2004]], though, summarizes that this experienced designers' solution-orientation is a function of experience with the problem type (possibly making it less ill-structured)

        - this is a big idea that started fairly early in design cognition research, probably around the early 2000's; #canonical paper is [[@dorstCreativityDesignProcess2001]]

            - here is what they observed in the study:

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FfVZskpJnHK.png?alt=media&token=3629d9f7-4483-494d-8145-0e9a1e53a713) (p. 434)

                - the partial structuring is quite reminiscent of what was observed by Okada et al with artists': [[[[EVD]] - Two artists used individual artworks to shape not just their ideas, but used a process of "analogical modification" to search for and modify higher-order concepts, and their creative vision. This process unfolded over the course of years. - [[@okadaAnalogicalModificationCreation2009]]]]

                - and also Helms et al's observation of how [[[[EVD]] - Engineering design students used multiple cross-domain analogies to fulfill design needs, and they could use analogies to get inspiration of how to decompose the problem and find new analogies. - [[@helmsCompoundAnalogicalDesign2008]]]]

            - another important person is [[Mary Lou Maher]] (e.g., [[@maherCoevolutionComputationalCognitive2003]]), with some connections to [[m/Computational Model]]s of design exploration in terms of [[genetic algorithms]], although with no specific claim that this is how humans do it [[@maherFormalisingDesignExploration1996]])

            - [[@crossExpertiseDesignOverview2004]] also reviews a fair number of studies that provide more empirical demonstrations of this, including [[@goelStructureDesignProblem1992]] who found that the designers they studied returned to problem formulation activities throughout the design process, not just in the beginning of the process

        - this is realted to ideas of multiple space search by [[David Klahr]] and others [[@klahrDualSpaceSearch1988]], exending the core models by [[Herbert Simon]] and [[Allen Newell]] [[@newellHumanProblemSolving1972]] [[@newellElementsTheoryHuman1958]]

        - This relates also to ideas about [[Reflective Conversation with the Design Material]] [[@schonReflectivePractitionerHow1983]]

            - And more generally echoes the situated turn in cognitive science (e.g., [[@suchmanPlansSituatedActions1987]])

- One insight I want to make sure we write down is that problem reformulation isn't a task that happens in isolation. Instead there is co-evolution with "solution processes"; see, e.g., [[[[CLM]] - Design proceeds by co-evolution of problem and solution space]]

    - This implies that it is probably not only hard, but maybe even incoherent to try to do this task in isolation.

    - So one #[[âž° breadcrumbs]] here is to articulate a few coherent examples of problem formulation, ideally in real-world scenarios

        - Starting points:

- [[[[CLM]] - Design proceeds by co-evolution of problem and solution space]]

    - [[@goelStructureDesignProblem1992]] argues that design behavior arises as an adaptive response to the ill-structure nature of design problem spaces. This may explain a bias towards design moves and "solution-orientedness" in designers

- A serious limitation of [[sys/RoamResearch]] is the friction of moving to nonverbal / visual modalities of exploration. While [[[[CL]] - Visual thinking interfaces are tricky to get right]], most serious work probably has to move between verbal and nonverbal (less propositional?) modalities of representation: the holy grail is being able to move between the two (incidentally this is what [[sys/Liquid:Author]] can do, and is anticipated by the idea of [[[[PTN]] - representational talkback]] introduced in [[@yamamotoRepresentationalTalkbackApproach1998]]), and strongly related to this idea of [[Reflective Conversation with the Design Material]] and [co-evolution of design and problem space]( [[[[CLM]] - Design proceeds by co-evolution of problem and solution space]])

    - [[sys/RoamResearch]] does have some workarounds, like being able to paste in screenshots of sketches, and specifying diagrams (e.g., via [[sys/Mermaid diagrams]]) or tables from text, but the moving between isn't as fluid as I'd like, and the messy sketches in particular feel "inert" and unable to interact on equal terms with the rest of the content (e.g., can't add pages post-hoc, block ref, etc.)

        - maybe some kind of interaction overlay on top of pasted in screenshots could do the trick? or in-built "layers" (not very unlike layers in photoshop and most image editing software, and how on paper you only really have soft "mutability" via layering on top, and some with erasing)

    - Beyond the cognitive consequences of this interaction / modality limitation, the highly textual and nonvisual nature of this interface can be an unnecessary turnoff for many users who like visual interfaces

    - related: [[@suwaWhatArchitectsStudents1997]] and idea of [[constructive perception]] [[@suwaConstructivePerceptionMetacognitive2003]]
[[THE - interaction-oriented theory of creative inspiration from examples]]

- [[co-evolution of problem and solution space]]: [[[[CLM]] - Design proceeds by co-evolution of problem and solution space]]

    - this was a super influential theory from design theory, though it wasn't directed specifically at examples, it was about design moves, which are the same thing (they're just coming from somewhere else)
