    - Description

        - for designers, can't assume they will keep the problem space "fixed": mutating hte problem space is in a way the "essence" of design [[@dorstCoreDesignThinking2011]]

        - see also [[problem (re)formulation]]

            - [[@crossExpertiseDesignOverview2004]]

        - this is a big idea that started fairly early in design cognition research, probably around the early 2000's; #canonical paper is [[@dorstCreativityDesignProcess2001]]

            - here is what they observed in the study:

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FfVZskpJnHK.png?alt=media&token=3629d9f7-4483-494d-8145-0e9a1e53a713) (p. 434)

                - the partial structuring is quite reminiscent of what was observed by Okada et al with artists': [[EVD - Two artists used individual artworks to shape not just their ideas, but used a process of ana...ion. This process unfolded over the course of years. - @okadaAnalogicalModificationCreation2009]]

                - and also Helms et al's observation of how [[EVD - Engineering design students used multiple cross-domain analogies to fulfill design needs, and...on of how to decompose the problem and find new analogies. - @helmsCompoundAnalogicalDesign2008]]

            - another important person is [[Mary Lou Maher]]

            - [[@crossExpertiseDesignOverview2004]]

        - this is realted to ideas of multiple space search by [[David Klahr]]

        - This relates also to ideas about [[Reflective Conversation with the Design Material]]

            - And more generally echoes the situated turn in cognitive science (e.g., [[@suchmanPlansSituatedActions1987]]
