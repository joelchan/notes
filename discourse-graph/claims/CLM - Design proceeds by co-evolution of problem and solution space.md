    - Description

        - for designers, can't assume they will keep the problem space "fixed": mutating hte problem space is in a way the "essence" of design [[@dorstCoreDesignThinking2011]]

        - see also [[problem (re)formulation]], although there is a fair amount of argument in design research that the way this happens with designers is fundamentally different in flavor, in that [[[[CLM]] - Expert designers are solution-oriented]]: (much more "jump in", iterative) than a "scientific" approach (although it is debatable whether the scientific approach being contrasted with is a "strawman") - one early #canonical paper for this is [[@lawsonCognitiveStrategiesArchitectural1979]] (cited in [[@crossExpertiseDesignOverview2004]])

            - [[@crossExpertiseDesignOverview2004]], though, summarizes that this experienced designers' solution-orientation is a function of experience with the problem type (possibly making it less ill-structured)

        - this is a big idea that started fairly early in design cognition research, probably around the early 2000's; #canonical paper is [[@dorstCreativityDesignProcess2001]]

            - here is what they observed in the study:

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FfVZskpJnHK.png?alt=media&token=3629d9f7-4483-494d-8145-0e9a1e53a713) (p. 434)

                - the partial structuring is quite reminiscent of what was observed by Okada et al with artists': [[[[EVD]] - Two artists used individual artworks to shape not just their ideas, but used a process of "analogical modification" to search for and modify higher-order concepts, and their creative vision. This process unfolded over the course of years. - [[@okadaAnalogicalModificationCreation2009]]]]

                - and also Helms et al's observation of how [[[[EVD]] - Engineering design students used multiple cross-domain analogies to fulfill design needs, and they could use analogies to get inspiration of how to decompose the problem and find new analogies. - [[@helmsCompoundAnalogicalDesign2008]]]]

            - another important person is [[Mary Lou Maher]] (e.g., [[@maherCoevolutionComputationalCognitive2003]]), with some connections to [[m/Computational Model]]s of design exploration in terms of [[genetic algorithms]], although with no specific claim that this is how humans do it [[@maherFormalisingDesignExploration1996]])

            - [[@crossExpertiseDesignOverview2004]] also reviews a fair number of studies that provide more empirical demonstrations of this, including [[@goelStructureDesignProblem1992]] who found that the designers they studied returned to problem formulation activities throughout the design process, not just in the beginning of the process

        - this is realted to ideas of multiple space search by [[David Klahr]] and others [[@klahrDualSpaceSearch1988]], exending the core models by [[Herbert Simon]] and [[Allen Newell]] [[@newellHumanProblemSolving1972]] [[@newellElementsTheoryHuman1958]]

        - This relates also to ideas about [[Reflective Conversation with the Design Material]] [[@schonReflectivePractitionerHow1983]]

            - And more generally echoes the situated turn in cognitive science (e.g., [[@suchmanPlansSituatedActions1987]])
