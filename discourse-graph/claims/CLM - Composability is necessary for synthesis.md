    - Description

        - Basic intuition: [[CLM - Synthesis is creating a new whole out of component parts]]

        - There are levels of compositionality

            - #Claim Some types of [[synthesis]]

            - Assemblage / quasi-synthesis

                - Weighing the bulk of the evidence (aka meta-analysis / [[systematic review]]

                - #Thought-Fragment Additionally, the [[IVEO Matrix]]

            - Levels of composability (cf. [[CLM - People process complex information in multiple levels and stages of processing]]

                - Bare minimum: can "affinity" group things

                    - Collections and tags can __kind of__ do this; but the upper limit on [[synthesis]]

                - Better: can connect things

                - Even better: can formalize things, typed relationships (e.g., contradiction, warrant, etc.)

                    - Cf. Principle #10: Save contradictory ideas

        - Synthesis is impaired in xyz way when we don't have sufficient compositionality

            - Classic example: affinity diagram?

            - Classic undifferentiated list, as noted in [[@holbrookLevelsSuccessUse2008]]

                - So, idea of "parts, not whole"? Assemblage? Can't transcend the sum of the parts. Or might not even have the sum.

                - The idea of a conceptually new whole construction is in contrast with what we often see in related work sections and literature reviews, which are much more about assemblage, often listing in chronological or author-order, what things have been done, what topics have been covered, with little to no synthesis into a coherent new whole.

                    - In this vein, [[systematic review]]

                        - It's not just that they're more easily done in well-structured domains where we have a bit more agreement.

                        - It's also that these [[systematic review]]

                            - Granted, good reviews (especially [[mmeta-analysis]]

                                - Especially in medicine (e.g., [[Cochrane systematic reviews]]

                    - #Thought-Fragment Additionally, the [[IVEO Matrix]]

        - [[CLM - Some degree of formalism is necessary for compositionality]]

        - Unfortunately, [[CLM - Gracefully integrating formalism into interactive systems is hard]]

    - R-Sources

        - Four [[Positivist]]

        - Introduces the [[Learning Loop Complex]]
