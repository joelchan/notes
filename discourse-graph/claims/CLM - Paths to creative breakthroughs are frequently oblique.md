    - Description

        - [[[[THE]] - Accretion theory of ideation]] ([[@sosaAccretionTheoryIdeation2019]]): the "worth" of ideas lies not in their immediate usefulness, but in what they can lead to, their effect on the problem solving process.

        - [[@chanImportanceIterationCreative2015]]: #Claim Building directly on diverse sources of inspiration doesn’t yield immediately creative ideas; these inspirations only turn into creative (i.e., both novel __and__ useful) ideas when people spend time iterating on the resulting ideas

        - And also [[@bergPrimalMarkHow2014]] - "novel primal marks" led to more novel but less useful ideas *initially*, but then when more familiar ideas were "infused", they ended up with better combinations of novelty and usefulness than starting out with familiar primal marks

            - Relatedly: "integrative primal marks" led to ideas that were more novel than familiar marks and more useful than novel primal marks, and had a higher "ceiling" of novelty and usefulness compared to either

- cc [[[[CLM]] - Paths to creative breakthroughs are frequently oblique]]?? or [[[[CLM]] - True creative breakthroughs often take a long time to develop]] and [[long search paths]]

    - reminds me though of example of need for [[synthesis]] / [[[[CLM]] - Scientific fields stall without adequate theoretical synthesis]], over contradictory, partial evidence, to find a better theory; case of scurvy
[[Week of January 31st, 2022]]

- Beautiful evocative thread from [[visakanv]] about "wrong notes" and how they can actually become right. VERY reminiscent of [[[[CLM]] - Paths to creative breakthroughs are frequently oblique]]

    - visa is doing final edits (99.9%) ✍🏾📖 on Twitter: ""When there's a note that doesn't work, there's a note on either side of the note that DOES work." NOBODY TELLS YOU THIS. "It's always easy! but we make it hard!". "A minute ago this note didn't work, but now it does. I can *erase* the wrong note by *making music*." Amazing https://t.co/mlhCU45PDU" / Twitter: https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1086670220909895682
[[CLM - Core attribute (mis)matches mediate the benefits of analogies in real-world, complex problem solving]]

- For example, there is some evidence that [[[[CLM]] - Paths to creative breakthroughs are frequently oblique]], and [analogies might be similar]([[[[CLM]] - A significant proportion of the benefits of analogical stimuli is oblique or indirect]]).

    - We sort of inch towards something like this in our experiments with [[Hyeonsu]] ([[WP: Augmenting scientific creativity with analogical inspirations]]), with our ideas about [[generative misalignment]], and focusing more on "creative adaptation" vs. direct application

        - To be more precise, though, we're still evaluating the "worth" of individual ideas, instead of considering its downstream effects, which would be closer to the idea in [[[[THE]] - Accretion theory of ideation]]

- Gruber proposes the idea of "[[by-productive thinking]]” (possible [examples of](#[[example-of]]) [[[[CLM]] - Paths to creative breakthroughs are frequently oblique]]).

    - A few main examples of these

        - [[Darwin's theory of coral formation]]

            - p. 101-102 --> struggle, branching

            - p. 111-112

        - [[Darwin's monad theory of evolution]]

            - discarded quite quickly, but gave the image of the [[irregularly branching tree of nature]], which was super important in his thought, including fueling his rejection of key implicit assumptions of contemporary theories about symmetry in the structure of species (cf. e.g., [[Quinarian system of classification]], p. 112)

        - search for causes of variation, including concept of [[hybridization]] (p. 103-106)

            - crucial preparation for recognizing significance of [[Malthus]] and the analogy between artifical selection and natural selection

                - led him down a "rabbit hole" of literature and field work on breeding
