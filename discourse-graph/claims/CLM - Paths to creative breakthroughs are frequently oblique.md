    - Description

        - [[[[THE]] - Accretion theory of ideation]] ([[@sosaAccretionTheoryIdeation2019]]): the "worth" of ideas lies not in their immediate usefulness, but in what they can lead to, their effect on the problem solving process.

        - [[@chanImportanceIterationCreative2015]]: #Claim Building directly on diverse sources of inspiration doesn‚Äôt yield immediately creative ideas; these inspirations only turn into creative (i.e., both novel¬†__and__¬†useful) ideas when people spend time iterating on the resulting ideas

        - And also [[@bergPrimalMarkHow2014]] - "novel primal marks" led to more novel but less useful ideas *initially*, but then when more familiar ideas were "infused", they ended up with better combinations of novelty and usefulness than starting out with familiar primal marks

            - Relatedly: "integrative primal marks" led to ideas that were more novel than familiar marks and more useful than novel primal marks, and had a higher "ceiling" of novelty and usefulness compared to either
