    - Description:

        - As people consume complex information, such as a complex theoretical idea, a nonfiction book, or a longform blogpost, they need to do it in multiple levels and stages of processing.

        - We see this in our preliminary findings from the [[WP: Synthesis empirical paper]], where people roughly have an exploratory reading step, where they mark things that are "interesting", later summarize these markings into a per-source summary, and then later integrate into larger synthesis documents/maps.

        - Many expert knowledge workers have created processes to systematically move their ideas towards higher/deeper levels of processing from which they can build new ideas. For example, [[SÃ¶nke Ahrens]], in describing the principles behind the [[sys/Zettelkasten]], writes about reading "with a pen in hand", collect thoughts in your inbox, and then create more durable notes later on #[[@ahrensHowTakeSmart2017]]. [[Tiago Forte]] talks about using [[progressive summarization]] to transform ideas from lower levels of "raw" data towards being more of [[Permanent Notes]] that you can build your ideas on. [[Andy Matuschak]] has a similar concept, but uses the name [[sys/Evergreen Notes]].

        - This idea is a #generalization-of the observations that [[[[CLM]] - Scholars constantly need to reread during a literature review]] and [[[[CLM]] - Sensemaking requires iterative loops of (re)interpreting data in light of evolving schemas]], among others.
