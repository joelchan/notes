    - Description:

        - As people consume complex information, such as a complex theoretical idea, a nonfiction book, or a longform blogpost, they need to do it in multiple levels and stages of processing.

        - We see this in our preliminary findings from the [[WP Synthesis empirical paper]]

        - Many expert knowledge workers have created processes to systematically move their ideas towards higher/deeper levels of processing from which they can build new ideas. For example, [[SÃ¶nke Ahrens]]

        - This idea is a #generalization-of the observations that [[CLM - Scholars constantly need to reread during a literature review]]
