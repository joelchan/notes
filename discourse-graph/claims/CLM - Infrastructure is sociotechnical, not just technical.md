    - for [[Grant proposal for Synthesis Infrastructure - NSF CHS / SOS 2020]], we want to make clear that we're after not just technological changes to the [[infrastructure]], but also discovering patterns of social and behavioral practices that need to "go together" with the technological changes, in order to "grow" the novel infrastructure

    - EVD:: designers informally "catalog" this knowledge about one another. Informants told us that, to be valued by one's peers, it was important to establish a reputation for having expertise that is distinctive within the community of IDEO designers

        - EVD:: "The model is you become a real expert and you're recognized [around] the company as being an expert in that particular field.'
