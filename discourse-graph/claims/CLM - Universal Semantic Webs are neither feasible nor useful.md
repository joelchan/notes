    - Description

        - Not feasible, because it's really hard to motivate people to contribute to something that is maybe useful for some unknown others at some unknown times, but not immediately useful to me.

            - Can probably overcome this somewhat with lots of money, but you're always going to have a severe upper limit on [[sustainability]].

        - But also not useful even if we made it!

            - There is a fundamental idea that the project of creating a human-wide knowledge base (a la [[Semantic Web]]) must fail, because [[[[CLM]] - Knowledge is fundamentally contextual]]

            - See also: [[[[CL]] - Multiplicity is necessary for synthesis]], and [[[[CLM]] - Contextualizability is necessary for synthesis]]
