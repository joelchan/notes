    - Description

        - Not feasible, because it's really hard to motivate people to contribute to something that is maybe useful for some unknown others at some unknown times, but not immediately useful to me.

            - Can probably overcome this somewhat with lots of money, but you're always going to have a severe upper limit on [[sustainability]].

        - But also not useful even if we made it!

            - There is a fundamental idea that the project of creating a human-wide knowledge base (a la [[Semantic Web]]) must fail, because [[[[CLM]] - Knowledge is fundamentally contextual]]

            - See also: [[[[CL]] - Multiplicity is necessary for synthesis]], and [[[[CLM]] - Contextualizability is necessary for synthesis]]

        - > Unlike data models in most applications, which are grounded with a specific purpose and oriented in a specific context, knowledge graphs tend to be open-ended, projecting anything and everything into one space. Again, this is in the essence of their value proposition, but it means that the ontology that emerges is one that nobody actually believes in, for lack of a better phrase. Knowledge graphs are supposed to be general-purpose, but that means they are for __no-purpose__. The general purpose does not exist in the same way that the average man does not exist, and designing for and around it invites the same kind of unintended consequences. These unintended consequences can be benign or oppressive - weird quirks or systemic bias. And this is all especially sobering given that information is an increasingly relevant form of power, and that representation (i.e., ontology) is relatively subtle and difficult to change.

- Came across a series of papers that add more nuance to the idea of [[[[CLM]] - Universal Semantic Webs are neither feasible nor useful]], but this time regarding the desirability of a fully connected network with *no* friction to information sharing #[[Z]], and also relevant for [[D/Solution-Diversity]]

    - revisit [[@bernsteinNewLookSemantic2016]]

    - This is known as the [[Zollman Effect]]

                - The less connected the network, the more likely theyâ€™ll find the truth. And a bigger community is more likely to find the truth too

    - The papers

        - [[@lazerNetworkStructureExploration2007]] Made a computational model of problem solving with a linear network vs. totally connected network, and found that totally connected networks tended to converge to lower optima, and also much fewer total solutions

            - I think this means that you *want* [[synthesis]] to be good, but not perfect, at least when you're doing the work still, and if the problem is complex?

            - BUT! be careful! see this paper questioning the robustness of these computational findings and relevance to real-world scenarios of scientific discovery [[@rosenstockEpistemicNetworksLess2016]]

                - We show that previous results from epistemic network models by Kevin J. S. Zollman and Erich Kummerfeld showing the benefits of decreased connectivity in epistemic networks are not robust across changes in parameter values. Our findings motivate discussion about whether and how such models can inform real world epistemic communities.

            - Here, with an experiment, found that When communication networks were more centralized with two-way flow of information, the network achieved the benefits of social influence (learning) without the costs (herding).

- From an efficacy standpoint, also runs afoul of [[[[CLM]] - Knowledge is fundamentally contextual]], [[[[CLM]] - Universal Semantic Webs are neither feasible nor useful]], and infrastructure stuff, and sort of falls into the trap of assuming [[Conduit Metaphor]]

    - [[reuse]] feels like the wrong framing. or.. unproductive at least. something is off. there is an implicit assumption that i can literally use the component, like a circuit board piece, or a gear. but knowledge isn't like that. i don't think. cc [[[[EXP]] - [[D/Synthesis Infrastructure]] - Field study for discourse graph extension]]

    - Past thinking on this:

        - A fundamental uncertainty is whether the relatively formalized nature of [[[[PTN]] - discourse graph]] can be integrated with the open-ended, seemingly unstructured, backtrack-ridden, speculative and "half-baked" nature of thinking that underlies real synthesis (see [[@gruberDarwinManPsychological1974]] for vivid descriptions of this). Some past work on whether/how formality can be integrated into systems for supporting thinking suggests there is a real danger that imposing such formalisms may yield more harm (e.g., by cutting off speculative lines of inquiry, imposing too much overhead) than benefits in settings characterized by context-dependent, evolving requirements for formal structure, such as creative knowledge work in uncharted domains (see [[@shipmanFormalityConsideredHarmful1999]] for an excellent introduction to this). A related danger is that the kinds of knowledge that is necessary for
