    - Description

        - Possible reasons:

            - [[[[CLM]] - Specifying context for future reuse requires predicting trajectories of future reuse]], and it's hard to predict the future! Particularly if you want to creatively [[reuse]] something in quite different [[context]]s

            - [[[[CLM]] - Context is a slippery notion]], which means it can be quite hard to standardize (and therefore make efficient) expressions of [[context]] (e.g., in a dropdown menu of possible "contexts") [[@andersonDataBaseMent2008]]

###### Discourse Context

- **Informs::** [[QUE - How can we best bridge private vs. public knowledge]]
- **Supported By::** [[CLM - Specifying context for future reuse requires predicting trajectories of future reuse]]

- #CLlaimSecondary from [[@ackermanSharingKnowledgeExpertise2013]] about [[[[CLM]] - Specifying context for future reuse is costly]]

    - Since [[[[CLM]] - Context is a slippery notion]], which means ((pLB5JYk-W)) [[@andersonDataBaseMent2008]]

        - A fundamental insight for [[[[PTN]] - flexible compression]] could go further than a priori specification: [[context]] is always specified (reified?) **at use time** (i.e., [[context]]ually with specific [[context queries]])

- This is also related to the problem that [[[[CLM]] - Specifying context for future reuse is costly]]; both of these problems combine to create strong barriers to a shared synthesis infrastructure.

    - Again I think the problem sharpens considerably when we move from the individual [[PIM]] framing to consider how to share. Adding in [[reuse]], basically.

        - This sharpens the question of the [[P: Synthesis requirements theory paper]]: not just "how do we need to design tools to support synthesis", but

        - Another question then: are we talking about [[Collaborative]] synthesis, or something more like [[FLOSS development]], where we don't have direct coordination going on? Thinking of ideas like [[stigmergy]] and [[Stigmergic Coordination]] (main entry point for the latter is [[@boliciStigmergicCoordinationFLOSS2016]])

        - [[I wonder]] how we might design an "intermediate layer" between private and public knowledge?

            - Going back to [[@gruberDarwinManPsychological1974]] Idea of [[[[QUE]] - How can we best bridge private vs. public knowledge?]] is described very well here, and one of the central tensions of explaining the development of Darwin's idea of man
