    - Description

        - Possible reasons:

            - [[[[CLM]] - Specifying context for future reuse requires predicting trajectories of future reuse]], and it's hard to predict the future! Particularly if you want to creatively [[reuse]] something in quite different [[context]]s

            - [[[[CLM]] - Context is a slippery notion]], which means it can be quite hard to standardize (and therefore make efficient) expressions of [[context]] (e.g., in a dropdown menu of possible "contexts") [[@andersonDataBaseMent2008]]
