    - Description

        - This comes mostly from the [[CSCW]] literature on knowledge reuse and [[context]] (seminal review in [[@ackermanSharingKnowledgeExpertise2013]])

        - For example:

            - [[[[CLM]] - People need information about history of changes to reuse information]]

            - [[[[CL]] - People need information about authorship to reuse information]]
