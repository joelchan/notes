    - Description

        - This comes mostly from the [[CSCW]] literature on knowledge reuse and [[context]] (seminal review in [[@ackermanSharingKnowledgeExpertise2013]])

        - For example:

            - [[[[CLM]] - People need information about history of changes to reuse information]]

            - [[[[CL]] - People need information about authorship to reuse information]]

[[CLM - Context and privacy are in tension when sharing knowledge with others]]

- Well, you might say, let's just share the stuff that's ready to be shared, then, and only those things! Just the public-ready stuff. But there is a related challenge here that makes this problem harder: [[[[CLM]] - Knowledge must be recontextualized to be usefully reused]].

    - The implication of this is that sharing __only__ entry points into a knowledge graph will likely severely blunt their usefulness for others.

    - Without understanding why an idea was written, how it relates to other ideas, what its precise meaning is in the [[context]] of the knowledge sharer, and how that idea is warranted or grounded in observations, details, and evidence, the "mileage" of that piece of information is extremely limited.

            - some types of [[context]] information were more contextual, depending on the particular "hypothesis projection" of the review, which varied across the lifecycle of the project studied (e.g., location of medical condition, amount of exposure, confounding risk factors), while others were more constant regardless of hypothesis (e.g., study- and population-context information)

            - [[@blakeCollaborativeInformationSynthesis2006]]: director of the public health group estimated that she spent ~3 hrs per article to extract [[context]] information required  for a particular [[systematic review]]

    - [Decentralized project documentation](((BMX6-DOV6))) made recontextualization difficult for [engineers](((CUoGHVXbV))) because they didn't know the [history of changes for a document or if a particular document was up to date](((ANL0-Gihc))), leading to issues such as ["exploratory digging by hand" to avoid damaging power lines](((ZXWd_oKNJ))) pg 375 [[@hinrichsContextGrabbingAssigning2005]]

    - To properly deal with a [discrepancy in benefits from the caller](((aJyU_lBdO))), a [HLG employee](((95SLsSLsN))) needed to [[reuse]] information from the [CARL database](((OLechJ6p6))), among other sources of information, to create an escalation to the benefits group. To do this, she needed important [[context]] that was missing from the CARL record itself, such as details of the record's creation or maintenance (was it authoritative?), and any circumstances surrounding the caller's employment. The HLG employee dealt with this missing context by consulting an expert (a senior agent) and her own memory, rather than searching databases for additional information, even though that information could in principle be in there.

    - In [a case study of calendar systems](((e021Zn_8X))), having [metadata for event information](((H-T2qFmhr))) such as the title of the event or arrival time of the speaker, in addition to who the author of the information is, were critical for the interpretation of the events.  [[@dourishInformationContextLessons1993]]

    - In a [case study](((1NQJ4Lkwn))) (methods [1](((HH7e2hyT2))), [2](((8pTMoQtJD)))), Healthcare workers used a system which featured a drop-down menu that would allow them to select relevant contextual information to attach to a file where they recorded patient interactions. However, the options in the [drop-down menu](((SdDwD5xWe))) were frequently [not specific enough, or too many options were available](((_b8X5Ey1Z))), which led to the employees [choosing the closest option, or a catch all ‚ÄúNot Specified‚Äù option](((w-26O9uLq))). This all led to ambiguous contextual information capture which [proved problematic down the line](((IxXKHy5DM))).  [[@andersonDataBaseMent2008]]

- key learnings from the first two field studies of [[sys/Answer Garden]] are super releveant: we [should read]([[‚û∞ breadcrumbs]]). that's where the evidence is. but the claim basically is that [context is necessary to make information useful]([[[[CLM]] - Knowledge must be recontextualized to be usefully reused]]), and often it's best to get that context from a person. this is the major motivation for maknig the answer garden not just a repo, but also a help-seeking platform

    - something intersting to keep in mind when we read those papers, is to consider how their users compare to ours. interesting obseration cited here is that in many cases people did *not* need context.
