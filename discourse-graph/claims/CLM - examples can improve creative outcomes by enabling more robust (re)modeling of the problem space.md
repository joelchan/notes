- Revisiting [[[[CLM]] - examples can improve creative outcomes by enabling more robust (re)modeling of the problem space]] for [[[[THE]] - interaction-oriented theory of creative inspiration from examples]]

    - I would say that this hypothesis in the theory is definitely more uncertain than the previous ones, which have been well-studied, with various interventions tested for inducing them. This is why we need to test it!

    - The more interesting thing we can do from this is hypothesize what sorts of interfaces and interactions with examples would facilitate or hinder this modeling pathway.

        - There is a fuzzy hypothesis that we're testing with the [[[[EXP]] - [[D/Solution-Diversity]] - exploring presentation interaction effects on mechanism of inspiration from diverse examples]], in our comparisons: we can think of one dimension as (as [[Jason Ding]] writes) "^^greater or lesser distance from the problem representation^^". In the in-context interfaces, the examples are directly superimposed on the problem representation (which is a simple 2D grid with overlaid values). When we say "in-context", what do we mean? In context of what? I think we mean examples in context of the problem/solution space.

        - Extending this beyond our toy problem, what might this look like?

            - I'm thinking about the role of **curation**. See maybe [[@kerneStrategiesFreeFormWeb2017]], although... I don't love the distance between the students and design experts. But worth a look.

                - I think the part of this that is catching my interest is the distinction between classification/categorization and curation (where the latter is much more goal-oriented, particularly in the individual case). I expect to see "categories" and groupings and connections that are much more oriented to and aligned with idiosyncratic parts of the evolving model of the problem/solution space.

                - In curation interfaces, the distance between examples and model of the space approaches zero, similar to ours.

                - We might expect greater flexibility in problem formulations, then, for people who are able to curate examples in a much closer fashion.

            - I think it's interesting to think of "near misses", like tagging. Where the mechanics might constrain mapping to elements of the problem space, and nudge more towards categorization/classification. That is the BIG difference I experience between what I had with [[sys/Sente]] back during my PhD, and what we have now in Roam with the d/graph.

            - [[mood board]]s are similar. [[@kochSemanticCollageEnrichingDigital2020]] and [[@kochImageSenseIntelligentCollaborative2020]]

                - what is interesting about [[sys/SemanticCollage]] and [[sys/ImageSense]] I think is the ability of the designers to *define* the model of the example space, in conversation with their model of the "problem/solution space" (on the mood board)

                - in fact, [[AndrÃ©s Lucero]] (who is on these papers) also has a bunch of papers digging into this (found through this [[sys/ConnectedPapers]] [map](https://www.connectedpapers.com/main/dc90eab30d08907c810fd12ebe9723609f49a0cd/Understanding-knowledge-management-practices-for-early-design-activity-and-its-implications-for-reuse/graph) around [[@sharminUnderstandingKnowledgeManagement2009b]])

    - Here is the core argument for it

            - This idea of formulation also has deep roots in cognitive science, in the basic decision-making and learning literature

            - [[Insight problem solving]]

            - {{[[TODO]]}} what are the essential core citations for this? core ideas and demonstrations? key results?

            - Somewhat in parallel, in the domain of design theory and methodology, various theorists have also [[@dorstCoreDesignThinking2011]]

                - Although [[@goelStructureDesignProblem1992]] directly extended Simon's notion of problem spaces to thinking about design spaces

                - And there is a thread of work on trying to model what this space looks like.

            - As early back as [[@newellElementsTheoryHuman1958]], cognitive scientists began to model problem solving as search in a problem space.

                - Within general cognitive science, there are various N-space models

                    - [[@klahrDualSpaceSearch1988]] extended the problem space model to account for scientific discovery as joint search in a space of hypotheses and a space of experiments.

                - Quite a few detailed experiments with specific problems (e.g., [[Tower of Hanoi]]) exploring aspects of problem representation

                    - One interesting experiment is in [[@kotovskyWhatMakesProblems1990]], which identifies learning about what even constitutes a "move" as a key determinant of a problem's difficulty (in contrast to the size of the search space)

            - The core intuition across these threads is quite straightforward: in order to propose solutions for a problem, you need to have a sense of what the problem is. This allows you to check

            - In a related but separate line of research, more in the Gestalt tradition in cognitive science, research on [[Insight problem solving]] also articulates the centrality of problem representations as a determinant of impasses and problem difficulty, and the need for insight (insufficiency of "basic" procedures). This line of research seeks to explain the phenomenology and mechanics of insight or "Aha" moments, which are described by creators as an experience of an emotion-laden "leap" in progress on a problem: it often feels like solving the problem in one step, particularly after a long period of being stuck.

                - A key reference for this to start with is [[@ohlssonInformationprocessingExplanationsInsight1992]]

                - Key experiments we know about

                    - [[[[EVD]] - Representing a mutilated checkerboard in a way that made perceptual features of squares more salient facilitated problem reformulation and insight - [[@kaplanSearchInsight1990]]]]

        - Experiences with problem elements can trigger/support problem formulation

            - Design moves / experential learning

                    - [[[[EVD]] - estimated semantic networks of animal concepts from montessori-educated children were more interconnected, with shorter paths between concepts and fewer subcommunities, compared to networks from traditional-schooled but comparable children - [[@denervaudEducationShapesStructure2021]]]]

            - [[[[CLM]] - Design proceeds by co-evolution of problem and solution space]]

                - [[@goelStructureDesignProblem1992]] argues that design behavior arises as an adaptive response to the ill-structure nature of design problem spaces. This may explain a bias towards design moves and "solution-orientedness" in designers

            - this thread is sparse, but we might define a task to try to flesh it out more, using our strategies:

                - scite

                - connectedpapers

                - relatedpapers

                - authors

                - they're not super well-connected in citation graph, though.

                - keywords from

                - semanticscholar

        - We can draw an analogy between design moves and examples - in fact, the literature in org/management science talks about "vicarious learning" as a complement to experiential learning

            - [[@baumannEffectiveSearchRugged2019]]: [[@baumannEffectiveSearchRugged2019]] and [[@csaszarHowMuchCopy2010]] are entry points into organizational lit that articulates variants of this relating to 'copying' / imitation - with one idea being that simple copying is different from "lossy" copying that induces/complements experential learning (making your own moves)

        - In sum, these lines of argumentation and evidence converge on a pathway of examples improving creative outcomes by enabling more robust (re)modeling of the problem space.
[[THE - interaction-oriented theory of creative inspiration from examples]]

- ### Model: [[[[CLM]] - examples can improve creative outcomes by enabling more robust (re)modeling of the problem space]]

    - The [lit on this]([[SupportedBy]]) comes moreso from research in a more qualitative and ethnographic tradition, rather than experimental, focusing on developing theory from __in situ__ observations of creative practice with examples.

        - [[[[EVD]] - designers used examples to shape their understanding of the problem before generating solutions - [[@herringGettingInspiredUnderstanding2009]]]]

        - [[[[EVD]] - professional designers curated examples to understand trends and design approaches to inform their design, vs. simple direct transfer of solution approaches - [[@sharminUnderstandingKnowledgeManagement2009b]]]]

        - [[[[EVD]] - Two artists used individual artworks to shape not just their ideas, but used a process of "analogical modification" to search for and modify higher-order concepts, and their creative vision. This process unfolded over the course of years. - [[@okadaAnalogicalModificationCreation2009]]]]

        - [[[[EVD]] - Engineering design students used multiple cross-domain analogies to fulfill design needs, and they could use analogies to get inspiration of how to decompose the problem and find new analogies. - [[@helmsCompoundAnalogicalDesign2008]]]]

    - Finally, we have the functional outcome of modeling. Here, there is a greater distance between the specific features of examples and what ideas result: rather than serving as stimulation, or sources of specific features to transfer or recombine, the examples are used to induce a higher level model of one or more relevant design spaces, problem formulations, or frames, which then guides exploration.

    - Examples of this include...

    - The core idea here is that the examples here are used for more than solution elements; they interact in intricate ways with the designers' formulation, or model, of the problem. They are used to get a higher level sense of promising directions, the shape of the space, and sometimes even to trigger and support reformulation of the problem itself.

    - But there is also concepts and evidence along the lines of [[[[THE]] - Cognitive Flexibility Theory (CFT)]] that, on first blush, does not seem to be directly related to creativity support tools, but shares a deep underlying connection.

        - Certain kinds of experiences (unstructured, self-directed, contextualized) lead to representations that are more conceptually flexible, and can be applied in new ways

            - [[[[EVD]] - higher conceptual flexibility to classify organisms based on taxonomic and ecological relations if children were older, from more rural areas, and engaged in more unstructured interactions with organisms - [[@betzDevelopmentConceptualFlexibility2020]]]]

            - [[[[EVD]] - overall salience of taxonomic relations for organizing living things for 6-12 year old children - [[@betzDevelopmentConceptualFlexibility2020]]]]

            - cites [[@lazerNetworkStructureExploration2007]], which is entry point into [this thread](Came across a series of papers that add more nuance to the idea of [[[[CLM]] - Universal Semantic Webs are neither feasible nor useful]], but this time regarding the desirability of a fully connected network with *no* friction to information sharing #[[Z]], and also relevant for [[D/Solution-Diversity]]) about the [[Zollman Effect]] (roughly: the more you know from your competitors, the worse off the global max is)

                - it's more tuned at "finding the truth", rather than ideation, so keep that in mind.

    - in our case, it's not just about learning the structure of the environment (as it's framed in social learning): it's also RESTRUCTURING the environment!!

    - this whole thread sparked by [this tweet](Antoine Coutrot on Twitter: "I'm so happy to announce our paper out in @nature today!
