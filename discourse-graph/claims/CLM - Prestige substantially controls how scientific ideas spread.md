    - Description:

        - Through faculty hiring

            - [[@morganPrestigeDrivesEpistemic2018]], although result by itself is weak: it's based on results from #m/Model repurposing an SIS model from epidemiology, with ((JUFsOhKV5)), since [[[[CLM]] - Prediction in complex social systems is fundamentally limited]]

                - Although there are priors from other investigations: recent example here (in the film industry) #[[@juhaszBrokeringCorePeriphery2020]]

                - And we also have empirical evidence of inequalities in hiring controlled by prestige [[@clausetSystematicInequalityHierarchy2015]]

        - As a specific manifestation of [[[[CLM]] - Scientific peer review is deeply flawed]]

            - this made the rounds on twitter: "In a controlled experiment with two disjoint program committees, the ACM International Conference on¬†Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM'17) found that reviewers with author information were 1.76x more¬†likely to recommend acceptance of papers from famous authors, and 1.67x more likely to recommend¬†acceptance of papers from top institutions.‚Äù (from¬†[here](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/6/228027-effectiveness-of-anonymization-in-double-blind-review/fulltext#R6), referencing¬†[this study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.00502.pdf); famous precursor to this is the peters and ceci study that showed many papers from prestigious authors/institutions didn‚Äôt make it through the next time; commentary on that¬†[here](https://thewinnower.com/discussions/7-_the-_peters-_ceci-_study-_of-_journal-_publications))
