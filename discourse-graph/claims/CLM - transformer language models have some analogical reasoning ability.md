- some good performance on [[four-term analogy problems]] i think in [[@brownLanguageModelsAre2020]]? [[@teamWorldCreationAnalogy2020]] quotes [[@brownLanguageModelsAre2020]] at ~65% performance
- also here are some proofs-of-concept that give me pause

    - e.g., [[@stayMachinamentaFormingExtended2020]], in a very short blog post, [[[[EVD]] - given one set of objects from a few classic analogies such as solar system / atom, [[sys/GPT-3]] was able to complete the corresponding objects on the other side for a few examples - [[@stayMachinamentaFormingExtended2020]]]]
