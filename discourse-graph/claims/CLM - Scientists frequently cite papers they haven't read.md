    - "In particular our model and data suggest that around 70% to 80% of papers cited are 'subsidiary papers', that is papers which are also cited by the other papers in the bibliography, the 'core papers'. Similar results have been seen by [[@simkinStochasticModelingCitation2005]] who use a similar model but different data and methods to arrive at this result. From a different perspective, [[@cloughTransitiveReductionCitation2015]] have also shown that around 80% of citations are removed from arXiv citation networks through the process of transitive reduction (an extended version of the declustering algorithm used here).…”

    - FWIW, these findings are consistent with a couple other later papers, [per scite](https://scite.ai/reports/stochastic-modeling-of-citation-slips-Odndy8?contradicting=false&mentioning=false&page=1&utm_campaign=badge_generic&utm_medium=plugin&utm_source=generic)
