    - Description

        - For problems that are high on [[interdisciplinarity]], search-based strategies for [[literature reviewing]] can be extremely noisy, and often feel counterproductive.

        - Research on [[Domain-Analysis]], which studies how characteristics of a knowledge domain shape people's information needs and what information seeking strategies are useful, can help explain why.

        - Basically, the chain of reasoning that helps explain this goes like this:

            1. Domains can be more or less characterized by [[Scatter]] [(@moteReasonsVariationInformation1962)]([[@moteReasonsVariationInformation1962]]). Low scatter domain = underlying principles well-developed (paradigmatic??), lit well organized, width of subject area relatively small and clearly defined. High scatter domain is.. the opposite. :)

            1. [[Scatter]] makes [[ðŸ§± foraging]] (finding relevant sources) harder [(@moteReasonsVariationInformation1962)](Scholars in fields of study with high degree of [[Scatter]] self-reported needing longer searches (> 30 mins) about 20x more frequently compared to scholars in low [[Scatter]] fields), but recommendation by a human can really help ([@packerImportanceSDICurrent1979](((rPbv2OT8Y)))).

            1. Domains can also be characterized by the degree to which relevance is driven by [[Topical Relevance]] (we agree what the objects are and how they are defined) or by [[paradigmatic relevance]] (relevance is defined by varying schools of thoughts/positions on theories/methodologies, etc. (see [[@taljaReasonsUseNon2003]])). ([R: taljaReasonsUseNon2003](((nGk6nwqQv))), [R: hjorlandEpistemologySociocognitivePerspective2002](((zjiAVjElh)))).

            1. Different notions of relevance lend themselves better to different strategies: for example, if [[Topical Relevance]] is the primary thing, then search/keywords are powerful; but if [[paradigmatic relevance]] is primary, then search/keywords aren't so useful, and other strategies like [[Browsing]] and [[chaining]] tend to be more useful ([R: taljaReasonsUseNon2003](#Claim Subject headings and keyword searches are more effective for domains with high [[Topical Relevance]]; in domains characterized more by [[paradigmatic relevance]], these stragies are less useful, and other strategies like [[chaining]] or [[Browsing]] are more powerful. (p. 683)))

            1. Interdisciplinary domains [tend to be high-scatter]([[[[CLM]] - Interdisciplinary synthesis is hard because of scatter in the literature]]) ([[@bates1996learning]], [[@palmerWorkBoundariesScience2001]]), and also include multiple paradigms!

        - The upshot of all this is that if people working on a topic characterized by [[interdisciplinarity]] need stronger medicine than advanced search/database strategies.

            - **Networks --- [often via people]([[[[QUE]] - What are the most efficient routes to useful cross-boundary knowledge?]]), whether directly, or indirectly (via papers/citations --- are extremely important**!

- You want to use people as your primary conduit, because [[[[CLM]] - In interdisciplinary domains, network-based foraging is more powerful than search-based foraging]]

    - Take advantage of the iSchool's interdisciplinarity. If you want to get into area X, there's a pretty good chance that there's someone in the iSchool who can be your first guide or at least introduce you to one. Examples: Tammie exploring difficult and productive conversations, I introduce her to an expert on online deliberation. Sarah Valkamp interested in labor and AI, strongly intersects with economics, I introduce her to an economist I know.

    - This also means that getting a sense of the key players is important. Bear in mind, though, that networks can be biased, so triangulate, particularly in areas (of which there are many!) with much balkanization and marginalization of certain voices.

        - #quotes

            - But a side effect of the writing-as-networking strategy is that writing about your other interests gets other people interested. Youâ€™re not just identifying neighbors in your intellectual ghetto; youâ€™re recruiting more. If more of your friends do it, you get exposed to more ideas. At a very micro-scale, a long essay about a topic you might be interested in is like a long conversation about the same, except that itâ€™s a lot less rude to check out thirty seconds into it when you conclude that itâ€™s boring stuff for a different kind of nerd.

- My research is extremely interdisciplinary, which makes [structured search quite challenging to rely on alone]([[[[CLM]] - In interdisciplinary domains, network-based foraging is more powerful than search-based foraging]]); I need to rely often on network-based [[ðŸ§± foraging]], such as footnote-chasing, or citation-[[chaining]].

    - Some brief notes on why:

        - [[Scatter]] makes [[ðŸ§± foraging]] (finding relevant sources) harder [(@moteReasonsVariationInformation1962)](((2Wg2lWqCK))), but recommendation by a human can really help ([@packerImportanceSDICurrent1979](((rPbv2OT8Y)))).

        - Domains can also be characterized by the degree to which relevance is driven by [[Topical Relevance]] (we agree what the objects are and how they are defined) or by [[paradigmatic relevance]] (((hBL8qMrLZ))). ([R: taljaReasonsUseNon2003](((nGk6nwqQv))), [R: hjorlandEpistemologySociocognitivePerspective2002](((zjiAVjElh)))).

        - Different notions of relevance lend themselves better to different strategies: for example, if [[Topical Relevance]] is the primary thing, then search/keywords are powerful; but if [[paradigmatic relevance]] is primary, then search/keywords aren't so useful, and other strategies like [[Browsing]] and [[chaining]] tend to be more useful ([R: taljaReasonsUseNon2003](((4uxOYFqKc))))

        - Interdisciplinary domains [tend to be high-scatter]([[[[CLM]] - Interdisciplinary synthesis is hard because of scatter in the literature]]) ([[@bates1996learning]], [[@palmerWorkBoundariesScience2001]]), and also include multiple paradigms!

        - Domains can be more or less characterized by [[Scatter]] [(@moteReasonsVariationInformation1962)]([[@moteReasonsVariationInformation1962]]). Low scatter domain = underlying principles well-developed (paradigmatic??), lit well organized, width of subject area relatively small and clearly defined. High scatter domain is.. the opposite. :)

    - There is a bit of an analogy here to [[shepardizing]] in law

        - Example: Martine used [[shepardizing]] to zero in on a promising molecule, then formed a biotech company ([United Therapeutics](https://www.unither.com/index.html)) to buy the molecule, and develop a drug (I believe it's [Remodulin](https://www.remodulin.com/pulmonary-arterial-hypertension-treatment/our-story/), per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Therapeutics#cite_note-FDA_2002-9))

            - Around ~15m in Dr. Martine Rothblatt â€” A Masterclass on Asking Better Questions and Peering Into the Future (#487) â€“ The Blog of Author Tim Ferriss https://tim.blog/2020/12/16/martine-rothblatt/

    - Observation: I don't rely only on chaining/shephardizing: in situations where I want to have the highest confidence of coverage, I will then use structured keyword searches in databases, but that requires a high degree of understanding of the language being used as well as the specific places to search (again, challenging in interdisciplinary areas where relevant work is scattered across many different terms and venues).

    - Here is a quick snapshot of where this strategy sits in my overall workflow for [[ðŸ§± foraging]]

    - #Thought-Fragment This is partially the inspiration for why I added a graph/list option in the wireframe. Maybe, a between-subjects study during the interface evaluation could help reaffirm this claim?
