    - Description

        - For problems that are high on [[interdisciplinarity]]

        - Research on [[Domain-Analysis]]

        - Basically, the chain of reasoning that helps explain this goes like this:

            1. Domains can be more or less characterized by [[Scatter]]

            1. [[Scatter]]

            1. Domains can also be characterized by the degree to which relevance is driven by [[Topical Relevance]]

            1. Different notions of relevance lend themselves better to different strategies: for example, if [[Topical Relevance]]

            1. Interdisciplinary domains [tend to be high-scatter]([[CLM - Interdisciplinary synthesis is hard because of scatter in the literature]]

        - The upshot of all this is that if people working on a topic characterized by [[interdisciplinarity]]
