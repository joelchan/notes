    - Description

        - For problems that are high on [[interdisciplinarity]], search-based strategies for [[literature reviewing]] can be extremely noisy, and often feel counterproductive.

        - Research on [[Domain-Analysis]], which studies how characteristics of a knowledge domain shape people's information needs and what information seeking strategies are useful, can help explain why.

        - Basically, the chain of reasoning that helps explain this goes like this:

            1. Domains can be more or less characterized by [[Scatter]] [(@moteReasonsVariationInformation1962)]([[@moteReasonsVariationInformation1962]]). Low scatter domain = underlying principles well-developed (paradigmatic??), lit well organized, width of subject area relatively small and clearly defined. High scatter domain is.. the opposite. :)

            1. [[Scatter]] makes [[ðŸ§± foraging]] (finding relevant sources) harder [(@moteReasonsVariationInformation1962)](Scholars in fields of study with high degree of [[Scatter]] self-reported needing longer searches (> 30 mins) about 20x more frequently compared to scholars in low [[Scatter]] fields), but recommendation by a human can really help ([@packerImportanceSDICurrent1979](((rPbv2OT8Y)))).

            1. Domains can also be characterized by the degree to which relevance is driven by [[Topical Relevance]] (we agree what the objects are and how they are defined) or by [[paradigmatic relevance]] (relevance is defined by varying schools of thoughts/positions on theories/methodologies, etc. (see [[@taljaReasonsUseNon2003]])). ([R: taljaReasonsUseNon2003](((nGk6nwqQv))), [R: hjorlandEpistemologySociocognitivePerspective2002](((zjiAVjElh)))).

            1. Different notions of relevance lend themselves better to different strategies: for example, if [[Topical Relevance]] is the primary thing, then search/keywords are powerful; but if [[paradigmatic relevance]] is primary, then search/keywords aren't so useful, and other strategies like [[Browsing]] and [[chaining]] tend to be more useful ([R: taljaReasonsUseNon2003](#Claim Subject headings and keyword searches are more effective for domains with high [[Topical Relevance]]; in domains characterized more by [[paradigmatic relevance]], these stragies are less useful, and other strategies like [[chaining]] or [[Browsing]] are more powerful. (p. 683)))

            1. Interdisciplinary domains [tend to be high-scatter]([[[[CLM]] - Interdisciplinary synthesis is hard because of scatter in the literature]]) ([[@bates1996learning]], [[@palmerWorkBoundariesScience2001]]), and also include multiple paradigms!

        - The upshot of all this is that if people working on a topic characterized by [[interdisciplinarity]] need stronger medicine than advanced search/database strategies.

            - **Networks --- [often via people]([[[[QUE]] - What are the most efficient routes to useful cross-boundary knowledge?]]), whether directly, or indirectly (via papers/citations --- are extremely important**!
