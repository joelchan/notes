    - Description

        - Many are by [[bricolage]]

            - [[@anujacabraalWhyUseNVivo2012]]

            - [[[[List]]: Examples of lead users building their own thing]]

            - See also [[Z: Lead user innovation can generate important conceptual insights]]

            - [[Raul Pacheco-Vega]] is a researcher who blogs about his process, which is a mix of things he calls [synthetic notes](http://www.raulpacheco.org/2017/05/writing-synthetic-notes-of-journal-articles-and-book-chapters/) (analogous to compressed individual grounded claims) and [memoranda](http://www.raulpacheco.org/2016/07/writing-effective-memorandums/) (which synthesize across claims; #[[@pacheco-vegaWritingMemorandums2020]]) and Conceptual Excel Dumps (more elaborate compositions) (see, e.g., #[[R: pacheco-vegaSynthesizingDifferentBodies2016]] )

                - The practice of synthetic-note and memo-writing are inspired in part by the practice of memo-writing in qualitative research (see, e.g., [Corbin and Strauss's grounded theory guide](https://www.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/17552_Chapter_6.pdf)). See also [[[[CLM]] - Scholars repurpose qualitative data analysis software to facilitate synthesis]]

                    - Money quote: "Writing memos should begin with the first analytic session and continue throughout the analytic process. Doing diagrams is more periodic but nevertheless very important. Doing memos and diagrams should never be viewed as chores, or as tasks to be agonized over. They are also not to be confused
with finished papers ready for publication. Rather, memos and diagrams begin as rather rudimentary representations of thought and grow in complexity, density, clarity, and accuracy as the research progresses. One of the complaints we often hear from students is that writing memos and doing diagrams are just too time consuming. They say that they would rather make a few notes in the margins of their field notes. We puzzle over those remarks. Writing memos and doing diagrams are part of the analysis, part of doing qualitative work. They move the analysis forward and as such are just as important to the research process as data gathering itself."

                    - Another money quote (about compression): "Though analysts can write on the actual interview or field notes, this is not practical, except perhaps in the earliest phases of open coding...it is difficult to retrieve information, in other words to combine or sort memos, if the margin of a field note or interview transcript is the only place where information has been stored"

            - [[sys/Zettelkasten]] or "slipbox" has the fundamental ideas of [[Atomicity]] and [[compositionality]]

                - It eschews folders and tags for a more innovative networked structure to allow for the notes to "talk back" to you)

                - A number of tools have been designed for and repurposed to support this practice (which was originally 100% analog), such as [[sys/TinderBox]], [[sys/ConnectedText]], Notion, etc., and more recently, of course, [[sys/RoamResearch]]

            - Others [apply the framework of qualitative analysis to literature reviewing]([[[[CLM]] - Scholars repurpose qualitative data analysis software to facilitate synthesis]]), correctly understanding the importance of [[context]] (rich, flexible connections to sources and their context) alongside [[Atomicity]] and [[compositionality]].

                - They repurpose QDA software like [[sys/NVIVO]] or [[sys/Atlas.TI]] (which now even has training videos and materials for this functionality). We actually know at least 1-2 people who do this.

                    - Collaboration is still very difficult, however.

- another thing to consider is that  "single-player' personal [[sys/Memex]] [[hypertext notebooks]] are kind of actually alive and well, albeit mostly living in hacker space (i.e., #[[[[CLM]] - Effective individual synthesis systems (seem to mostly) exist (for a select few)]])

    - examples: [[sys/TiddlyWiki]], the [[sys/Zettelkasten]] community's set of tools, etc.

    - lots of niche tools, none really mainstream, and i rarely see them in academic contexts. why? am i just in the wrong circles? why is it not more mainstream within academia, where the use case fits perfectly: incrementally over time build up complex and novel insights?

    - the bridge to "multiplayer" is hard though. that was the draw of the [[Semantic Web]] / [[std/Hypertext]] / [[sys/Xanadu]] vision, along with [[Doug Engelbart]]'s vision of augmenting collective intelligence

    - this is where fresh (to that world) ideas of [[infrastructure]], [[reuse]], and so on can perhaps transform that vision to a more tractable one that still retains the magic of hte original vision. or not? want to be careful that this isn't a [[Perpetual Motion Machine]]

    - What we see now is not infrastructure for synthesis. Instead, we see people either resort to all sorts of "hacks" and workarounds, or put in a substantial amount of work to "mine" publications for what they need (for an evocative example of this, see [[@knightEnslavedTrappedData2019]]). We have a whole cottage industry that is dedicated to fueling workarounds of this sort, for systematic reviewing. While these hacks often work well enough for the task at hand, they are rarely transferred in systematic ways across projects and people, violating the dimensions of "reach or scope" and "embodiment of standards", laid out by [[@starStepsEcologyInfrastructure1996]].
[[June 29th, 2020]]

- [[[[CLM]] - Effective individual synthesis systems (seem to mostly) exist (for a select few)]] -  same with technical standards.

    - we should build on top of this, instead of building new systems for people to adopt

    - so we're probably in the [[gateway phase of infrastructure growth]]?

        - Reading again this quote in #[[@edwardsUnderstandingInfrastructureDynamics2007]] while thinking about #[[[[PTN]] - Prefer to accrete new infrastructures on top of existing ones]] - I think the moment we are in for #[[D/Synthesis Infrastructure]] is somewhere in the [[gateway phase of infrastructure growth]]

- as I've said in the past [[[[CLM]] - Effective individual synthesis systems (seem to mostly) exist (for a select few)]]

    - the critical problem, though is this: because they're so individual, everyone is effectively an island. what if you don't have?

    - a small exception, again, is sofware for [[systematic review]]s, but again, this doesn't solve our problem, bc so much [[synthesis]] that we want to do goes far beyond [[RCT]]s

        - plus, they're often, afaict, "use once", not really supporting [[interoperability]] [[@oconnorStillMovingAutomation2019]] and [[reuse]] [[@blakeCollaborativeInformationSynthesis2006a]]
[[August 29th, 2020]]

- and thinking back to [[[[CLM]] - Effective individual synthesis systems (seem to mostly) exist (for a select few)]], what systems seem to fit the stronger claim so far?

    - [[sys/TinderBox]], as shown by [[Beck Tench]]

    - Paper

        - Inspired by [this thread](((9Fpzjz9oU))) (about a different topic, but wonderful #example-of [[[[CLM]] - Analog media are stubbornly effective for supporting creative knowledge work]] highly effective thinking on paper, freely mixing text, lists, sketches, fragmentary diagrams). Really reminds me of [[Darwin's notebooks]], and [[Multiplicity]] (in the modality sense

    - anything that effectively supports [[[[PTN]] - incremental formalization]] has a degree of this power, including [[sys/RoamResearch]], especially if the direction of change is not just one-way

    - and also systems that support a [[dialectic]] between [[compression]] and [[context]], between zooming in and zooming out

        - very much reminiscent of [[@qianOpeningBlackBox2020]] Scholars varied substantially in the [[ecology of tools]] used for [[synthesis]]: no single tool was used to encompass every (sub)task, and few tools were common across all scholars.
[[May 28th, 2020]]

- I'm now wondering if we need to transform the problem of [[WP: TOCHI Requirements framework for synthesis systems]] to the simpler case of "data models" for individual synthesis. And then once that is clear, think about how it might generalize to the sharing / collaborative case? I don't even know if we fully understand the **principles** for individual synthesis yet (might be a reason that #[[[[CLM]] - Effective individual synthesis systems (seem to mostly) exist (for a select few)]]: we don't have clear ways to decide, so other factors like convenience and marketing win, and people leave too much on the table). Let's solve that first, maybe?

    - Then we can add the 1+N case (collaborative, team), and see how the set of requirements changes.

        - We might ask: what (packages of) elements of individual synthesis are shareable? We know that [[[[CLM]] - Most private annotations aren't useful to other people]]

    - Then scale up to harder levels of [[reuse]]

    - Along these lines, we need to think very carefully about #[[Z: Sensemaking models partially model scholarly synthesis as of [[April 21st, 2020]]]] and #[[[[CLM]] - Synthesis is sensemaking on "hard mode"]], because that will probably be our first place to look to derive principles of the **data models** for systems that support synthesis.

        - Although efforts like #[[@russellBeingLiterateLarge2006]] and #[[@russellCostStructureSensemaking1993]] and #[[@pirolliSensemakingProcessLeverage2005]] seem to target more **__process__**-level frictions, and not as much the data model / artifacts themselves.

            - Slight exception from #[[@russellBeingLiterateLarge2006]]: Good example on p5: if "moving" a paper is costly, people do it a lot less
