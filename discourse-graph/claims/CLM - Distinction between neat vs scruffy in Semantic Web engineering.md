    - Description

        - [[@poirierTurnScruffyEthnographic2017]]'s ethnographic history of "schools of thought" in [[Semantic Web]] (including the various flavors of [[std/OWL]]), ((Us19hixA_)) Poirier makes the interesting claim that ((bZ8qfofmr))

        - Interestingly, this division is reminiscent of broad trends in [[reuse]] away from a formal [[repository model]] to a more "practice-oriented" approach to [[reuse]] (see, e.g., [[@ackermanSharingKnowledgeExpertise2013]]), motivated similarly by the complexities of real deployments. The "scruffy" style also resembles the ethos of [[[[PTN]] - incremental formalization]], which arose also in conversation with grappling with the failures of [[formality]] in real-world settings, as summarized in [[@shipmanFormalityConsideredHarmful1999]]

        - Per [feedback](Your personas are well described and offer generative examples - but these could be framed in the existing archetypes of the Semantic Web as a development community. I'm thinking here of the [[[[CLM]] - Distinction between neat vs scruffy in Semantic Web engineering]]. Your personas oftens straddle these divides and it might be worth thinking about this dichotomy when describing end-users / domain experts vs engineers. Some helpful pointers to relevant literature:") on our [[WP: JCDL Where the semantic publishing rubber meets the scholarly practice road]], we can think of our [[Explorers]], [[Virtuosos]], and [[Hackers]], as straddling divides between "neat" and "scruffy" thought styles in [[Semantic Web]] engineering, as described in [[@poirierTurnScruffyEthnographic2017]], and also [[Roger Schank]]

- another one for the [[dialectic]]: [[[[CLM]] - Distinction between neat vs scruffy in Semantic Web engineering]]

    - using this as a lens for thinking about / evaluating tools for [[synthesis]]:

        - weak claim: tools for synthesis should support different representations and styles of thinking

            - cf. [[[[CLM]] - Requirements for sensemaking come from the particulars of the work task]]

        - stronger claim: tools for synthesis should support "smooth" [[dialectic]] interactions / transitions between *opposing* representations and styles of thinking

            - intuitive vs. analytical

            - informal vs. formal

            - implicit vs. explicit

            - scruffy vs. neat

            - concrete vs. abstract

            - "soft" vs. "hard"

            - "right hemisphere" vs. "left hemisphere"

            - "hot" vs. "cold"

            - [[recontextualization]] vs. [[decontextualization]]

    - and thinking back to [[[[CLM]] - Effective individual synthesis systems (seem to mostly) exist (for a select few)]], what systems seem to fit the stronger claim so far?

        - [[sys/TinderBox]], as shown by [[Beck Tench]]

        - Paper

            - Inspired by [this thread](((9Fpzjz9oU))) (about a different topic, but wonderful #example-of [[[[CLM]] - Analog media are stubbornly effective for supporting creative knowledge work]] highly effective thinking on paper, freely mixing text, lists, sketches, fragmentary diagrams). Really reminds me of [[Darwin's notebooks]], and [[Multiplicity]] (in the modality sense

        - anything that effectively supports [[[[PTN]] - incremental formalization]] has a degree of this power, including [[sys/RoamResearch]], especially if the direction of change is not just one-way

        - and also systems that support a [[dialectic]] between [[compression]] and [[context]], between zooming in and zooming out

    - maybe there is an analogy here to interdisciplinary teams, where you get a TON of value from opposing teammates, and also [[adversarial collaborations]], but they need to be done "well". What does that look like? Is there something similar here with tools?

    - i'm still not 100% sure what the contribution here is, though. i'm feeling like it's a sort of framework or model or theoretical reflection (similar to the goal of [[WP: TOCHI Requirements framework for synthesis systems]])

        - does centering the goal of [[dialectic]] interactions change how we design systems?

- This reminds me very much of [[[[CLM]] - Distinction between neat vs scruffy in Semantic Web engineering]]

    - And challenges my thinking about wanting to parse out the "intrinsic quality" of an idea (cf. against [[reception penalties]] in discussions of [[[[QUE]] - How might domain distance modulate the effects of analogies on creative output?]])

        - Intuitively I want to parse it out, but it may actually be... inextricable?

            - It's not just that "worse is better" helps with reception, but... it's also "better" in some deeper sense of fitness and usefulness. Said another way, "the right thing" is right in some narrow sense, but actually wrong/worse in a broader collection of important senses.

        - That said, it is still possible to break out different senses of reception penalties: some are more related to [[[[CLM]] - Prestige substantially controls how scientific ideas spread]]
[[sysOpen Research Knowledge Graph]]

- much more on the [[formality]] and "neat" end of [[[[CLM]] - Distinction between neat vs scruffy in Semantic Web engineering]], i think - emphasis on [[machine readable]] as a core property

- In this way, we deliberately take a pragmatic or "[scruffy]([[[[CLM]] - Distinction between neat vs scruffy in Semantic Web engineering]])" stance towards [[ontologies]] and [[Semantic Web]], even though in broad strokes our goals might align

    - we are deliberately moving *away* from the particular vision of things being [[machine readable]] for the purpose of automating reasoning and [[synthesis]] (the original goal of [[Semantic Web]]), which has very important consequences for the way in which we approach modeling: after [[Amelia Acker]]'s provocative question "what do models want", models and ontologies that drive towards the goal of automated reasoning are driven towards [[compression]] that is lossy, that is flat and formal (cf. [[@shipmanFormalityConsideredHarmful1999]]) - in a sense, we must be careful with [[formality]] *on principle* if we wish to support creative work - a semblance of it is necessary to enable computer-augmented support, but we must be careful not to let the wishes of the model to dominate!

- Side note: this OG stuff reminds me very much of the [[[[CLM]] - Distinction between neat vs scruffy in Semantic Web engineering]] stuff as well as

    - This made me stumble back upon this thread: I want to sketch out some positive design requirements that seem to follow for now from this rich history of critiques in the philosophy of science:

        - Which I absolutely want to integrate into [[outline/[[D/Synthesis Infrastructure]] - discourse graphs paper]] in Design principles
[[August 10th, 2021]]

- There's something brewing in my head again about [[D/Synthesis Infrastructure]] that I think connects back to [[[[CL]] - Multiplicity is necessary for synthesis]] and my discomfort with [[formality]] and [[knowledge graph]]s. What I want to do is to build something positive, but I'm also well aware of the pitfalls of formality (e.g., as shown in the history of [[expert systems]] and [[knowledge management]] (see [this note](Interestingly, this division is reminiscent of broad trends in [[reuse]] away from a formal [[repository model]] to a more "practice-oriented" approach to [[reuse]] (see, e.g., [[@ackermanSharingKnowledgeExpertise2013]]), motivated similarly by the complexities of real deployments. The "scruffy" style also resembles the ethos of [[[[PTN]] - incremental formalization]], which arose also in conversation with grappling with the failures of [[formality]] in real-world settings, as summarized in [[@shipmanFormalityConsideredHarmful1999]]) from [[[[CLM]] - Distinction between neat vs scruffy in Semantic Web engineering]]).

    - We need a positive vision of what it looks like to [[build beyond the critique]]

    - In a way this also returns back to my [early musings](The stronger version of this is potentially [[standpoint theory]]. Amanda recommends [[@bardzellFeministHCITaking2010a]] as a canonical ref for feminist HCI; it's not the original source for standpoint theory, though.) on this from the idea of [[context]]

    - I want to sketch out some positive design requirements that seem to follow for now from this rich history of critiques in the philosophy of science:

        - Formality as special case, carefully, but always tied back to and grounded in informal discourse

        - Multiplicity and federation over universality

        - Machine-processable (possible for machines to help) over machine readable (computable in the strong sense: autonomous machine reasoning)

        - Dynamic, negotiated [[interoperability]] over enforced uniformity and standards

        - Simplicity of shared ontology with explicit eyes to local variations (cf. [[[[PTN]] - boundary object]]s)

    - Something about scruffiness feels unsatisfying. Almost like a return to Stage 3. But Stage 4, "machine readable", formal knowledge graphs is untenable as a general solution. Should there even be a general solution? How useful would it be to provide some kind of knowledge infrastructure that is different from books and papers and documents, between the disciplines? I think there is still a high potential for payoff. But I'm very mindful of the dragons: it's so remarkable how these same moments play out over and over and over again across different domains: from knowledge management to AI to cognitive science to philosophy of science to semantic web, over and over and over again, decade after decade

    - Some of these efforts are more formal, some less formal. I align most with the latter, but recognize the power of the former, particularly under appropriate circumstances, such as in ontology-rich areas like biomedical research.
