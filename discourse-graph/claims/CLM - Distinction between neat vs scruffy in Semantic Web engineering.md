    - Description

        - [[@poirierTurnScruffyEthnographic2017]]'s ethnographic history of "schools of thought" in [[Semantic Web]] (including the various flavors of [[std/OWL]]), ((Us19hixA_)) Poirier makes the interesting claim that ((bZ8qfofmr))

        - Interestingly, this division is reminiscent of broad trends in [[reuse]] away from a formal [[repository model]] to a more "practice-oriented" approach to [[reuse]] (see, e.g., [[@ackermanSharingKnowledgeExpertise2013]]), motivated similarly by the complexities of real deployments. The "scruffy" style also resembles the ethos of [[[[PTN]] - incremental formalization]], which arose also in conversation with grappling with the failures of [[formality]] in real-world settings, as summarized in [[@shipmanFormalityConsideredHarmful1999]]

        - Per [feedback](Your personas are well described and offer generative examples - but these could be framed in the existing archetypes of the Semantic Web as a development community. I'm thinking here of the [[[[CLM]] - Distinction between neat vs scruffy in Semantic Web engineering]]. Your personas oftens straddle these divides and it might be worth thinking about this dichotomy when describing end-users / domain experts vs engineers. Some helpful pointers to relevant literature:") on our [[WP: JCDL Where the semantic publishing rubber meets the scholarly practice road]], we can think of our [[Explorers]], [[Virtuosos]], and [[Hackers]], as straddling divides between "neat" and "scruffy" thought styles in [[Semantic Web]] engineering, as described in [[@poirierTurnScruffyEthnographic2017]], and also [[Roger Schank]]
