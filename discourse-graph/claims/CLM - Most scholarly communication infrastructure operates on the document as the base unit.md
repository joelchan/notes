    - Description

        - Even though we know that [[[[CLM]] - Scholarly argumentation operates on atomic statements and concepts as fundamental units]], our [[[[scholarly communication]] [[infrastructure]]]] doesn't make it easy for scholars to find and work with these units: far from it! In reality today, scholars spend a lot of time and effort "breaking down" more complex components like papers and books into the constituent building blocks they actually care about (heuristics, findings, claims, concepts, definitions).

        - This directly conflicts with the idea that [[[[CLM]] - Compression is necessary for synthesis]], and might be one reason that [[[[CLM]] - Effective synthesis is hard]]
