    - Description

        - Even though we know that [[[[CLM]] - Scholarly argumentation operates on atomic statements and concepts as fundamental units]], our [[[[scholarly communication]] [[infrastructure]]]] doesn't make it easy for scholars to find and work with these units: far from it! In reality today, scholars spend a lot of time and effort "breaking down" more complex components like papers and books into the constituent building blocks they actually care about (heuristics, findings, claims, concepts, definitions).

        - This directly conflicts with the idea that [[[[CLM]] - Compression is necessary for synthesis]], and might be one reason that [[[[CLM]] - Effective synthesis is hard]]

- Unfortunately, [[[[CLM]] - Most scholarly communication infrastructure operates on the document as the base unit]]

    - This is important, because, like [[Insight problem solving]], if [[chunk decomposition]] is harder, then the task of [[synthesis]] gets harder.

        - Scholars encounter a problem with "chunks" (papers, sources, etc.), either ones they have already, or ones they seek out.

        - They want to construct a new understanding. To do that, they need to decompose the chunk of the paper/source/chapter, etc. into the component parts they care about, to be able to manipulate them, combine them, move them around, etc. (cf. [[[[CLM]] - Scholarly argumentation operates on atomic statements and concepts as fundamental units]])

        - The source of difficulty for chunk decomposition in this case isn't necessarily the fact that the chunks are "tight" in the specific sense that Knoblich meant: that is, the components of the chunk *are* meaningful. It's just that the scholar has to "chisel" them out of the paper. It takes work!

        - But the point remains that having access to the chunks is important!
