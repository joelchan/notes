- on the basis of these results, the authors claim that timing, and specifically [[open goals]] determine [[[[QUE]] - What factors control whether people appropriately benefit from analogies (especially far-field ones) during creative problem solving?]]. Specifically, they claim that [[[[CLM]] - People are more likely to benefit from far analogies if they encounter them while they have an open goal - [[@tsengRoleTimingAnalogical2008]]]]

    - this finding has been replicated somewhat in our work with [[@siangliulueProvidingTimelyExamples2015]], although it is in tension with [[@kulkarniEarlyRepeatedExposure2012]]

    - this comes most from the work of [[@patalanoMemoryImpassesProblem1994]] [[@patalanoOpportunisticPlanningBeing1997]] and connects to the [[Zeigarnik effect]]

    - i think the more general claim here is that open goals can make it more likely that potentially beneficial stimuli will be noticed and processed in useful ways, even if there are normal barriers that might prevent this (such as in the case of far analogies, difficulties with mapping, etc.)
