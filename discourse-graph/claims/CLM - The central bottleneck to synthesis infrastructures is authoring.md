    - Description

        - This note is supposed to be a proposed explanation for a negative answer to the question [[[[QUE]] - Do scholarly synthesis infrastructures already exist?]]. I am still developing that claim, though. A deeper diagnosis of why I'm not seeing mainstream adoption of these synthesis [[infrastructure]]s yet can help ground our project more.

        - There are two parts to this:

            - #[[[[QUE]] - What is the user experience of dedicated semantic authoring?]]

            - #[[[[QUE]] - What is the user experience of semantic authoring within regular scholarly workflows?]]

            - [[[[CLM]] - Sustaining authorship for [[semantic publishing]] is hard]]

        - We can also talk about the metaphor that [the warehouses are built, but they're kind of empty](If we use the analogy of shipping [[infrastructure]], the warehouses have been built (standards, archives), and the delivery routes to people are mostly there (search engines), but the problem is that the warehouses are mostly empty. Nobody's using the standardized containers. They're just dumping stuff into the warehouse. So if you order a part, you sometimes get the part, but sometimes you get a car that you have to take apart to get the part, or maybe even the raw materials for the part, but not the part itself. We're building the ‚Äúmachinery‚Äù that is upstream of the warehouse, that equips people to make and package the right parts to put into the warehouse.).

            - "It turns out that all the technologies needed for applying genuine semantic publishing are already available and most of them are very mature and reliable. There are no __technical__ obstacles preventing us from releasing our results from today on as genuine semantic publications, even though more work is needed on ontologies that cover all relevant aspects and areas and on nice and intuitive end-user interfaces to make this process as easy as possible." (p. 148)

            - "There are no technical obstacles to this trajectory [towards enhanced literature and ontology-aware tools], and it is already under way" (p. 832)
