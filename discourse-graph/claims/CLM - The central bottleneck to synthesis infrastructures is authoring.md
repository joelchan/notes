    - Description

        - This note is supposed to be a proposed explanation for a negative answer to the question [[[[QUE]] - Do scholarly synthesis infrastructures already exist?]]. I am still developing that claim, though. A deeper diagnosis of why I'm not seeing mainstream adoption of these synthesis [[infrastructure]]s yet can help ground our project more.

        - There are two parts to this:

            - #[[[[QUE]] - What is the user experience of dedicated semantic authoring?]]

            - #[[[[QUE]] - What is the user experience of semantic authoring within regular scholarly workflows?]]

            - [[[[CLM]] - Sustaining authorship for [[semantic publishing]] is hard]]

        - We can also talk about the metaphor that [the warehouses are built, but they're kind of empty](If we use the analogy of shipping [[infrastructure]], the warehouses have been built (standards, archives), and the delivery routes to people are mostly there (search engines), but the problem is that the warehouses are mostly empty. Nobody's using the standardized containers. They're just dumping stuff into the warehouse. So if you order a part, you sometimes get the part, but sometimes you get a car that you have to take apart to get the part, or maybe even the raw materials for the part, but not the part itself. We're building the “machinery” that is upstream of the warehouse, that equips people to make and package the right parts to put into the warehouse.).

- Ok did about an hour of prototyping [[[[CLM]] - The central bottleneck to synthesis infrastructures is authoring]], spawned uncertainty about [[[[QUE]] - Do scholarly synthesis infrastructures already exist?]]

    - There are some very basic numbers I want to have in my head to think through things.

        - What is the coverage of major [[Semantic Web]]-style approaches for scholarly [[synthesis]] [[infrastructure]]?

            - A starting point is #[[@kuhnNanopublicationsGrowingResource2018]], which reports around 10 million [[std/Nanopublications]] published at the time of writing, albeit almost all within bioinformatics, and overwhelmingly dominated by a small (N=41!!) set of authors

            - Good question for [[Katrina Fenlon]]

        - What is the scale at which scientists are producing annotations and notes? In other words, what is the untapped opportunity here? What is the "drag coefficient"? How much energy is being "wasted'?

            - Analogy here to the [[cognitive surplus]] argument for crowdsourcing

    - Also need to be very precise about what I mean by [[[[QUE]] - Do scholarly synthesis infrastructures already exist?]]

        - [[std/Research Objects]] actually may not count, at least according to [[@kuhnGenuineSemanticPublishing2017]]

        - We need to go back and forth between the question of existence and the question of standards.

    - Important caution: even if the answer to the existence question is negative, it does not follow that the [[Authorship Bottleneck]] is the main thing in the sense that we are thinking of (e.g., it may not actually be *that* tedious; it's just that nobody is incentivized sufficiently to do it; that still would connect with the idea of [[[[PTN]] - Integrated crowdsourcing]] though)

- pulling on #[[[[CLM]] - The central bottleneck to synthesis infrastructures is authoring]]

    - #[[@grozaSALTWeavingClaim2007]] is major thread, has user study: as expected, simple things like rhetoric annotation are perceived (importantly, by 8 ppl familiar with [[Semantic Web]]) as easy/intuitive, but other more semantic stuff, not so much...

    - there's some analogous argumentation going on in the [[data curation]] world, about better connecting data publishing with where the data is actually generated

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FTad4fkFwz3.png?alt=media&token=3a652eee-3a05-40f9-9ecf-bb6c5cb81bb6)

    - dominant model for [[semantic publishing]] seems to still be "domain experts / scientists" separate from [[curator]]s, such as [[ontology engineers]]

        - need a new zettel to collate models of "authoring": #[[Z: Models of authoring for semantic publishing in scholarly communication infrastructures]]

        - cf. #[[[[QUE]] - What is the user experience of dedicated semantic authoring?]]

    - 17:40 OK so what did we learn about this thread from looking at #[[@grozaSALTWeavingClaim2007]] and browsing around (lots of tabs still open)

        - we now have ~2 studies showing that the act of [[compression]] is desirable and natural for **authors**

        - i haven't yet found any studies of integration of "semantic work" into workflows other than authoring and curation

            - cf. [[author contribution model of semantic publishing]] and [[specialized [[curator]] model of semantic publishing]]

        - we need to be very precise about what we mean by "semantic work" (the framework will help here)

        - there is a nice analogy to recent [[SOTA]] convos in [[data curation]]

            - there's some analogous argumentation going on in the [[data curation]] world, about better connecting data publishing with where the data is actually generated

- More on the thread of #[[[[CLM]] - The central bottleneck to synthesis infrastructures is authoring]]

    - another commentary in [[bioinformatics]] on how we can't expect authors of papers to write in formal ways. I like hte phrase, too, #> "why bury it first and then mine it again?", as a way to be skeptical of post-hoc text mining as the main thing to do. #[[@monsWhichGeneDid2005]]

        - correctly diagnoses that writing in a formal way (e.g., linking to established [[ontologies]]) is overly burdensome for authors BUT! still proposes that authors do a more lightweight version of it, with computer assistance

    - [[Katrina Fenlon]] mentions a review by Bucur et al - I think it's [[Christina-Iulia Bucur]]?? Working with [[Tobias Kuhn]], focusing (beginning with doctoral consortium piece in [[2018]], on integrating [[Semantic Web]] stuff into the [[peer review]] process)

        - #[[@bucurLinkflowsEnablingWeb2018]]

        - then more progress reported in #[[@bucurPeerReviewingRevisited2019]]

    - Also, an actual observational study focused on "non-expert" [[std/OWL]] users #[[R: dzborDevelopingOntologiesOWL2006]]
[[May 20th, 2020]]

- This actually has a similar research goal as the [[P: COVID-19 treatment search]], centered around the [[Authorship Bottleneck]] (cc. [[[[CLM]] - The central bottleneck to synthesis infrastructures is authoring]])

    - Some stuff also in [[Semantic Web]] basically echoing what [[Tobias Kuhn]] and [[Carole L. Palmer]] say: the obstacles that remain are not technological, in terms of the tech infrastructure (the standards): it's the "user experience"!

    - Reading again the [[CEDAR project]] (led by [[Mark Musen]], met at the [[AAAI TACOS symposium 2019]]): motivation and lessons are similar for [[open data]]: everyone knows science is better for it if data are shared with appropriate metadata, following [[FAIR principles]]. But uptake is low, except when there are extreme incentives. Some stuff I saw at [[iConference]] last year along this vein. See also [[@tenopirDataSharingScientists2011]]

        - The route we are thinking of is similar to what some are doing, like what we saw with the other Stanford folks, and the Netherlands person and [[sys/CodeOcean]]: basically make it so that the work you need to do to make something shareable and reproducible happens as a matter of course. [[[[PTN]] - Organize by using]]! Again, basically the route of [[[[PTN]] - Integrated crowdsourcing]]. To take advantage of this route, we need more than surveys or interviews: we need a deep dive detailed look into actual workflows as they play out, to identify points of friction but also integration. This is the argument for how we might tackle the [[Authorship Bottleneck]].

        - Now again, there is the alternate route of doing it via AI, completely autonomously. I'm not optimistic. We're struggling even for basic [[OpenIE]]. [[sys/Snorkel]] has some nice results in constrained domains for constrained tasks. But.. see also [[Jodi Schneider]]'s stuff on [[Argumentation Mining]] [[@stedeArgumentationMining2018]]

            - [[SOTA]] for extracting claims is quite low (~60ish percent) (p. 76)

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F_cUM0ccYHH.png?alt=media&token=d818d715-cc1c-4eab-b240-e9dea8eaaf13)

            - Highest performance is for very idiosyncratic domains - models that perform well on these domains do poorly when generalizing to other domains (p. 76)

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FilN0nw-mzv.png?alt=media&token=8a5ac151-ed75-4d21-9f43-76ce34ee1416)

        - In general, mandates are not strong enough medicine.

        - The other route that's often considered is individual incentives (rewarding scientists for doing it, counting in publications). This is true to a point. But it's a heavy lift: requires widespread cultural change, and might be chicken and egg.

- I think there is something here around the central argument of [[Authorship Bottleneck]]s - something like [[[[CLM]] - The central bottleneck to synthesis infrastructures is authoring]] - let's prototype this.

    - Ok did about an hour of prototyping [[[[CLM]] - The central bottleneck to synthesis infrastructures is authoring]], spawned uncertainty about [[[[QUE]] - Do scholarly synthesis infrastructures already exist?]]

        - There are some very basic numbers I want to have in my head to think through things.

    - Importantly, the question of [[[[QUE]] - Do scholarly synthesis infrastructures already exist?]] is separable from the question of [[Z: What are the core information standards for scholarly synthesis infrastructures?]]. I should be bopping back and forth between the two though.
