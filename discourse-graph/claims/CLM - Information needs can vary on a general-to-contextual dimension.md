    - Description

        - Foundational models of information seeking and behavior posit that context is an important factor in determining relevance of information

        - Developments on [[Contextual Search]]

        - But not all information is highly contextual. Some information is more general, in that contextual factors may not influence its relevance to a high degree. For instance, a fact like "permits are processed by the Department of X" tend to be quite stable over time and applicable across wide ranges of physical locations and across different kinds of information seekers.

        - Relevant also is ideas about [[metis]]

    - R-Sources

        - The idea that contextual factors influence what information is needed is a very old idea in information-seeking / behavior research (p.1) [[üìù lit-notes]]

            - Not necessarily a great primary source, but provides a nice overview of the idea of context from both an information behavior standpoint and an information retrieval standpoint. A brief look at the cites suggests it is reasonably well-grounded, with classics like Devin's work on sensemaking cited on the IB side.

        - great synthesis lecture on many different approaches to thinking about [[context]]
