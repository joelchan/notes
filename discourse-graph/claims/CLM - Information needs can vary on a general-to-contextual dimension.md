    - Description

        - Foundational models of information seeking and behavior posit that context is an important factor in determining relevance of information

        - Developments on [[Contextual Search]] in IR in response to this

        - But not all information is highly contextual. Some information is more general, in that contextual factors may not influence its relevance to a high degree. For instance, a fact like "permits are processed by the Department of X" tend to be quite stable over time and applicable across wide ranges of physical locations and across different kinds of information seekers.

        - Relevant also is ideas about [[metis]]. Some connections have been made between this idea about highly localized knowledge and the value/power of [[Participatory Design]]

    - R-Sources

        - The idea that contextual factors influence what information is needed is a very old idea in information-seeking / behavior research (p.1) #[[üìù lit-notes]] [[R: freundContextualSearchInformation2013]]

            - Not necessarily a great primary source, but provides a nice overview of the idea of context from both an information behavior standpoint and an information retrieval standpoint. A brief look at the cites suggests it is reasonably well-grounded, with classics like Devin's work on sensemaking cited on the IB side.

        - great synthesis lecture on many different approaches to thinking about [[context]], ranging from [[LIS]] to [[Context-Aware Computing]], and so on. Recognize citations in here from Abowd, [[Paul Dourish]], and others.[[@agarwalExploringContextInformation2017]]

        - #Claim An information seeker's context --- including things like work role, time constraints, and location --- can substantially shape the nature of her information need (p. 186-187) [[@robsonBuildingModelsInformation2013]]

    - Status:

        - {{[[DONE]]}} [[Joel Chan]] #[[TaskWrite]] #TaskNext flesh out more, with pointers to theoretical grounding in classic IB work and connections to IR contextual search stuff.
