    - Description:

        - Most models of [[🧱 sensemaking]] describe the process as an iterative cycling between (less processed) "data" and (synthesized) "[[Schema]]s"

        - For example, the [[Learning Loop Complex]] or [[Notional Model of Sensemaking]])

    - R-Sources

        - Introduces the [[Learning Loop Complex]] and idea of [[encodon]] as bridge between data and representations ([[Schema]]s)that are then used for downstream tasks during [[🧱 sensemaking]] (p. 271) [[@russellCostStructureSensemaking1993]]

        - [[Notional Model of Sensemaking]] in intelligence analysis has a looping structure that loops both between and within foraging and sensemaking loops, and progressively increases in both structure and effort, starting from raw data sources and culminating in a synthesized set of hypotheses #[[📝 lit-notes]] (p3) [[@pirolliSensemakingProcessLeverage2005]]
