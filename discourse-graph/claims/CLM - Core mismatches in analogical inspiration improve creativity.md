    - Description

        - "Stretching" on attributes is an important way to achieve abstraction, as shown in [[@gilonAnalogyMiningSpecific2018]]

            - Motivation for the [[sysFOCAB]]

        - some notes on this in our [[analogy workshop with Bex's lab in 2017]]

            - here is something I wrote to [[Benjamin Reinhardt]]

                - Re: your question about eliciting hidden assumptions/constraints, one strategy we've found that is quite effective is to have an interactive conversation with (analogical) inspirations about a problem: we've had situations where one of us played a "useful fool" role of suggesting things that might be useful, but in a nonthreatening enough way that the scientist could reject it or think through it, and often this led them to drop previously hidden assumptions, or discover implicit assumptions that are important. You can take a look at this notes doc we kept while doing something like this with a mechE research lab (J = me, N = Niki Kittur, my postdoc advisor), jamming over inspirations for stretchable actuators at small (nano?) scales:Â https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-shjMif_2UBBmxq2sD6CaBoGsvux449_X1ewz3NZnQ0/edit?usp=sharingÂ - we've also seen this anecdotally in most of hte real-world instances where we've deployed some versions of our systems, where the value of the analogies is often in the provocation of a restructuring of the problem, not (just) the provision of an actual workable solution.

            - ex: nanoscale, heat transfer between different materials

            - other examples

            - importantly, he also found that many of the interesting insights coudl come from pushing through and working through these misalignments. we've since called this idea [[generative misalignment]]

        - Designers used an [[analogy]]

        - Something from [[@holyoakMentalLeapsAnalogy1996]]

            - #quotes "â€¦an interesting trade-off emerges between the completeness of an analogy and its usefulness in generating inferences. The more complete the initial correspondences are between source and target, the more confident you can be that the two are in fact isomorphic. But unless you know more about one analog than the other - in other words, unless the initial correspondences between source and target propositions are incomplete - the mapping will not allow any new inferences to be made. A complete isomorphism has nothing to be filled in, leaving no possibility for creative leaps." (p. 30)

            - it's a model, no empirical results in the paper, other than references to prior phenomena

            - but the process laid out here dovetails nicely with what is observed in [[@helmsCompoundAnalogicalDesign2008]]

        - Partial purpose matches (high level purpose match, but not low level purpose match) mediating the positive benefits of analogy --> maybe modeling and matching on low-level purposes is both infeasible/hard AND undesirable?
