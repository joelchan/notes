    - Description

        - Related to the idea of [[[[PTN]] - Integrated crowdsourcing]]

        - Also related to idea from [[sys/Zettelkasten]] (cc. [[@ahrensHowTakeSmart2017]]) on the need to tag by context of use, not as  "taxonomy" (cc )

            - Principle #8: Organize your notes by context, not by topic
