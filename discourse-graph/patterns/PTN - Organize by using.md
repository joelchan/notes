    - Description

        - Related to the idea of [[[[PTN]] - Integrated crowdsourcing]]

        - Also related to idea from [[sys/Zettelkasten]] (cc. [[@ahrensHowTakeSmart2017]]) on the need to tag by context of use, not as  "taxonomy" (cc )

            - Principle #8: Organize your notes by context, not by topic

- But more powerfully, allows me to tag in the context of lit-notes, and then pull up papers that discuss X (could be concepts, could be zettels). This is far more natural a way to formalize content and associate with a paper than trying to tag stuff ahead of time, out of [[context]] (following [[[[PTN]] - Organize by using]])

    - {{query: {and: [[references]] [[ðŸ§± cost structure]]}}}

    - Seems also like an #example-of [[[[PTN]] - incremental formalization]]

    - Now also thinking of that one book on library of congress and [[@ adlerCruisingLibraryPerversities2017]] has a wonderful #example-of the profound consequences of seemingly mundane [[Classification]] decisions (i.e., [[infrastructure]]). They're focused on the consequences for social justice, but the consequences for siloing knowledge and contributing to [[Scatter]] (because of hte nature of a filing/classification system) are plain to me too.

- Really cool #example-of [[AR]]-powered [[[[PTN]] - Organize by using]]: create new groupings on the fly of books (instead of fixed catalog placements) based on how patrons are using collections of books for their own research. Can even add these collections back to the catalog!
