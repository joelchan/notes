- The deeper insight of our grant and approach is about [[[[PTN]] - enabling environment]]s, I think!

    - [[groupware]] not necessarily focused on interdisciplinary teams, and definitely not for science - though maybe design was

        - Important exception that we build on: [[Gerhard Fischer]]'s stuff, though again that was not for science - was targeting communities of interest. His name keeps coming up, need to collect his stuff. It's not just [[@ariasEnvisionmentDiscoveryCollaboratory2015]]

            - Core insight from here is about the "[[domain-specific language (DSL)]]"

                - key paper was [[@fischerTurningBreakdownsOpportunities1994]] articulating this insight

                - embedded in larger project described in [[@fischerSocialCreativityTurning2004]] for fostering [[communities of interest]]

    - Separately, we have [[science of team science]] that focuses more on process-level factors, but not necessarily innovating on the artifact front

    - We're synthesizing these two lines of work and building on them to design enabling environments specifically for rapid interdisciplinary peer synthesis

        - Why rapid? Try to target the overhead of convergence [[[[CLM]] - Interdisciplinary teamwork is hard]]

            - reminds me of how [[synthesis centers]] struggle to keep afloat [[@baronSynthesisCentersCritical2017]], and the [[leeway]] needed to sustain [[interdisciplinarity]] ([[@palmerWorkBoundariesScience2001]])
