    - Description

        - In combo with [[[[PTN]] - Prefer to grow rather than "build / design" new infrastructures a priori]]

    - R-Sources

        - #[[@gentilePersonalizedKnowledgeGraphs2019]]

            - Key motivation for augmenting existing PDFs __in situ__, instead of extracting elements: preserve ability to get [[context]]!

- I agree with the basic point, cc [[[[PTN]] - Prefer to accrete new infrastructures on top of existing ones]], that:

    - > ...I'm not thinking of a radically new design for chat. I prefer an incremental, familiar form, but with the **affordances** we need to break free of the linearized world

        - And I'd add to that, not just linearized, but de[[context]]ualized, flattened, atomic world. Like [[@jollyFlatlandFallacyMoving2019]]

- Also: concretely, we're probably going to focus much more on creating "enhancements of" familiar interfaces and tool categories, concretely instantiated in things like plugins and APIs, and much less so standalone tools, very much in the spirit of [[[[PTN]] - Prefer to accrete new infrastructures on top of existing ones]]

- Thinking also again about [[[[PTN]] - Prefer to accrete new infrastructures on top of existing ones]]: where is the current best point of entry for small businesses?

    - Seems like it's the [[SBDC]]

        - Already a clear onboarding path

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FKgnuz3RmN7.png?alt=media&token=e7f4ea7f-4211-470b-b8e8-57bc1cc466a8)

        - And an [onboarding process](http://www.mdsbdc.umd.edu/locations/corridor-region/smart-start-corridor-region) for new businesses that include a list of common "funnel" points (e.g., have you already made a business plan?)

        - That is [[context]]ualized

        - With updated "[pamphlets/guides](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EAS90feseZIOXDzVbNJ1wgqkNjcNpQJzGRTAy1mUjFc/edit#heading=h.vukoosg3nios)" with rich [application-level]([[Z: Businesses often need information that is more application-oriented than libraries provide]]) information

- Reading again this quote in #[[@edwardsUnderstandingInfrastructureDynamics2007]] while thinking about #[[[[PTN]] - Prefer to accrete new infrastructures on top of existing ones]] - I think the moment we are in for #[[D/Synthesis Infrastructure]] is somewhere in the [[gateway phase of infrastructure growth]]

    - ((wnYrcu9lY))

    - We have lots of useful systems (e.g., [[hypertext notebooks]], [[[[QUE]] - Do scholarly synthesis infrastructures already exist?]]), but there isn't really yet any critical mass of linking them, at least in the sense of the [[scholar-powered model of semantic publishing]]
