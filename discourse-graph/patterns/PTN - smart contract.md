- [[[[PTN]] - smart contract]]s might provide an intriguing way to integrate the social (voting, governance) with the technical (computing over credence, etc., but not "hard"/alone) to synthesize across syntheses

    - could be a way to do something like living literature reviews in a decentralized, (semi)-autonomous way, as an alternative to expensive and lossy consensus meetings (a la National Academy)

    - helpful analogy to explain the concept of smart contracts (to me they're basically mini-programs that can be stacked together to form a [[DAO]])

        - > Smart contracts were first [proposed](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/idea.html) in the 1990s by a computer scientist and lawyer named Nick Szabo. Szabo famously compared a smart contract to a vending machine. Imagine a machine that sells cans of soda for a quarter. If you put a dollar into the machine and select a soda, the machine is hardwired to either produce your drink and 75 cents in change, or (if your choice is sold out) to prompt you to make another selection or get your dollar back. This is an example of a simple smart contract. Just like a soda machine can automate a sale without a human intermediary, smart contracts can automate virtually any kind of exchange.
