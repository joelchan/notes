            - "Since infrastructures are incremental and modular, they are always constructed in many places (the local), combined and recombined (the modular), and they take on new meaning in both different times and spaces (the contextual). Better, then, to deploy a vocabulary of "growing", "fostering", or "encouraging" in the evolutionary sense when analyzing cyberinfrastructure." (p. 7)
