    - Description

        - In part because [[[[CLM]] - Infrastructure is sociotechnical, not just technical]], and "Speaking of cyberinfrastructure as a machine to be built or a technical system to be designed tends to downplay the importance of social, institutional, organizational, legal, cultural, and other non-technical problems developers always face...Hence this report turns away from a language of design and engineering, reframing the discussion in a more organic lexicon." (p. 7) [[@edwardsUnderstandingInfrastructureDynamics2007]]

            - Need to "grow" an infrastructure, not design it a priori, for it to be successful (p. 369)

            - Summarizes thoughts from [[@edwardsUnderstandingInfrastructureDynamics2007]], which is itself a workshop report. Still need to dig into the cases. It's probably in the book?

            - "Since infrastructures are incremental and modular, they are always constructed in many places (the local), combined and recombined (the modular), and they take on new meaning in both different times and spaces (the contextual). Better, then, to deploy a vocabulary of "growing", "fostering", or "encouraging" in the evolutionary sense when analyzing cyberinfrastructure." (p. 7)
