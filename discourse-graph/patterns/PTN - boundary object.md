- Concept of [[punctuated crystallization]]: [[[[PTN]] - boundary object]]s that exist within information flows in organizations that get "crystallized" into temporary static artifacts. To understand object, must understand its place in the flow of information/work, past and future, and how it changes.

- re-reading [[@starInstitutionalEcologyTranslations1989]] and recalling the [core motivation](per [[[[PTN]] - boundary object]]s, meant to strike a balance between the extremes of [too much](((L5b1tSbi2))) and [too little](((i0p-3Ud6n))) structure) of [[[[PTN]] - boundary object]]s for the [[[[PTN]] - discourse graph]]'s design; in particular, of the four types of boundary objects they identified in the Museum, the "ideal type" seems to fit the most:

    - > This is an object such as a diagram, atlas or other description which in fact does not accurately describe the details of any one locality or thing. It is abstracted from all domains, and maybe fairly vague. However, it is adaptable to a local site precisely because it is fairly vague; ^^it serves as a means of communicating and cooperating symbolically- a 'good enough' road map for all parties^^. An example of an ideal type is the species. This is a concept which in fact described no specimen, which incorporated both concrete and theoretical data and which served as a means of communicating across both worlds. Ideal types arise with differences in degree of abstraction. They result in the deletion of local contingencies from the common object and have the advantage of adaptability. ([[@starInstitutionalEcologyTranslations1989]], p. 410)

    - our field studies have made clear that people desire a lot more local control and fine-grained nuance in their local models. yet these distinctions may not always be relevant or understandable to others.

    - our core motivation is not just local, individual synthesis, but a protocol that can respect [[epistemological diversity]], and facilitate cross-talk and synthesis across disciplines

    - the "paper" is a good boundary object on some notes, but when translated locally begins to run afoul of a lot of the contextual requirements

- Another principle: something deeper than [[interoperability]], but really leaning into the concept of [[[[PTN]] - boundary object]]s: weak structure in common use, but strong (and variable) structure in local use

- The argument in this paper is that [[[[PTN]] - boundary object]]s (e.g., CAD drawings, site visits, ) played an important role in facilitating knowledge transfer across organizational boundaries (e.g., between design and manufacturing engineers)

- To connect back to [[[[PTN]] - boundary object]]s, [[knowledge graph]]s with atomic concepts as nodes feels closer to classical formal [[ontologies]], which make strong assumptions about what should be in/out of the model. This is a SPECIAL CASE of reality! THE MODAL case is ambiguity and variation: it is perhaps for this reason that (effective) [[[[PTN]] - boundary object]]s are weakly structured in common use, and only strongly structured in local use

    - See also:

        - Constant themes in [[ASIST 2020 Conceptual Modeling Workshop]] of how it's tricky to draw boundaries and say "these are the same" (e.g., [here](((r8R6A2mgd))) and [here](((1WmT_5umb))) and [here](((YY3Kk7zMj))) and [here](((l9FWWyIKt))) and [here](((NRC6L8-Zf)))), which is what we try to do with [[ontologies]] and formal models

        - "Meta-rationality treats all categories as inherently purpose-laden—including scientific categories. It rejects the rationalist ideal of perfectly disinterested Truth. Any useful categorization of solar system objects would group them according to a sub-discipline’s interests. Dynamicists and astrobiologists would naturally come up with different ones. Meta-rationality accepts, applies, and coordinates multiple ontologies for a single domain. There isn’t a great example in our solar system, but astrobiologists exploring other star systems might need to take dynamical considerations into account. Hopefully they would have no difficulty holding both classification schemes in their heads at once. Investigating the ruins of an ancient civilization on an unusual natural object in the Alpha Centauri system, they should not get sucked into arguments about whether it is “really” a planet."

- was cited in [[hinds and pfeffer 2001]] to support the idea that [[[[PTN]] - boundary object]]s could be a way to overcome cognitive barriers to knowledge transfer (particularly tacit knowledge)

- [[Cynefin model]] (see [[@snowdenComplexActsKnowing2002]]) is entry point into [[Knowledge Management]] lit that echoes a lot of what was described in [[@ackermanSharingKnowledgeExpertise2013]], but from a (very? no citations of [[David Snowden]] at all in ackerman) different lineage, a lot running through knowledge management proper, and involving other canonical ideas like the [[SECI model]] and this influential [[Cynefin model]] from [[David Snowden]], less so [[[[PTN]] - boundary object]]s and the like from CSCW.

    - This stuff is actually hugely foundational, for both [[D/KNEXT]] and [[D/Synthesis Infrastructure]]. In some ways, a core defining concern of mine is [[Knowledge Management]] for creative work. And [[D/Synthesis Infrastructure]] is really about [[Knowledge Management]] but for scientific discovery and [[synthesis]]?

- In short, a [[[[PTN]] - boundary object]]!

    - It's been shown to facilitate coordination across boundaries (see review from [[@huvilaBoundaryObjectsInformation2017]], although see cautions from [[@leighstarThisNotBoundary2010]]). more stuff from [[Gerhard Fischer]] too [[@ariasEnvisionmentDiscoveryCollaboratory2015]].

    - And has been extended to the idea of design artifacts as boundary objects to facilitate [[multivoicedness]]: Design success may not involve convergence to "unite the many voices of design into one"; rather, the goal might be to find a way to let many voices live in tension and conversation, without premature resolution.  [[@bodkerDesignCollaboratoriumPlace2002]]

        - This relates very well to [[@strikeTypesSynthesisTheir1983]]'s criterion of synthesis as clarifying, but not necessarily resolving, underlying differences in material synthesized!

- this reminds me of the usefulness of [[[[PTN]] - boundary object]]s as connective tissue between disparate worlds: ill-structured in common use, strongly structured in local use

    - wrote about this on [[January 25th, 2021]]: To connect back to [[[[PTN]] - boundary object]]s, [[knowledge graph]]s with atomic concepts as nodes feels closer to classical formal [[ontologies]], which make strong assumptions about what should be in/out of the model.

[[December 1st, 2019]]

- And the idea of "weakly structured in common use, strongly structured in local use" of [[[[PTN]] - boundary object]]

    - Are papers weakly or strongly structured? From one perspective, they are quite strongly structured: it's hard to break it apart and remix parts of it inherently. On the other hand, they're large enough with distinct enough sections that you can sort of cherry pick?

- Prices in markets as [[[[PTN]] - boundary object]]s and [[synthesis]], aggregating only the necessary information that is distributed across actors, and made available to individual actors to make (approximately) rational economic choices

    - [[@hayekUseKnowledgeSociety1945]]
[[November 3rd, 2020]]

- framed in this way, both [[analogy]] and our [[[[PTN]] - discourse graph]] stuff can be seen as quite distinct from "raw materials" (in the sense of being raw inputs into some combination process), and more as [[[[PTN]] - boundary object]]s that facilitate coordination and collaboration for [interdisciplinary]([[interdisciplinarity]]) work

    - this implies a quite expansive view of "how do we measure success", beyond the scope of an individual writing session or project, even, but examining broader impacts on navigating the network, professional identity and emotion, and so on

        - [[@palmerWorkBoundariesScience2001]]'s concept of [[leeway]] helps us see the broader picture
[[October 21st, 2021]]

- [[[[PTN]] - boundary object]]s?

    - [[context]] is especially important for [[synthesis]] when navigating [[interdisciplinarity]]: what is usually subtext is now hidden entirely (since [[[[CLM]] - Substantial portions of knowledge that is critical for innovation are not written down]]), yet must also become front and center as the researcher needs to figure out whether and how ideas transfer from one setting to another.
