- Basic idea: (mostly) informal entry of information, then defer formalization until later in the task when it is useful
- Key advantages:

    - Reduce initial overhead of entering information

    - Reduce risk of harm from prematurely committing to the "wrong" structure
- Examples of incremental formalization

    - In the [[sysHyper-Object Substrate (HOS) system]]

    - Infoscope is a news reader system that suggests filters based on users' reading patterns; this helps them make their goals explicit which can facilitate formalization after it emerges from their task behaviors (p. 347-348)

    - VIKI is a spatial hypertext system that includes heuristic algorithms to find recurring visual/spatial patterns in layout of objects; users can use these to specify schemas if they wish
