“…Our results also confirm and extend findings for PIM described in the literature review, which indicate that neither desktop search nor collaborator folders are viable alternatives to active user-foldering. Consistent with other work (Barreau and Nardi, 1995; Boardman and Sasse, 2004; Capra and Pérez-Quiñones, 2005; Kirk et al , 2006; Teevan et al , 2004; Fitchett and Cockburn, 2015), we found that even before the use of our add-on participants clearly preferred navigation to search for retrieval. The use of our add-on increased storage in participant folders, which in turn reduced the use of search by half.…”

----------------------------------------------------------------
“…Such a difference between one‐time users and return users indicates that when users got more experience and became more familiar with the system, they would be willing to do browsing to locate the particular information they need. This result corresponds to previous studies that have documented that many users “orienteer” to results rather than “teleport” (Stenmark & Jadaan, ; Teevan et al, [ref]).…”

“…This result echoes Wang et al ([ref])’s field study finding that when users spent more efforts on carefully examining search results, they usually encounter less search obstacles and problems. In addition, our finding empirically confirms the underlying connections between adjacent local steps of Web search identified in previous IIR studies (e.g., Liu, Mitsui et al, [ref]; Teevan, Alvarado, Ackerman, & Karger, [ref]) and highlights the importance of leveraging the existing signals from search interactions to proactively identify future opportunities for task‐based system support and intervention. With respect to user persuasion and education, the answer to RQ1 also supports Liu, Wang, Mandal, and Shah ([ref])’s argument that encouraging deeper, fully engaged search interaction (through explicit intervention or intelligent nudging) is critical for a search system to improve users' task performances and search experiences.…”

- now, to support signals of, retrieval of, etc.? yeah, maybe.... but need to respect more of an [[[[PTN]] - Orienteering]] thing, rather than a targeted retrieval thing. there's just no way to get to an exact match, it's not in the cards
