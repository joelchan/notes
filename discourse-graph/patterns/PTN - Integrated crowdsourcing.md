    - Description

        - instead of having people do a laborious secondary task that is valuable for others (e.g., semantic judgments), seamlessly integrate that task into a primary task that people are already intrinsically motivated to do

        - some notable #example-of

            - [[@siangliulueIdeaHoundImprovingLargescale2016]]

            - and [[Juho Kim]]'s [[learnersourcing]] stuff

                - direct application of [[computational wear]] [[@hillEditWearRead1992]] for understanding video engagement in MOOCs here [[@kimUnderstandingInvideoDropouts2014]] and here [[@kimDatadrivenInteractionTechniques2014]]

                - then expanded to different interactions within the same application domain, to support construction of subgoals

                    - [[@kimCrowdsourcingStepbystepInformation2014]]

            - related line with [[Steven P. Dow]], dubbed [[communitysourcing]] or [[authorsourcing]]

- Introduces idea of [[[[PTN]] - Integrated crowdsourcing]]: instead of having people do a laborious secondary task that is valuable for others (e.g., semantic judgments), seamlessly integrate that task into a primary task that people are already intrinsically motivated to do

    - Could be a powerful pattern to apply for [[[[QUE]] - How can we best bridge private vs. public knowledge?]]: use private stuff as grist for **computing** something that is shared in a useful way, instead of sharing private stuff directly.

        - Long-range analogy to [[Preparation for Future Learning]]?

    - In collaborative brainstorming with virtual whiteboards, clustering of ideas (post-its) is a natural behavior that is intrinsically useful for the task. [[sys/Ideahound]] integrated semantic judgment work into this by providing "boxes" for users to use as containers for clusters, and building a semantic model of the space based on how post-its clustered together. This semantic model allowed for more intelligent recommendation of diverse examples, as well as visual overviews of the evolving design space.

        - intentionally messy on purpose

        - but there is some structure on horizontal axis

        - this seems related to [[[[EXP]] - [[D/Solution-Diversity]] - exploring presentation interaction effects on mechanism of inspiration from diverse examples]]
