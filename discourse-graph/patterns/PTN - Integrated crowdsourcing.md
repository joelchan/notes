    - Description

        - instead of having people do a laborious secondary task that is valuable for others (e.g., semantic judgments), seamlessly integrate that task into a primary task that people are already intrinsically motivated to do

        - some notable #example-of

            - [[@siangliulueIdeaHoundImprovingLargescale2016]]

            - and [[Juho Kim]]'s [[learnersourcing]] stuff

                - direct application of [[computational wear]] [[@hillEditWearRead1992]] for understanding video engagement in MOOCs here [[@kimUnderstandingInvideoDropouts2014]] and here [[@kimDatadrivenInteractionTechniques2014]]

                - then expanded to different interactions within the same application domain, to support construction of subgoals

                    - [[@kimCrowdsourcingStepbystepInformation2014]]

            - related line with [[Steven P. Dow]], dubbed [[communitysourcing]] or [[authorsourcing]]

                - [[@andreCommunityClusteringLeveraging2013]]

                - [[@chiltonFrenzyCollaborativeData2014]]

        - related to: [[[[PTN]] - Organize by using]], [[computational wear]], [[[[PTN]] - incremental formalization]], [[[[PTN]] - Prefer to accrete new infrastructures on top of existing ones]]
