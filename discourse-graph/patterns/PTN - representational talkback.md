- for my part, it's the "hiding", the lack of [[[[PTN]] - representational talkback]] - there is a lot more vitality under each note than is apparent from its presentation

    - #[[Question]] what new affordances might emerge from having a context-rich data structure?
[[March 7th, 2021]]

- I've been trying to get at this idea in the past in terms of ideas like the [[dialectic]] and [[[[PTN]] - representational talkback]] and [[Reflective Conversation with the Design Material]] and [[dance between the theoretical and the evidential]]: this is what I want my "notes" to be and do for me.

        - What kind of medium could this work in? Could do some creative things with [[AR]] maybe?

        - What "data structures" are necessary for these interactions to be possible? Could a fully fleshed out [[std/Micropublication]] with rich context be expressive enough for this?

    - Little nugget for the [[dialectic]] [[dance between the theoretical and the evidential]]: theory without data (or overly lossy [[compression]] that is disconnected from [[context]]) can be thought of as [[armchair speculation]] [*](Little nugget for the [[dialectic]] [[dance between the theoretical and the evidential]]: theory without data (or overly lossy [[compression]] that is disconnected from [[context]]) can be thought of as [[armchair speculation]])

    - Reflecting more on my process. The more I put things into Roam in the form of zettels and micropubs, the more I feel like I'm able to "[talk to the problem]([[Reflective Conversation with the Design Material]])", get back to basics... trust the process. And the less I feel like I'm spinning my wheels or rehashing shallow thoughts that seem good in the absence of data. Ideas also start to take more form and I can get a better sense of how hard/soft they are. [*](Reflecting more on my process.

        - without this adequate externalization, i feel like things ossify too quickly

            - feel this also when i review papers: often have a general gut sense that something is "known" or "has been demonstrated", but i can't really point to anything specific, and what does come to mind often doesn't really make the case adequately

                - this is a disservice to the field, and probably often prematurely cuts off or stifles lines of inquiry

            - i think this is also a very common grad student fear: oh no, someone's done this already! but have they really? like, Really solved the problem? or answered the question exactly?

                - probably partly this is in response to dynamics of reviewing as well

        - again, this to me is underscoring how far-reaching the impacts of having something like our [[D/Synthesis Infrastructure]] [[[[PTN]] - discourse graph]] could be for fixing [problems with science]([[[[CLM]] - Science is getting less bang for its buck]])!

- A serious limitation of [[sys/RoamResearch]] is the friction of moving to nonverbal / visual modalities of exploration. While [[[[CL]] - Visual thinking interfaces are tricky to get right]], most serious work probably has to move between verbal and nonverbal (less propositional?) modalities of representation: the holy grail is being able to move between the two (incidentally this is what [[sys/Liquid:Author]] can do, and is anticipated by the idea of [[[[PTN]] - representational talkback]] introduced in [[@yamamotoRepresentationalTalkbackApproach1998]]), and strongly related to this idea of [[Reflective Conversation with the Design Material]] and [co-evolution of design and problem space]( [[[[CLM]] - Design proceeds by co-evolution of problem and solution space]])

    - [[sys/RoamResearch]] does have some workarounds, like being able to paste in screenshots of sketches, and specifying diagrams (e.g., via [[sys/Mermaid diagrams]]) or tables from text, but the moving between isn't as fluid as I'd like, and the messy sketches in particular feel "inert" and unable to interact on equal terms with the rest of the content (e.g., can't add pages post-hoc, block ref, etc.)

        - maybe some kind of interaction overlay on top of pasted in screenshots could do the trick? or in-built "layers" (not very unlike layers in photoshop and most image editing software, and how on paper you only really have soft "mutability" via layering on top, and some with erasing)

    - Beyond the cognitive consequences of this interaction / modality limitation, the highly textual and nonvisual nature of this interface can be an unnecessary turnoff for many users who like visual interfaces
