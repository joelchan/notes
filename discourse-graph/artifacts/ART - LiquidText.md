- [[[[ART]] - LiquidText]] is a tool that supports active reading with a novel multi-touch interface.

    - A key feature for us is the ability to “pull out” and make sense of key excerpts, and make connections between excerpts and thoughts across papers

    - it’s almost wholly within the Apple ecosystem atm (but they're working on a windows version rn).

    - I think we can get a similar feel of fluidity without being bound directly to the multitouch interactions

    - Also from a CHI paper #[[@tashmanActiveReadingIts2011]], so technically overlaps with academic system subset

    - Interface-wise, I think this system is the best

- This approach is different from [[[[ART]] - LiquidText]] and other "integrated" systems in that:

    - It will involve a much more sophisticated and focused approach to supporting [[context]]

    - It will explicitly emphasize *not* being an integrated solution, but rather focus on integrations __with__ others, per [[[[PTN]] - Prefer to accrete new infrastructures on top of existing ones]]

- In [[[[ART]] - LiquidText]]

    - Note: this is interesting because [[[[ART]] - LiquidText]] explicitly builds on the deep work in [[active reading]]

- illustrative: failures of [[[[PTN]] - flexible compression]] with our [[sys/NVIVO]] and [[[[ART]] - LiquidText]] users, from [[John Morabito]]'s [recent analysis](identifying information reuse events in [[WP: Context Capture Process Patterns and Tool Affordances]], specifically looking for number of clicks to context and time to find context [did first context event for p1 and watched part 1 of p2 and p5])

    - also indicates that more [[context]] is needed!
