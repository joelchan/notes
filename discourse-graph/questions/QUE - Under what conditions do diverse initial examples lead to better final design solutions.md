- # Synthesis

    - [[Playground: Diverse examples]]

    - ^^**variations in scaffolded interactions with examples**^^, first need to flesh out [[[[THE]] - interaction-oriented theory of creative inspiration from examples]]

    - variations in Designer attributes

        - **Propensity/capacity to explore:** [[[[CLM]] - people with lower propensity or capacity to explore benefit *less* from diverse information during ideation]]

            - Something in here about local vs. global focus

            - Some [evidence for this]([[SupportedBy]]):

                - [[[[EVD]] - Only small business owners with high divergent thinking ability generated more ideas with diverse (vs. constrained) stimuli - [[@gielnikCreativityOpportunityIdentification2011]]]]

                - [[[[EVD]] - Only small business owners with high divergent thinking ability generated more original ideas with diverse (vs. constrained) stimuli - [[@gielnikCreativityOpportunityIdentification2011]]]]

            - Possible [counter-evidence]([[Opposed By]]):

                - [[[[EVD]] - case-based reasoning system loaded with diverse cases increased overall novelty of ad campaign ideas, but only for people with lower creative ability - [[@althuizenSupportingCreativeProblem2014]]]]

                    - note: here the comparison is to nothing, not low diversity

        - **Cross-comparison:** [[[[CL]] - people with less ability to cross-compare across multiple stimuli benefit less from diverse information during ideation]]

            - Something in here about recommendations vs. maps

            - Some indirect [evidence for this]([[SupportedBy]]) from studies of parallel prototyping

                - [[[[EVD]] - Designers who prototyped designs in parallel generated more diverse designs compared to designers who prototyped serially - [[@dowParallelPrototypingLeads2010]]]]

                - [[[[EVD]] - Final advertisements from designers who prototyped designs in parallel performed better on advertising analytics compared to ads from designers who prototype designs serially - [[@dowParallelPrototypingLeads2010]]]]

    - General effects of diversity

        - "far" > "close" conceptual combinations wrt novelty (and sometimes creativity) (lots of this from the psych lit)

            - [[[[EVD]] - Design students generated more creative web service ideas when combining interdomain web service examples, compared to intradomain examples - [[@zengFosteringCreativityProduct2011]]]]

        - if low diversity --> more within category [[[[EVD]] - groups generated more ideas within categories when individuals were given high-related (vs. low-related) categories - [[@baruahCategoryAssignmentRelatedness2011]]]]

        - if high diversity --> more across categories [[[[EVD]] - groups given low-related categories of solutions ended up exploring more categories in their solutions compared to high-related category groups - [[@baruahCategoryAssignmentRelatedness2011]]]]

    - Problem space characteristics

        - ‚ÄúShape‚Äù of the design space

            - Convexity (smooth/continuous ‚Üí rugged)

            - Continuous vs. discrete

        - Legibility

            - ‚ÄúTreeness‚Äù/procedureness (can you evaluate the ‚Äúdesign‚Äù at any point in time?) -

                - Heterogeneity of a design "move"

                    - cf. [[@helmsCompoundAnalogicalDesign2008]] [[@sosaAccretionTheoryIdeation2019]]

                - [[task/Truss Design]] is an #example-of a design problem that violates this assumption

            - Is your reward signal deceptive and/or sparse?

    - Multiplayer

        - Distribution of tasks/knowledge across agents

            - Individual agents (or agent groups) have incomplete access to the requirements (objective functions) of the other individuals/groups

                - [[task/Delta Design Game]] is #example-of this kind of problem

        - Alignment of constraints across agents (add game theory) - diff agents may have opposing constraints/incentives (P5 [[task/Orbital Federates Design Game]] is example of this kind of problem)

    - See also [[[[QUE]] - What are some major phenomena around designers' exploration of design spaces and how might these map to characteristics of optimizers?]]

    - And [[[[QUE]] - How much variability is there in the effects of diversity of examples on creative design outputs?]]
