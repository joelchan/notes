- # Synthesis

    - [[Playground: Diverse examples]]

    - ^^**variations in scaffolded interactions with examples**^^, first need to flesh out [[[[THE]] - interaction-oriented theory of creative inspiration from examples]]

    - variations in Designer attributes

        - **Propensity/capacity to explore:** [[[[CLM]] - people with lower propensity or capacity to explore benefit *less* from diverse information during ideation]]

            - Something in here about local vs. global focus

            - Some [evidence for this]([[SupportedBy]]):

                - [[[[EVD]] - Only small business owners with high divergent thinking ability generated more ideas with diverse (vs. constrained) stimuli - [[@gielnikCreativityOpportunityIdentification2011]]]]

                - [[[[EVD]] - Only small business owners with high divergent thinking ability generated more original ideas with diverse (vs. constrained) stimuli - [[@gielnikCreativityOpportunityIdentification2011]]]]

            - Possible [counter-evidence]([[Opposed By]]):

                - [[[[EVD]] - case-based reasoning system loaded with diverse cases increased overall novelty of ad campaign ideas, but only for people with lower creative ability - [[@althuizenSupportingCreativeProblem2014]]]]

                    - note: here the comparison is to nothing, not low diversity

        - **Cross-comparison:** [[[[CL]] - people with less ability to cross-compare across multiple stimuli benefit less from diverse information during ideation]]

            - Something in here about recommendations vs. maps

            - Some indirect [evidence for this]([[SupportedBy]]) from studies of parallel prototyping

                - [[[[EVD]] - Designers who prototyped designs in parallel generated more diverse designs compared to designers who prototyped serially - [[@dowParallelPrototypingLeads2010]]]]

                - [[[[EVD]] - Final advertisements from designers who prototyped designs in parallel performed better on advertising analytics compared to ads from designers who prototype designs serially - [[@dowParallelPrototypingLeads2010]]]]

    - General effects of diversity

        - "far" > "close" conceptual combinations wrt novelty (and sometimes creativity) (lots of this from the psych lit)

            - [[[[EVD]] - Design students generated more creative web service ideas when combining interdomain web service examples, compared to intradomain examples - [[@zengFosteringCreativityProduct2011]]]]

        - if low diversity --> more within category [[[[EVD]] - groups generated more ideas within categories when individuals were given high-related (vs. low-related) categories - [[@baruahCategoryAssignmentRelatedness2011]]]]

        - if high diversity --> more across categories [[[[EVD]] - groups given low-related categories of solutions ended up exploring more categories in their solutions compared to high-related category groups - [[@baruahCategoryAssignmentRelatedness2011]]]]

    - Problem space characteristics

        - ‚ÄúShape‚Äù of the design space

            - Convexity (smooth/continuous ‚Üí rugged)

            - Continuous vs. discrete

        - Legibility

            - ‚ÄúTreeness‚Äù/procedureness (can you evaluate the ‚Äúdesign‚Äù at any point in time?) -

                - Heterogeneity of a design "move"

                    - cf. [[@helmsCompoundAnalogicalDesign2008]] [[@sosaAccretionTheoryIdeation2019]]

                - [[task/Truss Design]] is an #example-of a design problem that violates this assumption

            - Is your reward signal deceptive and/or sparse?

    - Multiplayer

        - Distribution of tasks/knowledge across agents

            - Individual agents (or agent groups) have incomplete access to the requirements (objective functions) of the other individuals/groups

                - [[task/Delta Design Game]] is #example-of this kind of problem

        - Alignment of constraints across agents (add game theory) - diff agents may have opposing constraints/incentives (P5 [[task/Orbital Federates Design Game]] is example of this kind of problem)

    - See also [[[[QUE]] - What are some major phenomena around designers' exploration of design spaces and how might these map to characteristics of optimizers?]]

    - And [[[[QUE]] - How much variability is there in the effects of diversity of examples on creative design outputs?]]

- [[@eckertAdaptationSourcesInspiration2003]] for [[[[QUE]] - Under what conditions do diverse initial examples lead to better final design solutions?]] | designers used a range of strategies for working with sources of inspiration, ranging from simpler, more source-driven strategies like direct source adaptation, to more complex and reflective strategies like source analysis and schema-driven source selection; professionals were more likely to use the more complex strategies

    - this is not directly related to question of diversity (this wasn't varied), though it is on the diverse end of the spectrum, since the sources of inspiration were from a different, though closely related, domain (rugs) compared to the target task (knitwear)

    - the main relevance for our question is what the designers actually did with the examples: of particular interest is the comparison between the professional and student designers, with an implication that the professionals' strategies are ones we want to support

    - i'm mostly struck by how diverse the strategies were!

    - there was also maybe some [co-evolution]([[[[CLM]] - Design proceeds by co-evolution of problem and solution space]]) going on, but this time driven by source to problem?

    - there were differentiations between more complex, goal-directed strategies, which led to more radical and indirect transformations of the source, and simpler and more direct strategies that led to more straightforward, closer transformations of the source

    - professionals used the complex ones moreso than the students

        - this reminds me very much of [[@ballSpontaneousAnalogisingEngineering2004]]'s findings about "schema-driven" vs. "case-driven" analogizing

    - the more complex strategies also remind me of the [[üß± conceptual combination]] stuff with far vs. near pairs leading to more advanced things like emergent features

    - there is a core question here for us: how much do we think we can nudge people towards particular strategies without outright telling them, via interface differences? probably the effect is quite small, relative to an expert-novice difference. but i doubt it is zero. i am wondering about an analogy to the [[Preparation for Future Learning]] stuff, where something like an opportunity learn (here, maybe opportunity compare, or see in context) is the difference between being able to successfully transfer learning (here, maybe model and benefit from diversity)

    - quick methods notes

        - task and procedures: design menswear t-sleeve sweater with turtlenecks, with a rug/tapestry as a source of inspiration, while being videotaped and [thinking aloud]([[m/Think-aloud protocols]]) in the lab, for about 30 mins

- Thinking through person-level variations in diversity effects for [[[[QUE]] - Under what conditions do diverse initial examples lead to better final design solutions?]]

    - We want to know the conditions under which diversity might have larger or smaller effects. Roughly speaking, we'd like to abstract away "problem characteristics", and assume for a moment that this isn't a barrier.

    - Again remember: we care about diversity of **initial examples**, not diversity of search, although the latter might be influenced by the former.

    - this result seems to imply the opposite of Mark's [intuition for optimizers](so [[Mark Fuge]]'s intuition is that on the global/exploration end, diversity of initial samples should have limited marginal gain over existing propensity to explore): **[[[[CLM]] - people with lower propensity or capacity to explore benefit *less* from diverse information during ideation]]!**

        - it's like a gradient descent algorithm that basically ignores its initialization and jumps right back into local search.

        - is there potential theory behind this?

            - I'm also thinking along similar lines of the claim from [[Thomas Kuhn]] that [people within a paradigm are less open to novelty]([[Thomas Kuhn]] has the idea of a paradigm and "normal science". But according to Crotty's reading of Kuhn in Ch. 2, the presence of a paradigm is actually associated with *lower* tolerance for novelty!). Here, the mechanism feels more __affective__ in nature, like [[motivated reasoning]] or [[confirmation bias]]

            - i'm thinking of the general mechanism of [[[[THE]] - Opportunistic Assimilation Theory]] from [[[[CLM]] - Inspiration favors the prepared mind]], but it's not quite the same. a key difference is that in the classic OA case, the preparation comes from failure, from the [[Zeigarnik effect]], basically. The mechanism feels __cognitive__ in nature.

        - this could have significant implications for creativity support if it's true! it could be that we need to design much more carefully for what comes __before__ inspirational stimuli, to prime the pump, otherwise we get null effects.

    - how to follow up on this idea? #[[‚û∞ breadcrumbs]]

    - main result of interest is an interesting interaction between prior divergent thinking ability and the effects of diverse vs. constraining stimuli for a business ideation task, in terms of both quantity and originality of ideas
[[November 11th, 2021]]

    - From [diss](from my [diss](http://joelchan.me/assets/pdf/dissertation.pdf) (sadly, I didn't take detailed notes in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/0B1J84EpLdwM4TldPYzBxdndLVlk/edit?resourcekey=0-T0DGXjeOISNq_Wd3H9KAeQ#gid=491418002) the same way i did for distance):) (can expand from there too) #[[‚û∞ breadcrumbs]]

        - This is such an interesting result that connects directly to what we're wondering about.

        - But it's just one result

        - And I have a nagging feeling in my head about the *THEORY*. or lack thereof.

        - I don't think there's existing robust theory on this. At least I can't think of any off the top of my head!

        - A theory of how to maximize the benefits of diverse stimuli.

        - Maybe a bunch of hypotheses?

        - But not a really well-thought out theory.

        - So I guess we need to make our own!

        - Here's a terrible start:

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FUC0FY6HHTr.png?alt=media&token=c448f886-95a2-4b6c-b11a-c541d2756ed1)

                - Basically I think the intuition here is that the green dashed lines are sort of like "enablers"/affordances (but could also be individual differences). In a sense, the [gielnik result]([[[[EVD]] - Only small business owners with high divergent thinking ability generated more ideas with diverse (vs. constrained) stimuli - [[@gielnikCreativityOpportunityIdentification2011]]]]) is a bit on the sense of propensity/ability to explore/exploit. we can sort of artifically cap this with working memory, time constraints, etc. Which would knock out the pathway of exploration... sort of. In the sense that maybe you see the diverse stuff, and you just ignore it. So you don't get the benefit of extra draws from the design space.

    - # Background notes

        - Generally interested in model of relationship between "creativity" and new business ventures (this is why it's cited). But it does include a manipulation of diversity of stimuli (ideas given as inspiration).

    - Submotivation: what is our evidence that there is variability to explain?
[[December 8th, 2021]]

- Thinking back to [[[[QUE]] - Under what conditions do diverse initial examples lead to better final design solutions?]], specifically re: [presentation paradigms and interaction design effects]([[[[EXP]] - [[D/Solution-Diversity]] - exploring presentation interaction effects on mechanism of inspiration from diverse examples]])

    - My gut says at this point most of the backing for our hypotheses is going to be theoretical, rather than straight empirical, because it hasn't really been thoroughly explored yet: this is a new foray! But makes sense from theory.

    - We know from the old lit on conceptual combination that combinations are taking place, so obviously showing multiple at the same time is a good thing; though our current experiment can't really test this because it's not really about this sort of thing

    - So The modeling piece then is the main thing we're looking at..

        - Emerging argument

            - Diverse examples can provide more information for modeling purposes

                - This is straight logic for now, I think? And that's ok.

            - People do modeling (from examples)

    - I'm feeling that we don't have all the pieces for this though. So let's explore and forage.

        - Expertise lit: reflection and action, modeling --> problem formulation, so examples --> problem (re)formulation

        - How people work with examples

            - Provisionally, we can learn from practice, where people like to display all their examples at once, and often put them on some kind of structure

            - [[C. Eckert]]'s stuff, focusing on the idea of grokking the cultural and technical context from sources of inspiration

            - [[@herringGettingInspiredUnderstanding2009]] and related work based on interviews

            - [[Andruid Kerne]]'s stuff with [[IdeaMache]]: curating and working with "found objects": [[@kerneStrategiesFreeFormWeb2017]] talks a bit about the strategy of shifting perspective, but this is more about the interaction (putting stuff together, going up and down)

            - anything from [[Elena Glassman]]? she has done some stuff on visualizing programming solution examples, but that's for instruction

            - [[@xuIdeateRelateExamplesGallery2021]] compares a list to a viz (with context information), but it's mostly about conceptual distance, not diversity

            - definitely from [[@leeDesigningInteractiveExample2010]] - explores the use of multiple examples in a design

                - and more of [[Ranjitha Kumar]]'s stuff

    - A thought to come back to: here, diversity almost might be secondary: we lean on this as an intuitive way to think about when examples might be useful and when they might not be useful, as an instance of a situation where we can test our theory about interaction design features that moderate the effects of examples on design work
[[September 29th, 2021]]

- Foraging for papers for [[[[QUE]] - Under what conditions do diverse initial examples lead to better final design solutions?]]

    - To recontextualize from [last time](Thinking through person-level variations in diversity effects for [[[[QUE]] - Under what conditions do diverse initial examples lead to better final design solutions?]])

        - The deeper thing we want to understand is the "non-problem" conditions that might influence whether/how diversity matters

        - Roughly speaking we can think of:

            - "Interface" level things

                - Sequential vs. parallel

                    - This makes me think of [[@dowParallelPrototypingLeads2010]]

                        - There, the parallel mechanism is more about enabling less attachment to particular parts of the solution space

                    - Related to:

                        - Implicitly building model of space; idea of "[[gestalt]]", greater than sum of parts

                            - How might this work to enhance or limit the effects of diverse initial examples?

                                - if presentation of examples is in list, hard to see overall space, and hard to then have "global" view -->

                                    - less jumps in the initial space

                                        - lower p(switch) when current patch is exhausted (more fixation)

                                            - this seems similar to what is found in [[@dowParallelPrototypingLeads2010]].

                                                - let's read that paper again, and draw out possible breadcrumbs

                                        - more sequential/local exploration

                                    - less unusual combinations (again, local variations)

        - At the end of the day, I think what is most interesting and impactful is sketching out a model of the **mechanisms** by which diverse initial examples can enable better design exploration

    - the key idea here seems to be that of [[emergent properties]], which are properties that are characteristic of a combination, but not of its constituent parts - an example is the property of being a "personal electronic entry" (for a homepage), which isn't true of either homes or pages, separately.

        - this seems closely related to the idea of [[synthesis]], to be honest, regarding the idea of a [novel conceptual whole](#Claim There are two core concepts for synthesis: 1) creating a new whole from parts, and 2) displaying at least some level of __conceptual__ innovation (higher = clearer case of synthesis)) from [[@strikeTypesSynthesisTheir1983]]

                        - Abstract

                            - Engineering idea generation plays a vital role in the development of novel products. Prior studies have shown that designers fixate to the features of example solutions and replicate these features in their ideas. This is a major hindrance in idea generation as it restricts the solution space where designers search for their ideas. This study hypothesizes that though expert designers fixate to example features, they still can outperform novices in terms of quantity of ideas as they have a larger set of knowledge acquired through their experience. To investigate this, the experimental by Linsey et al. is replicated for novice designers. Novices generate ideas for a design problem in three groups: one group working with a fixating example, a second group working with the same example along with alternate representations for the design problem and a control group only presented with the problem and no additional materials. The obtained results support the hypothesis. Both novice and expert designers are fixated to the example features, but the expert designers generated more nonredundant ideas. The alternate representations of the design problem help experts in mitigating their fixation, whereas in novices, these have no effect.

                        - Abstract

                            - Design-by-Analogy (DbA) is recognized for its potential for fostering innovation. Previous work provides insights into how analogies assist in solving problems in engineering design and architecture. However, services currently add more than 65% of global economic value. Designers now face design problems not only in physical systems but transactional as well. This study expands our understanding of design practitioners' cognitive processes by exploring the development of innovative solutions for transactional problems using a DbA approach, via a semantic-word-based ideation method, on a relatively large expert sample size (n=73) of transactional domain experts. The study shows correlations for semantic solution transfer, quantity of ideation, fixation, novelty and quality when developing solutions for transactional problems by means of DbA methods.

- discussing the paper for  [[[[EXP]] - [[D/Solution-Diversity]] Bayesian Optimizer on Wildcat Wells function with low vs. high diverse examples]]. finally a convergent answer to [[[[QUE]] - Under what conditions do diverse initial examples lead to better final design solutions?]]!

    - the results

        - result 1: [[[[RES]] - No consistent effect of low vs. high diverse examples for Bayesian Optimization performance, as measured by optimality gap, over systematically varied smoothness and ruggedness amplitude settings for Wildcat Wells functions - [[[[EXP]] - [[D/Solution-Diversity]] Bayesian Optimizer on Wildcat Wells function with low vs. high diverse examples]]]]

        - result 2: [[[[RES]] - Bayesian Optimizer optimized closer to the optimal kernel lengthscale for a Wildcat Wells function when initialized with low vs. high diversity examples - [[[[EXP]] - [[D/Solution-Diversity]] Bayesian Optimizer on Wildcat Wells function with low vs. high diverse examples]]]]

        - result 3: [[[[RES]] - When a Bayesian Optimizer is initialized to optimal lengthscale hyperparameter, highly diverse examples consistently improves performance on a Wildcat Wells function relative to non-diverse examples.

    - next steps

        - overall, modulo some improvements, we're ready to write this up and send it off to JMD! next step is for [[Eesh Kamrah]] to integrate the improvements and discussion from today into the [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project/62974e70afa1dd80010a098f), and then [[Joel Chan]] and [[Mark Fuge]] and [[Jason Ding]] will do full pass over the manuscript before we send off to internal readers ([[Fatemeh Ghoreishi]], maybe [[Matt Erhart]] too?)

        - improvements

            - we want to improve the plots for result 2: [[[[RES]] - Bayesian Optimizer optimized closer to the optimal kernel lengthscale for a Wildcat Wells function when initialized with low vs. high diversity examples - [[[[EXP]] - [[D/Solution-Diversity]] Bayesian Optimizer on Wildcat Wells function with low vs. high diverse examples]]]]

                - move the params we don't care about to supplemental

                - simplify to just a 4 x 4 for lengthscale, and grids for the rest in supplemental (just the boxplots)

            - we want to double-check the percent improvements numbers for result 3: [[[[RES]] - When a Bayesian Optimizer is initialized to optimal lengthscale hyperparameter, highly diverse examples consistently improves performance on a Wildcat Wells function relative to non-diverse examples. This effect is consistent across variations of the function wrt smoothness and ruggedness amplitude - [[[[EXP]] - [[D/Solution-Diversity]] Bayesian Optimizer on Wildcat Wells function with low vs. high diverse examples]]]]

            - we're happy with result 1: [[[[RES]] - No consistent effect of low vs. high diverse examples for Bayesian Optimization performance, as measured by optimality gap, over systematically varied smoothness and ruggedness amplitude settings for Wildcat Wells functions - [[[[EXP]] - [[D/Solution-Diversity]] Bayesian Optimizer on Wildcat Wells function with low vs. high diverse examples]]]]
