- so maybe for [[[[QUE]] - How can we measure everyday progress in open-ended creative work?]], some initial thoughts

    - achievement-oriented goals --> milestones

        - could be milestones in typical life of projects

            - thinking of the [[study design design process]] from [[@koStudyDesignDesign2019]]

                - pay particular attention to the "what you make" - these are "product oriented"

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2Fyw_p1ySZIB.png?alt=media&token=c2808a7a-9849-4066-8656-6fe8460ad8ac)

        - could also be question/uncertainty-oriented, similar to [[@ahrensHowTakeSmart2017]], or how [[Andy Matuschak]] thinks about his writing inbox, or similar to the idea of [[riskiest risks]] - "now my most urgent and impactful question is..."

    - action-goals (put in the time)

        - directed at one or more riskiest risks

- [This tweet](https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1321927908621918208) by [[Andy Matuschak]] is eye-catching, making some connections to what we've been thinking about with [[[[QUE]] - How can we measure everyday progress in open-ended creative work?]], and my general philosophy of mentoring: is apparent sociopathy and workaholism *necessary* for eminent, creative contributions? Or does it even make it statistically more likely to happen? I think of this as the "Steve Jobs asshole hypothesis"

    - I feel compelled to respond, at least to myself and for my students, and I'm reminded of what seems to be the major takeaway from [[@csikszentmihalyiCreativityFlowPsychology1997]]'s extraordinary study of eminent creators: a disproving of the Steve Jobs hypothesis. Maybe.

[[September 19th, 2020]]

- Re-read [[@koStudyDesignDesign2019]] for [[[[QUE]] - How can we measure everyday progress in open-ended creative work?]], and I have some thoughts:

    - The penultimate output reminds me of what [[Steven P. Dow]] called a "study protocol" artifact, which he made me do, and he learned it from [[Scott R. Klemmer]]

        - The advice in there is also very similar to what many people do: write the intro and methods section before you run your study! Then you won't have to confabulate and fumble around when you circle back to write your methods, and be totally lost at how to write your intro.

        - The written argument motivating the question is also similar to the [[Heilmeier Catechism]] output.

            - In particular, the structure of the written argument artifact has that nice AND BUT THEREFORE structure to it

        - The written argument is also decomposed into a series of claims and questions, which is a nice fit for the process I'm developing to structure the early nebulous stage, and also make sure that any work done here can be reused in later projects and by others!

            - Can probably do this in Obsidian I think.

            - Also might be able to jerry rig in a Google Doc + citations version that links to subheadings in a giant notes doc

            - But probably can get a lot of value by just a basic outline with citations (and trust that the notes are there for reuse; big ask!)

    - My mods:

        - {{table}}

            - 1: Explore your question space

                - Collect stuff!

                    - Annotated bib + research question + "map" (to situate)
Key claims and questions

                        - None

            - 3: Iterate on your question

                - Get feedback on your argument! Both yourself and (100% others). This is a good point to give a talk.

                    - N revised versions of your written argument
Feedback traces and reflections on revised versions

                        - if one or more key characteristics (interestingness, soundness, importance, novelty) unsatisfactory, either iterate, pivot, or abandon (if taking too long).

            - 2: Formulate your question

                - Read and write! Observe! Bring your question to colleagues and chat about it.

                    - First draft of written argument motivation the question

                        - If you can't come up with any question *you* feel is likely to be interesting/sound/important/novel

            - 4: Design your method

                - Write and plan!

                    - First draft of methods and limitations (in discussion) section of paper

                        - None

            - 5: Iterate on your method

                - Get feedback via pilot testing, discussion, etc.

                    - Pilot data, IRB, N revised versions of methods section, feedback traces and reflections on methods and limitations drafts

                        - if one or more key characteristics (feasibility, validity, ethics) unsatisfactory, either iterate, pivot, or abandon

            - 6: Execute study

                - Run the study!

                    - Data!

                        - ideally none

            - 7: Reflect on results

                - Analyze and write up results, iterate on intro

                    - Full manuscript draft

                        - decide whether we want to submit this. if results amount to a contribution, proceed; else, go back to previous steps depending on what might be the problem

            - 8: Get feedback on manuscript

                - Get feedback!

                    - Feedback traces and reflections on draft

                        - Ideally none: we only do this if we agree the paper makes a contribution (which, if we did the previous steps right, it should! Good studies should be informative no matter what the answer)

            - 9: Polish and submit your manuscript!

                - Write!

                    - Manuscript submission

                        - None

            - Phase

                - Actions

                    - Artifacts

                        - Pivot / escape hatch

    - I'm also not super clear on [the diagram](![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2Fyw_p1ySZIB.png?alt=media&token=c2808a7a-9849-4066-8656-6fe8460ad8ac)), particularly the higher level stage names (situate, evaluate, formulate, articulate) - easier to think about some key gates in terms of artifacts.

        - A word about Pivot / escape hatch

            - Don't worry if you abandon! If you did the previous steps right, you'll be able to benefit from all that work at some point for sure, unless you 100% abandon your research area entirely!
