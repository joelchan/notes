- #[[Question]] for [[D/Computational Analogy]]

    - Tags: #analogy #[[scholarly workflows]]

    - Description

        - We can reframe this question to ask, how do scholars and scientists "import" ideas overall, especially across disciplinary boundaries?

            - [[@palmerWorkBoundariesScience2001]] provides a useful framework for understanding the process of "import" of information for interdisciplinary scholarship.

            - Note that this study was done in the past, pre [[sys/Semantic Scholar]] and the like: I want to know what the state of play actually is today.

                - {{[[TODO]]}} Need to do a lit search (document with Knovigator) + network search (via COnnectedPapers and similar) + who would know the answer to this?

        - It can be useful to reframe these practices in stages of access, filtering/evaluating, and using imported information, each with their own set of unique and recurring challenges

            1. **access**

                1. actually just knowing / realizing / noticing that something might be worth looking into

                1. failure mode: the "missing literature" problem

                1. people can help: talk to them about your problem, and they will say "oh have you looked at..."

                    1. Tom Tate (a complex systems chemist) described the "oh have you looked at..." phenomenon: often they will spend a lot of time looking for relevant articles, without success, and then have someone walk into their office and recommend exactly the article they needed to see [[@palmerWorkBoundariesScience2001]]

                    1. ^^somehow this can be much more efficient than trying to search on your own. why is that? what is going on here? do we even have a good picture of what's going on here? the query reformulation, and so on?^^

                        1. best i can think of is our [[analogy workshop with Bex's lab in 2017]]

            1. **filtering/evaluating**

                1. figuring out which things are worth deeper processing

                1. honing / refining the search

                1. failure mode: the TMI or [[information overload]] problem

                    1. this probably also contributes to the access problem: you sort of feel "full" and stop looking because you have too many things to process!

                1. people acting as powerful personalized filters, not just portals to different worlds, was a strong theme in [[@palmerWorkBoundariesScience2001]]

                    1. Neil Nash (a Bioenergetics specialist, one of the generalists) [talked about](((HqjxT28Ew))) how informal communication was especially helpful because their sources knew them and they had developed a relationship of trust with them, so they could help narrow and filter and interpret much more quickly

                    1. A Vision Specialist interviewed by Palmer also reported that recommendations from informal contacts [tended to have](part of the value also of talking with someone was knowing what to look for when consulting a new reference (in a sentence, what is there)) [high signal to noise ratios](((xT1gpt5me)))

                1. what does this look like?

                    1. situated, cf. the intermediaries

            1. **using??**

                1. seems embedded with **filtering/evaluating** - part of filtering/evaluating is figuring out if it sparks anything useful

                1. the "intermediary" translator role of graduate students seems to be more of this sort - how to actually apply to the problem and translate from somewhere else

                    1. scientists at the interdisciplinary research center sometimes imported information across disciplinary boundaries via **intermediaries** (often graduate students playing this role) (pp. 47-50) [[@palmerWorkBoundariesScience2001]]

        - these stages can be mapped to the stages of retrieval, mapping, and transfer in analogical problem solving

        - [[[[QUE]] - What are the most efficient routes to useful cross-boundary knowledge?]]

            - "people" seem to help with each of these, but in different ways

[[Notes from Joel's PhD about analogy]]

- What do we currently know about what is happening cognitively when a designer is inspired by an analogy (or set of analogies) and produces an innovative design? --> [[[[QUE]] - How does analogy actually happen in the process of scholarly/scientific innovation?]] [[[[QUE]] - What are the mechanisms by which analogies help drive creative breakthroughs?]]

    - The designer has accessed or retrieved some cue from either the environment or memory, and some kind of analogy process is happening

        - Could have a direct benefit – e.g., some relation or solution element in the source analog solves the currently open problem in an innovative way

            - The designer has mapped relations between the source and target analogs

                - Described as structural alignment by Gentner’s structure mapping engine ([SME]([[tmodel/SME]]))

                - [MAC/FAC]([[tmodel/MAC-FAC]]), [LISA]([[tmodel/LISA]]), and other models

            - Some mapped relation solves a currently open problem

        - Could be an indirect benefit

            - The deep structure route. The analog acts as a memory cue, such as we might observe an expert designer “jumping” from one analog straight to another far-field analog via some “deep structure” connection (Blanchette & Dunbar, 2000). I need to read up more on this to kee

            - The “insight” route. The analog is so far-field that thinking about it [restructures]([[problem (re)formulation]]) the problem representation in such a way that access to a relevant analog or creative idea becomes now “open”, e.g., through relaxing of constraints or [chunk decompositions]([[chunk decomposition]]) ([Knoblich et al, 1999]([[@knoblichConstraintRelaxationChunk1999]]))  Broad question: is this restructuring random or is it systematic in some describable way? Any more specific questions at this point? We are still processing this idea.

            - The perceptual cue route?? Just throwing this out there – maybe a special feature of design or visually intensive creative domains? This goes back to Kate’s question of whether geometry can imply functionality. Some clues along this path can be found in some work by Nerssessian and other work in perceptual simulation (see, e.g., Catrambone, Craig, & Nersessian, 2006; Craig, Nersessian, & Catrambone, 2002), which suggests that there are ways that you can represent information, even with lots of superficial detail, that confer advantages in terms of facilitating activation of a relevant image schema (Mandler, 1992), which can bring up relevant knowledge of functional principles that can help solve the problem

    - Palmer identified 6 broad categories of practices that enable scientists to "import" information across disciplinary boundaries

        1. scientists import information across disciplinary boundaries via engagment with **conferences**

        1. scientists import information across disciplinary boundaries from the published and unpublished **literature**

        1. scientists import information across disciplinary boundaries via participating in more or less formal **learning activities/experiences**

            1. journal clubs

            1. workshops

            1. seminars

            1. lectures

        1. scientists import information across disciplinary boundaries via engaging in learning activities/experiences in the role of a **teacher**

            - formal

            - informal / one-time
[[November 24th, 2020]]

- Writing session  / double up as an #example-of [[Z: Paths and workflows towards synthesis]], but focused on [[[[QUE]] - How does analogy actually happen in the process of scholarly/scientific innovation?]] for [[idea: sociotechnical analogical connector]]

    - Pulling on this thread a bit more: thread on people > ideas for [[D/Computational Analogy]] - VERY IMPORTANT (archived on [[December 20th, 2020]], since [[Xin Qian]] and I are actively mining this thread rn)

    - Want to focus more on the [role of people in mediating access to out of domain knowledge]([[[[QUE]] - What are the most efficient routes to useful cross-boundary knowledge?]])

        - So this should involve the stuff on:

            - [[outsider innovation]]

                - [[@hargadonTechnologyBrokeringInnovation1997]]

                - [[@burtStructuralHolesGood2004]]

                - [[Steven L. Johnson]] is also a good source of this

                - as is [[Haiyi Zhu]]

            - [[[[CLM]] - In interdisciplinary domains, network-based foraging is more powerful than search-based foraging]], but focused on people

                - get the thread going from [[@palmerWorkBoundariesScience2001]]

            - [[[[CLM]] - Substantial portions of knowledge that is critical for innovation are not written down]]

                - this gets at the point that literature on its own would be far from sufficient, perhaps especially in the case of [[interdisciplinarity]], because people writing for a disciplinary audience will probably assume their audience knows things you don't, and consequently leave them out from what is actually written down

    - There is a stub claim / inkling here that accessing, interacting with, and successfully making use of (whether transferring, adapting, or inspiring) analogical inspirations can be a long and complex process

        - the [attribute problem]([[[[CLM]] - Core attribute (mis)matches mediate the benefits of analogies in real-world, complex problem solving]]) still seems important, but i don't quite feel like we have an angle of attack, at least on the access side

            - but i suspect that, again going back to [[analogy workshop with Bex's lab in 2017]] as an example of this, "processing analogies with people"

        - to spec out an idea that came out in discussion with [[Xin Qian]] yesterday:

            - what if we had analogical journal clubs, where:

                - we specify a problem

                - include a paper from the same domain

                - and an analogical paper or two (retrieved from our system)

                - AND someone from the domain of the paper (need to figure out how to identify them)

                    - could be author of the paper

                    - someone who's read it and knows of it

                    - someone who's "near" to the paper in bibliometric space

                - and then generate some discussion prompts to promote [[generative misalignment]]

            - generalizing this to [[org/ConservationX]], it could be regular brainstorms

                - but I'm not sure that papers would be a sensible unit of analysis

        - There seem to be three big buckets, each with their own set of unique and recurring challenges ([moved to zettel](It can be useful to reframe these practices in stages of access, filtering/evaluating, and using imported information, each with their own set of unique and recurring challenges))

        - Where might analogy fit into these processes and workflows of import?

            - i think my hunch is that [[analogical search]] can help with **access**

                - but if it is disconnected from "people" (or mechanisms) to help with **filtering/evaluating**, at least in eval, we just won't see any impact

                - it's important to take a closer look at what it is that people are doing, to the query, the information, etc. to really understand what effective access to analogical sources looks like, and where the inefficiencies are

                    - one idea is that [[[[QUE]] - What are the most efficient routes to useful cross-boundary knowledge?]] (really should make this a zettel and spec it out - how much do we believe this?), so once you get in touch with them, it's not clear what marginal value is added from [[analogical search]], beyond maybe speeding up the honing process (but it's probably already pretty efficient).

                        - one of the important points here, though, might be the likelihood of finding the "right person" to talk to.

                            - it goes beyond them having the right knowledge

                            - they also need to know something about you

                            - or at least enough to do this honing interactive thing?

                        - strong claim from [[@palmerWorkBoundariesScience2001]] here:

                            - "no other type of information interaction is likely to be [as] efficient and profitable [as interactive discussions with colleagues]" (p. 33-34)

                                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FDOXx8JCt2e.png?alt=media&token=2e187808-d9f8-495c-9bf6-7c194c904a18)

                - in these ways

                    - help connect with people who would fill your gaps or expand your horizons usefully

                    - directly point you towards things that fill your gaps or expand your horizons usefully

            - another question is what work [[analogy]] might be doing in the **using??** stage: again, beyond helping with access, analogical processes can help modify the problem space, through highlighting [[Z: Alignable differences]]

        - [[@fosterNonlinearModelInformationseeking2004]]

            - [[sys/scite.ai]] reports that [[@pontisUnderstandingInfluenceExploratory2015]] [reports](https://scite.ai/reports/a-nonlinear-model-of-information-seeking-GA3xkb?contradicting=false&mentioning=false&page=1&utm_campaign=badge_generic&utm_medium=plugin&utm_source=generic) confirming/supporting the overall shape of the nonlinear model of information seeking

            - intro has many papers that are worth referencing for us, talking about how models of [[information behavior]] do a good job of modeling *disciplinary* information seeking, but are far from sufficient for describing interdisciplinary information-seeking, leaving core questions posed by [[@bates1996learning]] basically unanswered

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FdRvvJC1etj.png?alt=media&token=8d492755-48c5-491b-b6d6-7ff36e312e96) (p. 229)

    - Time to wrap up this thread

        - Emerging claims

            - [[Z: Interdisciplinary information seeking is qualitatively different from disciplinary information seeking]]

                - [Informal sources play a very large (maybe primary?) role in access/filtering of information across interdisciplinary boundaries]([[[[QUE]] - What are the most efficient routes to useful cross-boundary knowledge?]]) (perhaps more so than disciplinary information seeking, which is well-served by IR infrastructure)

                    - There's some magic in the access stage (probably driven by query (re)formulation)

                    - And also some magic in the filtering stage

                    - Subpoint here that we need to break out hte information seeking process into distinct subprocesses, with distinct challenges and solutions from informal sources

            - All the stuff about [[structural holes]] and [[outsider innovation]] may not connect directly with scientific work (different worlds), but they can inform!

                - They do connect to [[@palmerWorkBoundariesScience2001]]'s ideas about the [intermediaries](scientists at the interdisciplinary research center sometimes imported information across disciplinary boundaries via **intermediaries** (often graduate students playing this role) (pp. 47-50))

                - And also play a nice contrast to conflicting findings about [[[[QUE]] - How might domain distance modulate the effects of analogies on creative output?]]

        - So where do we go next?

            - But I also want to have a much better model of what magic is actually happening in these conversations, from a "search" standpoint, so we can bottle it

                - I haven't yet seen a satisfactory model of this - ideally mapped to an abstracted description of patterns / moves, but also motifs over time (not just "yes, they iterate"; how much?? what does it look like? what's actually happening to the query?)

            - For our [[analogical search]] stuff to work well, we'd want to:

                - plug into this magic (make sure our results can result in a ^^**smooth handoff to the right person**^^(s)), and/or

                - recreate some of the magic that is happening

                - help make this magic happen more often / better

                - in other words, [[idea: sociotechnical analogical connector]]

            - At minimum, I want to know what the size of this effect is, if any: how much more effective is person-driven search than even a "state of the art" search engine?

                - it seems like a truism that people would benefit more from analogy if they discuss it with people, but... i don't know if that's been shown? and really analyzed in detail just how differently things play out and in what specific ways?

                - Maybe conditions:

                    - Vanilla keyword-search

                    - Vanilla keyword-search + analogical search

                    - Interdisciplinary person

                    - Vanilla keyword-search + analogical search + interdisciplinary person

            - #[[➰ breadcrumbs]] we definitely need to keep in parallel:

                - {{[[DONE]]}} Pulling on the lit review thread --> {{[[TODO]]}} [[Xin Qian]] Get going on some foraging tasks. Given lists of refs from seeds, draft quick answer + supporting screenshot(s) for the questions they're mapped to, attached to pageref to citekey (~5-10 hrs/wk)

                    - {{[[DONE]]}} ➰ breadcrumbs for [[November 25th, 2020]]: collect some papers we want to zettel, starting with the old classics in infosci

                        - we don't want to just restrict to science, since i think some of our work should go back to the engineering design stuff (as low-hanging fruit)

                - {{[[TODO]]}} Quick and dirty prototyping to make some of our ideas visible (around [[idea: sociotechnical analogical connector]])

                - {{[[TODO]]}} Maybe a formative study of some kind

                    - maybe run an additional version of the [[analogy workshop with Bex's lab in 2017]]

                    - what could we prototype quickly within the iSchool?

                    - a riff on [[Brain dump from [[Wayne Lutters]] about [[D/Synthesis Infrastructure]] on [[February 18th, 2020]]]]?

                - {{[[TODO]]}} Start re-exploring CXL and other possible test beds

                    - e.g., it occurs to me that [[Biologically Inspired Design]] or [[biomimicry]] should be in this vein as well - rather than give you ideas to inspire you, connect you to someone to brainstorm with

            - last thought before i close for today:

                - another wrinkle to add is the familiarity of the analogical source to the user

                    - if somewhat familiar (have read a few papers, maybe even cited some), then showing abstracts might be ok

                    - but if completely new, or close to new, then should be exposed to them via an intermediary

                        - it occurs to me that [[Biologically Inspired Design]] or [[biomimicry]] should be in this vein as well - rather than give you ideas to inspire you, connect you to someone to brainstorm with

                            - could run some experiments with [[BIOCENE]]??
