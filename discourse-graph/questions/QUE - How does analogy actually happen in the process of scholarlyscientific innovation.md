- #[[Question]] for [[D/Computational Analogy]]

    - Tags: #analogy #[[scholarly workflows]]

    - Description

        - We can reframe this question to ask, how do scholars and scientists "import" ideas overall, especially across disciplinary boundaries?

            - [[@palmerWorkBoundariesScience2001]] provides a useful framework for understanding the process of "import" of information for interdisciplinary scholarship.

            - Note that this study was done in the past, pre [[sys/Semantic Scholar]] and the like: I want to know what the state of play actually is today.

                - {{[[TODO]]}} Need to do a lit search (document with Knovigator) + network search (via COnnectedPapers and similar) + who would know the answer to this?

        - It can be useful to reframe these practices in stages of access, filtering/evaluating, and using imported information, each with their own set of unique and recurring challenges

            1. **access**

                1. actually just knowing / realizing / noticing that something might be worth looking into

                1. failure mode: the "missing literature" problem

                1. people can help: talk to them about your problem, and they will say "oh have you looked at..."

                    1. Tom Tate (a complex systems chemist) described the "oh have you looked at..." phenomenon: often they will spend a lot of time looking for relevant articles, without success, and then have someone walk into their office and recommend exactly the article they needed to see [[@palmerWorkBoundariesScience2001]]

                    1. ^^somehow this can be much more efficient than trying to search on your own. why is that? what is going on here? do we even have a good picture of what's going on here? the query reformulation, and so on?^^

                        1. best i can think of is our [[analogy workshop with Bex's lab in 2017]]

            1. **filtering/evaluating**

                1. figuring out which things are worth deeper processing

                1. honing / refining the search

                1. failure mode: the TMI or [[information overload]] problem

                    1. this probably also contributes to the access problem: you sort of feel "full" and stop looking because you have too many things to process!

                1. people acting as powerful personalized filters, not just portals to different worlds, was a strong theme in [[@palmerWorkBoundariesScience2001]]

                    1. Neil Nash (a Bioenergetics specialist, one of the generalists) [talked about](((HqjxT28Ew))) how informal communication was especially helpful because their sources knew them and they had developed a relationship of trust with them, so they could help narrow and filter and interpret much more quickly

                    1. A Vision Specialist interviewed by Palmer also reported that recommendations from informal contacts [tended to have](part of the value also of talking with someone was knowing what to look for when consulting a new reference (in a sentence, what is there)) [high signal to noise ratios](((xT1gpt5me)))

                1. what does this look like?

                    1. situated, cf. the intermediaries

            1. **using??**

                1. seems embedded with **filtering/evaluating** - part of filtering/evaluating is figuring out if it sparks anything useful

                1. the "intermediary" translator role of graduate students seems to be more of this sort - how to actually apply to the problem and translate from somewhere else

                    1. scientists at the interdisciplinary research center sometimes imported information across disciplinary boundaries via **intermediaries** (often graduate students playing this role) (pp. 47-50) [[@palmerWorkBoundariesScience2001]]

        - these stages can be mapped to the stages of retrieval, mapping, and transfer in analogical problem solving

        - [[[[QUE]] - What are the most efficient routes to useful cross-boundary knowledge?]]

            - "people" seem to help with each of these, but in different ways
