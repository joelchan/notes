- #Question

    - # Synthesis

        - Hard bc [[[[CLM]] - The notion of an 'idea' is very complicated]]

        - Though perhaps process-based measures that are theoretically grounded and measurement-level precise are viable.

[[QUE - How can we measure efficacy of creativity support systems]]

- closely depends on the answer to [[[[QUE]] - Is it possible to measure creativity in a scientifically precise way? If so, how?]]

    - If the answer is no, or not really, then we should be quite skeptical of experimental evidence. This is the basic consensus in [[@shneidermanCreativitySupportTools2006]], recommending [[Multi-dimensional InDepth Long-term Case Studies (MILC Studies)]] instead as a way to figure out if creativity support is happening.

- we need to have a giant overarching question: [[[[QUE]] - Is it possible to measure creativity in a scientifically precise way? If so, how?]]

    - This is where [[@sosaAccretionTheoryIdeation2019]]'s stuff comes in

    - And also [[[[CLM]] - Paths to creative breakthroughs are frequently oblique]], which makes it challenging to measure

    - want to decompose novelty from extent and impact from amount to types and nature of novelty and impact

        - new results/theories/methods

        - consolidating/disrupting impact

    - uses this WONDERFUL dataset: citation classic commentaries: http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics.html

- fun post and discussion about epistemelogical issues around empirical software engineering research: qualitative research >>>>> experimental lab stuff. very similar to issues we have around [[[[QUE]] - Is it possible to measure creativity in a scientifically precise way? If so, how?]]

    - Definitions, with weight/justification where possible

        - [[@csikszentmihalyiCreativityFlowPsychology1997]] [[Csikszentmihalyi's Systems Model of Creativity]]

            - > "Creativity is any act, idea, or product that changes an existing domain, or that transforms an existing domain into a new one. And the definition of a creative person is: someone whose thoughts or actions change a domain, or establish a new domain. It is important to remember, however, that a domain cannot be changed without the explicit or implicit consent of the field responsible for it. (p. 28)

            - > creativity cannot be manifested in the absence of a field that recognizes and legitimizes the novel contributions. (p. 29)

            - basically, there are three things:

        - [[@bodenCreativeMindMyths2004]]: a creative product is most creative when it *transforms* a domain. But even extensions to a domain can be considered creative (as in normal science).

        - [[@amabileSocialPsychologyCreativity1982]]'s [[Consensual Assessment Technique (CAT)]] is a commonly employed and thoughtfully justified measure of the creativity of products, and relies on not just novelty, but consensual assessment of valuable novelty by a jury of  appropriate experts (or, in [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]]'s terms, appropriately qualified representatives of a relevant field).

            - As [[@sawyerExplainingCreativityScience2012]] notes:

                - > "The CAT depends on the sociocultural criterion of appropriateness as evaluated by a community" (p. 42)
