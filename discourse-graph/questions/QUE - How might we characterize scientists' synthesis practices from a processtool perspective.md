    - Tools generally are "iTunes for papers" [[@qianITunesPapersRedefining2019a]]

        - [[@bosmanInnovationsScholarlyCommunication2016]]

            - European-leaning, but we get some confirmation/corroboration in smaller, more focused samples

                - [[@qianOpeningBlackBox2020]]

                - [[@willisDocumentsDistributedScientific2014]]

                - [[@hoangOpportunitiesComputerSupport2018]]

    - Fragmentation/variation - no single tool

        - [[@qianOpeningBlackBox2020]]

    - Tool choice constrained by "extrinsic" factors like whether it's free or not, or overlap with collaborators' practices

        - [[@qianOpeningBlackBox2020]]

        - [[@hoangOpportunitiesComputerSupport2018]]

    - "one-off", little to no reuse

        - [[@blakeCollaborativeInformationSynthesis2006a]]

    - [[active reading]]

    - if there's info on this, should be in [[scholarly workflows]]

    - [[@wareSTMReportOverview2015]]

    - Yet, there are some hints of optimal paths, that on closer analysis, seem to align with the epistemic models [[@qianOpeningBlackBox2020]]

        - [[Desire Path]]

            - What we see now is not infrastructure for synthesis. Instead, we see people either resort to all sorts of "hacks" and workarounds, or put in a substantial amount of work to "mine" publications for what they need (for an evocative example of this, see [[@knightEnslavedTrappedData2019]]

    - most academic studies aren't set up to be able to evaluate these, because we need serious usage. on the flip sides, industry folks either aren't sharing data, or aren't collecting it

    - so we lack a good understanding, beyond weak circumstantial/anecdotal evidence of the value of these design patterns
