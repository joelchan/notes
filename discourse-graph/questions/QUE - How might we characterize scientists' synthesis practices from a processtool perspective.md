    - Tools generally are "iTunes for papers" [[@qianITunesPapersRedefining2019a]] - I think this is very fair

        - [[@bosmanInnovationsScholarlyCommunication2016]] - can see by far most popular tools are "iTunes for papers": Reference management tools like [[sys/EndNote]], [[sys/Mendeley]], and [[sys/Zotero]] were the most frequently mentioned "cite" tools by [researchers](((TqJhckxKb))) worldwide responding to an online survey in [[2015]]. These top 3 tools collectively accounted for ~60% of responses.

            - European-leaning, but we get some confirmation/corroboration in smaller, more focused samples

                - [[@qianOpeningBlackBox2020]] [ecology of tools](![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FpfGp_fY99U.png?alt=media&token=db2472d9-6884-467c-8ae0-5db27fcb6643)) includes Zotero and Mendeley

                - [[@willisDocumentsDistributedScientific2014]] Sample of 12 social scientists used mix of Endnote and Mendeley for reference management

                - [[@hoangOpportunitiesComputerSupport2018]][researchers](((R4yIJzOBs))) basically never used specialized software for their [[systematic review]]s: instead, the most common tools were [[sys/Microsoft Excel]] and [[sys/EndNote]]

    - Fragmentation/variation - no single tool

        - [[@qianOpeningBlackBox2020]] Scholars varied substantially in the [[ecology of tools]] used for [[synthesis]]: no single tool was used to encompass every (sub)task, and few tools were common across all scholars.

    - Tool choice constrained by "extrinsic" factors like whether it's free or not, or overlap with collaborators' practices

        - [[@qianOpeningBlackBox2020]]

        - [[@hoangOpportunitiesComputerSupport2018]] [researchers](((R4yIJzOBs))) basically never used specialized software for their [[systematic review]]s: instead, the most common tools were [[sys/Microsoft Excel]] and [[sys/EndNote]]

    - "one-off", little to no reuse

        - [[@blakeCollaborativeInformationSynthesis2006a]] the scientists in both study groups needed to [[reuse]] articles from previous projects, but it was hard to do so ?

    - [[active reading]]?

    - if there's info on this, should be in [[scholarly workflows]] lit...

    - [[@wareSTMReportOverview2015]]

    - Yet, there are some hints of optimal paths, that on closer analysis, seem to align with the epistemic models [[@qianOpeningBlackBox2020]] [[@chanWhereRubberMeets2020]]

        - [[Desire Path]] in [[[[CLM]] - Effective individual synthesis systems (seem to mostly) exist (for a select few)]]

            - What we see now is not infrastructure for synthesis. Instead, we see people either resort to all sorts of "hacks" and workarounds, or put in a substantial amount of work to "mine" publications for what they need (for an evocative example of this, see [[@knightEnslavedTrappedData2019]]). We have a whole cottage industry that is dedicated to fueling workarounds of this sort, for systematic reviewing. While these hacks often work well enough for the task at hand, they are rarely transferred in systematic ways across projects and people, violating the dimensions of "reach or scope" and "embodiment of standards", laid out by [[@starStepsEcologyInfrastructure1996]].

    - most academic studies aren't set up to be able to evaluate these, because we need serious usage. on the flip sides, industry folks either aren't sharing data, or aren't collecting it

    - so we lack a good understanding, beyond weak circumstantial/anecdotal evidence of the value of these design patterns
