- one way to do this is by analyzing the [[ðŸ§± cost structure]]

    - example: [[[[EVD]] - Starbucks baristas used a paper cup to support complex coordination to reduce the cost structure of creating complex drinks in a tight, multi-tasking and interruption-intensive environment - [[@kirshMultitaskingCostStructure2005]]]]

    - but be careful! make sure you take the whole environment into account wiht sufficient complexity: [[[[CL]] - cost structure analysis that assumes single cost metric and separable tasks is insufficient for modeling the cost structure of an environment and how designs might shape this structure]]

    - this is related to the idea of [[[[CLM]] - Where possible, design systems, not tools]]
- also be careful to observe the actual [[technologies-in-practice]], not just the tech itself. see [[@orlikowskiUsingTechnologyConstituting2000]]
- and be mindful if you're trying to measure impact on ideas, that [[[[CLM]] - The notion of an 'idea' is very complicated]]
- closely depends on the answer to [[[[QUE]] - Is it possible to measure creativity in a scientifically precise way? If so, how?]]

    - If the answer is no, or not really, then we should be quite skeptical of experimental evidence. This is the basic consensus in [[@shneidermanCreativitySupportTools2006]], recommending [[Multi-dimensional InDepth Long-term Case Studies (MILC Studies)]] instead as a way to figure out if creativity support is happening.

    - ## key points ((One block for each result or claim of interest. we'll refactor this together into EVD notes))

        - high-level: [[[[CL]] - cost structure analysis that assumes single cost metric and separable tasks is insufficient for modeling the cost structure of an environment and how designs might shape this structure]]. this is supported by two basic claims

            - kirsh also provides an example case study, built from ethnographic research with some Starbucks baristas, that [illustrates]([[SupportedBy]]) how the two core assumptions of "single cost metric" and "separable and additive task environments". he analyzed the complex, multi-tasking work of baristas at Starbucks, and how the paper cup was developed to support work in this environment, and shows how under a vanilla cost metric conceptualization, the value of the cup is very unclear: why would they have it? but a modified cost structure perspective based on the two arguments above makes clear the value of the cup.

                - ### summary ((nest details and screenshots (e.g., key figures, quotes) under here. also discuss possible critiques/claims. create source CLM notes for author conclusions (if you like), or reference other CLMs that we have that engage with this)): [[[[EVD]] - Starbucks baristas used a paper cup to support complex coordination to reduce the cost structure of creating complex drinks in a tight, multi-tasking and interruption-intensive environment - [[@kirshMultitaskingCostStructure2005]]]]

                - ### grounding context ((block ref in major methods details from the source methods / context block we might need later to make sense of this result, particularly as they might conflict with others.))

            - 1: within a task environment, we ^^need to have multiple notions of cost structure to capture what is going on^^. one reason is simply that this is the reality of the environment; but another is that this is much more helpful to designers who want to reshape that environment for the agent!

            - 2: we can't really encapsulate *and* separate (and then additively combine) costs from different task environments: the ^^modal case in real environments is multitasking, and a substantial amount of "inter-task" work is done to manage this^^, to try to make tasks that are actually not separable (and thus interfere with each other), approximately separable.

                - this argument is primarily made by a quasi-formal analysis and proof by counterexample, on pp. 4-6 (sections "waht si the environment of activity" and "superposition of task environments"): need to come back to this later. the argument is subtle here, but it hinges on the assumption of linear separability and additivity of tasks (and shows that the tasks are in fact not separable, informationally, or physically, at least in the starbucks case), and that because of htis, people do all kinds of extra-task work to manage this non-separation, and hte cost structure doesn't account for this because traditional cost structure analysis would put taht as out of scope (not in the "task environment", strictly speaking)

                - it's summarized at the end concisely here:

    - ## side notes ((where are the authors coming from? any useful "breadcrumbs" (e.g., other theoretical frameworks, authors, papers) we can follow up on? anything else that stands out?))

        - key influences:

            - russell, card, etc. re: [[ðŸ§± cost structure]]

        - main thing: critiquing cost structure (but not to throw it out!)

            - 1: multiple cost metrics - real task environments have several orthogonal ones. this one i think is.... simpler?

            - 2: not sure what exactly he is getting at here

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FDRn2Wz4eR-.png?alt=media&token=e4b8289e-b02d-486f-a752-e436662ad560)

        - concept of environment here is key to the original [[ðŸ§± cost structure]] conceptualization - not just a tool! although kirsh later goes on to argue that it can't be a strict task environment in the formal sense of cost structure analysis (assuming single tasks, or if multiple, separable, superpositioned tasks, and single cost metric).

        - "productivity" = more output per unit time? better recovery and resumption? enable more complex output? flow?
