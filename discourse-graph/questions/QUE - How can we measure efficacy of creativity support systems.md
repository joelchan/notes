- one way to do this is by analyzing the [[ðŸ§± cost structure]]

    - example: [[EVD - Starbucks baristas used a paper cup to support complex coordination to reduce the cost struct...ght, multi-tasking and interruption-intensive environment - @kirshMultitaskingCostStructure2005]]

    - but be careful! make sure you take the whole environment into account wiht sufficient complexity: [[CL - cost structure analysis that assumes single cost metric and separable tasks is insufficient for modeling the cost structure of an environment and how designs might shape this structure]]

    - this is related to the idea of [[CLM - Where possible, design systems, not tools]]
- also be careful to observe the actual [[technologies-in-practice]]
- and be mindful if you're trying to measure impact on ideas, that [[CLM - The notion of an 'idea' is very complicated]]
- closely depends on the answer to [[QUE - Is it possible to measure creativity in a scientifically precise way If so, how]]

    - If the answer is no, or not really, then we should be quite skeptical of experimental evidence. This is the basic consensus in [[@shneidermanCreativitySupportTools2006]]
