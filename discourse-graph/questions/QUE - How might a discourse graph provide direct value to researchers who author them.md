    - for you

        - **talkback**: extra level of making your ideas and arguments (and their relative strengths and weaknesses) explicit

            - see, e.g., [[Iris van Rooij]]'s [thoughts](https://twitter.com/IrisVanRooij/status/1416873848457289731?s=20) on the related exercise of computational modeling

        - **better analysis and synthesis**: identifying/revealing key contradictions and using [[context queries]] to explore possible resolutions of contradictions

        - **lowered starting energy for combinatorial exploration/extension**: creatively reusing and recombining (explore related questions and collect and combine relevant claims and evidence)

- big uncertainty right now as we build the [synthesis extension]([[bet/[[D/Synthesis Infrastructure]]: it is possible to write close to prose but seamlessly translate to queryable, shareable discourse graph formalisms in the backend]]): [what direct value might accrue for people]([[[[QUE]] - How might a discourse graph provide direct value to researchers who author them?]]) (given realistic assumptions about variations in quality) from the elements of a [[[[PTN]] - discourse graph]]?

    - seems clearer that having some special marking and content of the **elements** is useful

    - what's less clear is what value we might get from the **relations**, especially given varying levels of quality.

        - i like the idea of [[[[PTN]] - representational talkback]] a lot as a design prompt

        - but i'm wondering if the value of the relation map is less for myself and more for others. which makes me nervous. but maybe it's not just others, but me and others: finding ways to collaborate and converge?

    - this is a classic [[riskiest risks]]. i think the thing to do is to use the extension right now as a probe, and schedule a bunch of interviews. best use of time i think.

        - {{[[DONE]]}} write up pitch and ask for interviews with academic roamers #next
