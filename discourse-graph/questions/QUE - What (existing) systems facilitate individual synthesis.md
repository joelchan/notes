- # Synthesis

    - Builds on [[[[CLM]] - Effective individual synthesis systems (seem to mostly) exist (for a select few)]]

    - [[[[CLM]] - Scholars repurpose qualitative data analysis software to facilitate synthesis]]

    - Subquestion: [[[[QUE]] - What user behaviors are scholars doing already that specifies structure for synthesis?]]

        - This should draw on [[WP: JCDL Where the semantic publishing rubber meets the scholarly practice road]]

    - Re: the data structure to operate on

        - **COMPRESSION**: [[[[CLM]] - A synthesis system needs to operate on a unit of analysis that is more granular than a publication]]

            - [[SupportedBy]]

                - [[[[CLM]] - A synthesis system needs to support manipulation of scholarly claims]]

                    - [[[[CLM]] - Scholarly argumentation operates on atomic statements and concepts as fundamental units]]

                        - [[SupportedBy]]

                            - [[[[EVD]] - Four positivist epistemological models from philosophy of science, including Popper, emphasized scientific statements as a core component of scientific knowledge - [[@harsDesigningScientificKnowledge2001]]]]

                    - [[[[CLM]] - Scientists read strategically, not linearly]]

                        - [[SupportedBy]]

                            - [[[[EVD]] - Scientists more often nonlinearly read subsections of papers for findings, hypotheses or other information, rather than linearly reading whole documents - [[@ribaupierreExtractingDiscourseElements2017]]]]

                - [[[[EVD]] - Almost half of the pages in Darwin's notebooks were excised - [[@herbertRedNotebookCharles1980]]]]

        - **CONTEXT**: [[[[CLM]] - Contextualizability is necessary for synthesis]] - [[[[PTN]] - flexible compression]]

            - First-principles/theory: [[[[CLM]] - Knowledge must be recontextualized to be usefully reused]]

                - [Evidence]([[SupportedBy]]) in scholarly domain

                    - [[@blakeCollaborativeInformationSynthesis2006]]

                        - [[@blakeCollaborativeInformationSynthesis2006]]: director of the public health group estimated that she spent ~3 hrs per article to extract [[context]] information required  for a particular [[systematic review]]

                        - some types of [[context]] information were more contextual, depending on the particular "hypothesis projection" of the review, which varied across the lifecycle of the project studied (e.g., location of medical condition, amount of exposure, confounding risk factors), while others were more constant regardless of hypothesis (e.g., study- and population-context information)

                    - [[@morabitoManagingContextScholarly2021]] context

            - [[scholarly primitives]] work that includes [[[[CLM]] - Scholars constantly need to reread during a literature review]]

                - [[@oharaStudentReadersUse1998]] re-reading

    - Re: behaviors:

        - **SENSEMAKING**: [[[[CLM]] - Synthesis is sensemaking on "hard mode"]], which includes both [[ðŸ§± foraging]] (search), and [[ðŸ§± sensemaking]]

            - We see this in intelligence analysis, but also in some studies of [[scholarly workflows]], most notably our own [[@qianOpeningBlackBox2020]], where we saw a [very similar looping pattern](![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FTyrIIDkvzA.png?alt=media&token=7b755a9e-2446-4b70-91de-831774d83b7f)) to the [[Notional Model of Sensemaking]]

        - **INCREMENTAL FORMALIZATION**: [[[[CLM]] - [[[[PTN]] - incremental formalization]] can mitigate risks of formalism in interactive systems]]

        - Selection criteria for epistemology texts: 1) broad and comprehensive, and 2) had an impact on practice of research. But I don't see how this selection criteria is borne out in the selected texts, except maybe [[@popperLogicScientificDiscovery1959]]; no evidence is provided to support the claim that these selected texts meet the stated criteria. So I'm going to put a big asterisk on this until I can confirm it with other stuff. The good thing is that the core statement about statements does sort of pass the smell test, by being consistent with other lines of evidence.

            - [[Mario Bunge]] sort of passes the smell test by having some presence on the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] (across [105 documents](https://plato.stanford.edu/search/searcher.py?query=mario+bunge) related to philosophy of science). That doesn't address the second criteria though, although perhaps only in a loose way.

            - design: within-subjects, [[Latin square]] rotation across 3 [tasks](tasks: three tasks: find definitions of "feminism", find findings of studies that have addressed issue of gender inequality in academia, and gender equality in terms of salary) vs. 2 [system variants](((5OAeQgh2B)))

        - [[[[EVD]] - Scientists more often nonlinearly read subsections of papers for findings, hypotheses or other information, rather than linearly reading whole documents - [[@ribaupierreExtractingDiscourseElements2017]]]]

        - [scientists](setting: 1410 documents in gender studies; 8 scientists (4 gender studies, 4 other fields)) who [compared](((I_uXzCuyy))) an [enhanced faceted search engine](((5OAeQgh2B))) (with ability to search a large corpus of articles by discourse elements) to a regular keyword search system in terms of efficacy for various [targeted search tasks](((6HYDEe9e3))), [self-reported](((pDK5Rlynx))) a significantly higher signal-to-noise ratio in results with the faceted search system compared to the keyword search system

            - Very similar to [[@harsDesigningScientificKnowledge2001]]'s synthesis, although they don't cite him

        - Powerful #example-of a complex query that can't be answered in existing document-centric infrastructure: "Find all the findings that analyse why the number of women in academia falls more sharply than the number of men after their first child, using qualitative and quantitative methodologies"

    - Evidence to turn into... evidence:

        - {{[[DONE]]}} [[@harsDesigningScientificKnowledge2001]] synthesized four major objectivist epistemological models of scientific knowledge from [[Philosophy of Science]], including Popper [[@popperLogicScientificDiscovery1959]], Nagel [[@nagelStructureScienceProblems1979]], Dubin [[@dubinTheoryBuilding1978]], and Bunge [[@bungePhilosophyScience1998]], and demonstrated that they all model argumentation in terms of scientists building systems of scientific statements, which are composed of relationships between concepts.

        - [[@qianOpeningBlackBox2020]]

            - cross-source synthesis

        - {{[[DONE]]}} [[@ribaupierreExtractingDiscourseElements2017]] Scientists were rarely (on average, about 1/3 of the time at most) interested in reading the whole paper; instead they are interested in specific elements, such as a finding, a method, a hypothesis, or a definition (p.5) #Atomicity
