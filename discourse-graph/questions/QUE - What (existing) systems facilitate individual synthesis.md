- # Synthesis

    - Builds on [[[[CLM]] - Effective individual synthesis systems (seem to mostly) exist (for a select few)]]

    - [[[[CLM]] - Scholars repurpose qualitative data analysis software to facilitate synthesis]]

    - Subquestion: [[[[QUE]] - What user behaviors are scholars doing already that specifies structure for synthesis?]]

        - This should draw on [[WP: JCDL Where the semantic publishing rubber meets the scholarly practice road]]

    - Re: the data structure to operate on

        - **COMPRESSION**: [[[[CLM]] - A synthesis system needs to operate on a unit of analysis that is more granular than a publication]]

            - [[SupportedBy]]

                - [[[[CLM]] - A synthesis system needs to support manipulation of scholarly claims]]

                    - [[[[CLM]] - Scholarly argumentation operates on atomic statements and concepts as fundamental units]]

                        - [[SupportedBy]]

                            - [[[[EVD]] - Four positivist epistemological models from philosophy of science, including Popper, emphasized scientific statements as a core component of scientific knowledge - [[@harsDesigningScientificKnowledge2001]]]]

                    - [[[[CLM]] - Scientists read strategically, not linearly]]

                        - [[SupportedBy]]

                            - [[[[EVD]] - Scientists more often nonlinearly read subsections of papers for findings, hypotheses or other information, rather than linearly reading whole documents - [[@ribaupierreExtractingDiscourseElements2017]]]]

            - [[SupportedBy]]

                - [[[[EVD]] - Almost half of the pages in Darwin's notebooks were excised - [[@herbertRedNotebookCharles1980]]]]

        - **CONTEXT**: [[[[CLM]] - Contextualizability is necessary for synthesis]] - [[[[PTN]] - flexible compression]]

            - First-principles/theory: [[[[CLM]] - Knowledge must be recontextualized to be usefully reused]]

                - [Evidence]([[SupportedBy]]) in scholarly domain

                    - [[@blakeCollaborativeInformationSynthesis2006]]

                        - [[@blakeCollaborativeInformationSynthesis2006]]: director of the public health group estimated that she spent ~3 hrs per article to extract [[context]] information required  for a particular [[systematic review]]

                        - some types of [[context]] information were more contextual, depending on the particular "hypothesis projection" of the review, which varied across the lifecycle of the project studied (e.g., location of medical condition, amount of exposure, confounding risk factors), while others were more constant regardless of hypothesis (e.g., study- and population-context information)

                    - [[@morabitoManagingContextScholarly2021]] context

            - [[scholarly primitives]] work that includes [[[[CLM]] - Scholars constantly need to reread during a literature review]]

                - [[@oharaStudentReadersUse1998]] re-reading

    - Re: behaviors:

        - **SENSEMAKING**: [[[[CLM]] - Synthesis is sensemaking on "hard mode"]], which includes both [[ðŸ§± foraging]] (search), and [[ðŸ§± sensemaking]]

            - We see this in intelligence analysis, but also in some studies of [[scholarly workflows]], most notably our own [[@qianOpeningBlackBox2020]], where we saw a [very similar looping pattern](![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FTyrIIDkvzA.png?alt=media&token=7b755a9e-2446-4b70-91de-831774d83b7f)) to the [[Notional Model of Sensemaking]]

        - **INCREMENTAL FORMALIZATION**: [[[[CLM]] - [[[[PTN]] - incremental formalization]] can mitigate risks of formalism in interactive systems]]
