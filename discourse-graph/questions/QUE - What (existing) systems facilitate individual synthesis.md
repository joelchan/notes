- # Synthesis

    - Builds on [[CLM - Effective individual synthesis systems (seem to mostly) exist (for a select few)]]

    - [[CLM - Scholars repurpose qualitative data analysis software to facilitate synthesis]]

    - Subquestion: [[QUE - What user behaviors are scholars doing already that specifies structure for synthesis]]

        - This should draw on [[WP JCDL Where the semantic publishing rubber meets the scholarly practice road]]

    - Re: the data structure to operate on

        - **COMPRESSION**: [[CLM - A synthesis system needs to operate on a unit of analysis that is more granular than a publication]]

            - [[SupportedBy]]

                - [[CLM - A synthesis system needs to support manipulation of scholarly claims]]

                    - [[CLM - Scholarly argumentation operates on atomic statements and concepts as fundamental units]]

                        - [[SupportedBy]]

                            - [[EVD - Four positivist epistemological models from philosophy of science, including Popper, emphasiz... statements as a core component of scientific knowledge - @harsDesigningScientificKnowledge2001]]

                    - [[CLM - Scientists read strategically, not linearly]]

                        - [[SupportedBy]]

                            - [[EVD - Scientists more often nonlinearly read subsections of papers for findings, hypotheses or othe...ion, rather than linearly reading whole documents - @ribaupierreExtractingDiscourseElements2017]]

            - [[SupportedBy]]

                - [[EVD - Almost half of the pages in Darwin's notebooks were excised - @herbertRedNotebookCharles1980]]

        - **CONTEXT**: [[CLM - Contextualizability is necessary for synthesis]]

            - First-principles/theory: [[CLM - Knowledge must be recontextualized to be usefully reused]]

                - [Evidence]([[SupportedBy]]

                        - [[@blakeCollaborativeInformationSynthesis2006]]

                        - some types of [[context]]

                    - [[@morabitoManagingContextScholarly2021]]

            - [[scholarly primitives]]

                - [[@oharaStudentReadersUse1998]]

    - Re: behaviors:

        - **SENSEMAKING**: [[CLM - Synthesis is sensemaking on hard mode]]

            - We see this in intelligence analysis, but also in some studies of [[scholarly workflows]]

        - **INCREMENTAL FORMALIZATION**: [[CLM - PTN - incremental formalization can mitigate risks of formalism in interactive systems]]
