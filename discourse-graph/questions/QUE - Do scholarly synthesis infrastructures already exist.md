    - Description

        - [[Playground Systems for collective synthesis]]

        - [[CLM - Effective individual synthesis systems (seem to mostly) exist (for a select few)]]

        - The history of attempts at synthesis infrastructures is vast.

        - We have a thriving space of [[standards]]

            - [[compression]]

            - The property of [[context]]

            - The idea of formal semantics and [[composability]]

        - The history of *successful* attempts is... unclear? It's certainly not mainstream yet, at least in my experience. That is what we mean by infrastructure. No one "inherits" an infrastructure yet, at least to my knowledge.

        - Let's look at some examples.

            - The earliest ones in the computing era:

                - [[sysMemex]]

                - [[sysXanadu]]

            - Within the sciences / scholarship, led by bioinformatics, best are under the rubric of "genuine" [[semantic publishing]]

                - [[stdNanopublications]]

                - [[stdMicropublication]]

                - [[stdBEL]]

                - [[stdSWAN]]

                - [[Scholarly HTML]]

                - [[Structured Digital Abstracts]]

                - [[digital libraries]]

                - [[standardClaims]]

                - [[ART - Compendium]]

                    - More generally, there is a set of projects in this space around the orbit of the [[Knowledge Media Institute]]

                        - [[Jack Park]]

                            - See, e.g., [[@parkKnowledgeGardeningKnowledge2009]]

                - [[stdResearch Objects]]

                - [[Enhanced Publications]]

            - Other more recent ones

        - important to think through more carefully why [[sysXanadu]]

        - What we see now is not infrastructure for synthesis. Instead, we see people either resort to all sorts of "hacks" and workarounds, or put in a substantial amount of work to "mine" publications for what they need (for an evocative example of this, see [[@knightEnslavedTrappedData2019]]

        - Conversely, we see the infrastructure that people do rely on (e.g., Google Scholar, Web of Science, and so on) consistently breaking down and thereby becoming visible when people try to use it for difficult [[synthesis]]

        - It's important to recognize that these are not "one-time" costs either: scientific problems will require many such queries, and likely spawn new queries as projects evolve and more is learned. We would like for there to not be a disincentive to explore new directions and perspectives on your work as it evolves, simply because it is so arduous to find what is known about it.

        - It's not that we have made no progress! Indeed, the [[semantic publishing]]

        - Yet, on the whole, we're not seeing nearly as much of this transformation as we'd like. [[CLM - Sustaining authorship for semantic publishing is hard]]
