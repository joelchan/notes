    - Description

        - [[Playground: Systems for collective synthesis]]

        - [[[[CLM]] - Effective individual synthesis systems (seem to mostly) exist (for a select few)]]. But what about the collaborative/collective case?

        - The history of attempts at synthesis infrastructures is vast.

        - We have a thriving space of [[standards]] for underpinning [[infrastructure]] for [[synthesis]]

            - [[compression]] resembles the core concerns of standards like [[std/Micropublication]]s [[@clarkMicropublicationsSemanticModel2014]] and [[std/Nanopublications]] [[@grothAnatomyNanopublication2010]], which were developed in part to enable reasoning over more granular units of knowledge.

            - The property of [[context]] resembles the goal of representing evidence [[@brushSEPIOSemanticModel2016]], [[uncertainty]] [[@dewaardFormalisingUncertaintyOntology2012]], and [[provenance]] of publications [[@grothAnatomyNanopublication2010]].

            - The idea of formal semantics and [[composability]] connect well to the core vision of enabling machine assisted-reasoning and higher-level synthesis in the [[Semantic Web]] [[@kuhnGenuineSemanticPublishing2017]], [[@berners-leePublishingSemanticWeb2001]]

        - The history of *successful* attempts is... unclear? It's certainly not mainstream yet, at least in my experience. That is what we mean by infrastructure. No one "inherits" an infrastructure yet, at least to my knowledge.

        - Let's look at some examples.

            - The earliest ones in the computing era:

                - [[sys/Memex]]

                - [[sys/Xanadu]]

            - Within the sciences / scholarship, led by bioinformatics, best are under the rubric of "genuine" [[semantic publishing]] (term I've seen from #[[@kuhnGenuineSemanticPublishing2017]])

                - [[std/Nanopublications]]

                - [[std/Micropublication]]

                - [[std/BEL]]

                - [[std/SWAN]]

                - [[Scholarly HTML]]

                - [[Structured Digital Abstracts]]

                - [[digital libraries]]

                - [[standard/Claims]]

                - [[[[ART]] - Compendium]]

                    - More generally, there is a set of projects in this space around the orbit of the [[Knowledge Media Institute]], led for a time by [[Simon Buckingham Shum]]

                        - [[Jack Park]] is related to this thread, and now in the Telegram group for [[Digital Garden]]ing

                            - See, e.g., [[@parkKnowledgeGardeningKnowledge2009]]

                - [[std/Research Objects]]

                - [[Enhanced Publications]]

            - Other more recent ones

        - important to think through more carefully why [[sys/Xanadu]] and the many [[Semantic Web]] and [[[[PTN]] - Hypertext]] or [[sys/Memex]] related projects have “failed”.

        - What we see now is not infrastructure for synthesis. Instead, we see people either resort to all sorts of "hacks" and workarounds, or put in a substantial amount of work to "mine" publications for what they need (for an evocative example of this, see [[@knightEnslavedTrappedData2019]]). We have a whole cottage industry that is dedicated to fueling workarounds of this sort, for systematic reviewing. While these hacks often work well enough for the task at hand, they are rarely transferred in systematic ways across projects and people, violating the dimensions of "reach or scope" and "embodiment of standards", laid out by [[@starStepsEcologyInfrastructure1996]].

        - Conversely, we see the infrastructure that people do rely on (e.g., Google Scholar, Web of Science, and so on) consistently breaking down and thereby becoming visible when people try to use it for difficult [[synthesis]] tasks, especially across disciplines. They also often cannot really transfer their [[bricolage]] solutions from previous tasks or projects to these new domains they have to navigate.

        - It's important to recognize that these are not "one-time" costs either: scientific problems will require many such queries, and likely spawn new queries as projects evolve and more is learned. We would like for there to not be a disincentive to explore new directions and perspectives on your work as it evolves, simply because it is so arduous to find what is known about it.

        - It's not that we have made no progress! Indeed, the [[semantic publishing]] revolution is indeed underway! We see encouraging developments, in [[bioinformatics]] and [[archeology]], for example.

        - Yet, on the whole, we're not seeing nearly as much of this transformation as we'd like. [[[[CLM]] - Sustaining authorship for [[semantic publishing]] is hard]]
