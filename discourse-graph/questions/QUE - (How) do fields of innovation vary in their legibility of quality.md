    - # Synthesis

        - After looking at both [[@coleHierarchySciences1983]]

        - It was noisy in Cole's time, with limited methodological ability to do large-scale bibliometric analyses. Lots of null effects, but this was with small datasets; strongest effect was looking at ["core" of knowledge]([[CLM - There is systematic variation in consensus of the core knowledge of fields - @coleHierarchySciences1983]]

        - After bibliometrics became a thing, in Fanelli's era, we start to see more systematic evidence. Fanelli reviews some, and offers [some of their own]([[EVD - statistically significant but small differences in bibliometric measures of consensus across ...cal, hard and soft biological, and social sciences  - @fanelliBibliometricEvidenceHierarchy2013]]

        - Throughout this thread, there is a consistent hypothesized hierarchy of domains, from physical sciences to biological sciences to social sciences. Fanelli thinks that math and humanities are weird beasts because the fundamental dynamic has to do with physical constraints on what is studied and how it can be studied. Not obvious that this applies for math and humanities, although the patterns sort of line up ok, with math above physics, and humanities below social sciences.

        - There is more still to read, with some evidence around consensus around the meaning of terms (see [[@hjorlandEpistemologySociocognitivePerspective2002]]

        - I think it would be reasonable to use the [orderings](((CaQWGh1pG))) in [[@fanelliBibliometricEvidenceHierarchy2013]]

        - ## Themes and claims

            - [[CLM - Scientific fields vary substantially in terms of ease of consensus on judging what constitutes a valuable new contribution]]

                - [[@coleHierarchySciences1983]]

                    - [[CLM - There is no systematic variation in consensus across fields on judging quality of contributions to research frontiers - @coleHierarchySciences1983]]

                - But [[@coleHierarchySciences1983]]

                    - [[EVD - undergrad 1980s textbooks in physics and chemistry cited far fewer texts compare to sociology textbooks - @coleHierarchySciences1983]]

                    - [[EVD - most undergrad 1980s textbooks in physics and chemistry cited work published before 1960; sociology texts mostly cited work published after 1960 - @coleHierarchySciences1983]]

                - #SupportedBy

                    - [[EVD - statistically significant but small differences in bibliometric measures of consensus across ...cal, hard and soft biological, and social sciences  - @fanelliBibliometricEvidenceHierarchy2013]]

            - [[CLM - There is systematic variation in consensus of the core knowledge of fields - @coleHierarchySciences1983]]

                - This is a more qualified version of the [general positive claim]([[CLM - Scientific fields vary substantially in terms of ease of consensus on judging what constitutes a valuable new contribution]]

                - And this is [[SupportedBy]]
