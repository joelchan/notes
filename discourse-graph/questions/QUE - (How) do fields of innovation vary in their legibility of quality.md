- #Question

    - # Synthesis

        - After looking at both [[@coleHierarchySciences1983]] and [[@fanelliBibliometricEvidenceHierarchy2013]] in some detail, I think the following claim is reasonably likely: there is some systematic variation between disciplines (mostly physical sciences, biological sciences, and social sciences, in that order), but the difference is small.

        - It was noisy in Cole's time, with limited methodological ability to do large-scale bibliometric analyses. Lots of null effects, but this was with small datasets; strongest effect was looking at ["core" of knowledge]([[[[CLM]] - There is systematic variation in consensus of the core knowledge of fields - [[@coleHierarchySciences1983]]]]), with textbook content as a proxy (we see, roughly, variations in [number]([[[[EVD]] - undergrad 1980s textbooks in physics and chemistry cited far fewer texts compare to sociology textbooks - [[@coleHierarchySciences1983]]]]) and [age]([[[[EVD]] - most undergrad 1980s textbooks in physics and chemistry cited work published before 1960; sociology texts mostly cited work published after 1960 - [[@coleHierarchySciences1983]]]]) of references cited in physics/chemistry vs. sociology textbooks of that era), but this was a pilot analysis.

        - After bibliometrics became a thing, in Fanelli's era, we start to see more systematic evidence. Fanelli reviews some, and offers [some of their own]([[[[EVD]] - statistically significant but small differences in bibliometric measures of consensus across papers in physical, hard and soft biological, and social sciences  - [[@fanelliBibliometricEvidenceHierarchy2013]]]]). But in general the differences do not seem to be super large; the fact that they were noisier in Cole's era, and statistically reliable but small in absolute effect size in Fanelli's era, makes me think the effect sizes are small, at least at the frontier, as Cole argued.

        - Throughout this thread, there is a consistent hypothesized hierarchy of domains, from physical sciences to biological sciences to social sciences. Fanelli thinks that math and humanities are weird beasts because the fundamental dynamic has to do with physical constraints on what is studied and how it can be studied. Not obvious that this applies for math and humanities, although the patterns sort of line up ok, with math above physics, and humanities below social sciences.

        - There is more still to read, with some evidence around consensus around the meaning of terms (see [[@hjorlandEpistemologySociocognitivePerspective2002]] on [[paradigmatic relevance]] and [[@mcmahanAmbiguityEngagement2018]] on [[ambiguity]] in language). There's also a fun study on the degree to which scientists consult their peers before submitting, as a proxy for a priori confidence in the quality of work [[@sulsSocialComparisonSocial1983]]. Lots more in references of [[@coleHierarchySciences1983]] and [[@fanelliBibliometricEvidenceHierarchy2013]]. Important note: I haven't directly processed these references yet, except for [[@mcmahanAmbiguityEngagement2018]].

        - I think it would be reasonable to use the [orderings](((CaQWGh1pG))) in [[@fanelliBibliometricEvidenceHierarchy2013]], which are broadly consistent across studies of "hierarchy of sciences", as a first pass.

        - ## Themes and claims

            - [[[[CLM]] - Scientific fields vary substantially in terms of ease of consensus on judging what constitutes a valuable new contribution]]

                - [[@coleHierarchySciences1983]] basically clarifies and sharpens this claim because they don't find any evidence for this, and instead have reviewed a bunch of papers and conclude the [opposite]([[Opposed By]]) in terms of the research frontier:

                    - [[[[CLM]] - There is no systematic variation in consensus across fields on judging quality of contributions to research frontiers - [[@coleHierarchySciences1983]]]]

                - But [[@coleHierarchySciences1983]] also find some limited/scoped evidence in [support]([[SupportedBy]]):

                    - [[[[EVD]] - undergrad 1980s textbooks in physics and chemistry cited far fewer texts compare to sociology textbooks - [[@coleHierarchySciences1983]]]]

                    - [[[[EVD]] - most undergrad 1980s textbooks in physics and chemistry cited work published before 1960; sociology texts mostly cited work published after 1960 - [[@coleHierarchySciences1983]]]]

                - #SupportedBy

                    - [[[[EVD]] - statistically significant but small differences in bibliometric measures of consensus across papers in physical, hard and soft biological, and social sciences  - [[@fanelliBibliometricEvidenceHierarchy2013]]]]

            - [[[[CLM]] - There is systematic variation in consensus of the core knowledge of fields - [[@coleHierarchySciences1983]]]]

                - This is a more qualified version of the [general positive claim]([[[[CLM]] - Scientific fields vary substantially in terms of ease of consensus on judging what constitutes a valuable new contribution]])

                - And this is [[SupportedBy]]

                    - [[[[EVD]] - undergrad 1980s textbooks in physics and chemistry cited far fewer texts compare to sociology textbooks - [[@coleHierarchySciences1983]]]]

                    - [[[[EVD]] - most undergrad 1980s textbooks in physics and chemistry cited work published before 1960; sociology texts mostly cited work published after 1960 - [[@coleHierarchySciences1983]]]]
