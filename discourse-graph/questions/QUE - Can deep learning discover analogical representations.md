        - current belief: probably not?

        - need to really clarify/sharpen this question: it's too vague atm. i think right now it's a high-level proxy for the question "if we just use the SOTA language models, will that enable us to find analogical ideas/papers across domains?"

        - so basically, the reasoning for being cautious about deep learning per se goes as follows:

            - [[CLM - Analogies are fundamentally about relational similarity]]

            - to reason about similarity between relations, we need to have good representations of relations (e.g., [[relational categories]]

            - [[CLM - Relational categories are almost overwhelmingly expressed as verbs]]

            - therefore, computational models of semantics that do poorly with verbs should also do poorly with relations, and therefore struggle with [[analogy]]

            - one strong representative of deep learning representations of semantics is [[word embeddings]]

            - There is some evidence that [[CLM - Vector-space models of language struggle with relational similarity]]

            - therefore, we are skeptical that deep learning-based semantics (without explicit searching / tuning for relational structure) will succeed at giving us computational [[analogy]]

        - HOWEVER

            - There is some emerging evidence that [[CLM - transformer language models have some analogical reasoning ability]]
