    - Description

        - Related to [[[[CLM]] - Effective individual synthesis systems (seem to mostly) exist (for a select few)]], in that, often a good bit of "semantic publishing work" (at least in proto form) is intrinsically and immediately useful for the sensemaker.

        - What is the scale at which scientists are producing annotations and notes? In other words, what is the untapped opportunity here? What is the "drag coefficient"? How much energy is being "wasted'?

        - Much more data in [[WP: JCDL Where the semantic publishing rubber meets the scholarly practice road]]
