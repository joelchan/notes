- # Synthesis

    - [[Playground: PD diversity tension points]]

    - Goal: we are looking for:

        - explicit observations of tradeoff/tension (i want X, but if do A to go after X, Y goes away and i don't like it)

            - some examples in [[@harringtonDeconstructingCommunityBasedCollaborative2019]]

        - explicit observations of problems (i tried expand PD, but X got in the way)

        - explicit observations of solutions/workarounds/compromises (X was a problem when i tried to expand PD, so I did Y)

            - some examples in [[@walshEquityEqualityAmerican2018]] and [[@pradhanUnderstandingOlderAdults2020]]

        - To inform [[bet/literature synthesis can give new insights into participation-inclusion tradeoffs for PD]]

        - And something else

        - **Layers of interpretation** [[[[CL]] - There is a tension between analyzing participants' direct inputs, and respecting their actual insights (vs. designers' interpretation) that is intensified when working with design partners who struggle to contribute more directly to design artifacts]]

            - There is a tension between analyzing participants' direct inputs, and respecting their actual insights (vs. designers' interpretation) that is intensified when working with design partners who struggle to contribute more directly to design artifacts; this has been observed across such diverse settings as sex trafficiking survivor organizations (gautam, 2018)... (Gautam, 2018; Frauenberger, 2012; lindsay 2012)

                - [[[[EVD]] - Sex-trafficking survivor organization staff members would sometimes speak of and for the survivors when talking about their needs - [[@gautamParticipatoryTensionsWorking2018]]]]

                - [[[[EVD]] - in design sessions with children, there were tensions between interpretation of the participant voice v. the stakeholder [[@frauenbergerInterpretingInputChildren2012b]]]]

                - [[[[EVD]] - Designers inadvertently made assumptions while analyzing transcripts from design sessions which discounted important desires from participants with dementia - [[@lindsayEmpathyParticipatoryDesign2012b]]]]

                - [[@massimiParticipatoryDesignProcess2006]]

        - **Materials and trappings of design** [[[[CL]] - The materials and trappings of design might be an inadvertent barrier to inclusion, though they are useful (or at least perceived as such) for depth of participation in the design process]]

            - [[SupportedBy]]

                - **Materials**: [[[[EVD]] - Low-income, African-American older adults perceived ideation materials used for brainstorming as infantilizing and belittling - [[@harringtonDeconstructingCommunityBasedCollaborative2019]]]]: (e.g., markers, colored pencils, sketch paper)

                - **Assumption/approach of play and "blue sky" ideation**: [[[[EVD]] - Low-income, African-American older adults preferred "realistic" local-governance-based solutions over "blue sky" ideas - [[@harringtonDeconstructingCommunityBasedCollaborative2019]]]]

        - **Here vs. there: dilemma, unintended consequences of in situ codesign** [[[[CL]] - Conducting co-design in situ can broaden who is able to participate, but can also introduce other barriers to depth of participation]]: There is an interesting higher-order tension/dilemma emerging around __where__ PD happens relative to the user population: on the one hand, doing PD in the lab over long periods of time, like in [[Cooperative Inquiry]], maximizes participation depth, but [can put substantial filters on who can participate](also some outside / **logistics** factors putting up barriers to participation), reducing diversity. Going out to where users are is one solution, but that in turn puts an upper limit on participation depth.

                - One reason this is the case is that you end up having to reduce the time spent there, and often end up doing more ad-hoc pairings.

                - But a more subtle, perhaps less obvious issue comes from the **increased presence of extra stakeholders**, who may need to be involved in special ways because of the user population, whether it is for reasons of access, legality, or necessity. [[[[CLM]] - Marginalized user populations may require involvement of extra stakeholders who may complicate hearing the users' voices]]

                        - Examples include sex-trafficking survivor organizations [[@gautamParticipatoryTensionsWorking2018]([[[[EVD]] - Sex-trafficking survivor organization staff members would sometimes speak of and for the survivors when talking about their needs - [[@gautamParticipatoryTensionsWorking2018]]]])], politically appointed local government officials in rural areas [[@ssozi-mugaruraSupportingCommunityNeeds2016]([[[[EVD]] - Intermediaries such as local government officials were necessary for accessing and co-designing with marginalized populations, but the intermediaries sometimes spoke for the people in ways that opposed what they really wanted - [[@ssozi-mugaruraSupportingCommunityNeeds2016]]]]), teachers or helpers of neurodiverse children [[@frauenbergerDesigningSmartObjects2016a]([[[[EVD]] - Teachers and helpers needed to be present in the beginning of PD session to help and make sure children were comfortable but were not needed in future sessions [[@frauenbergerDesigningSmartObjects2016a]]]])], advocates of prisoners [[@tengParticipatoryDesignVirtual2019b]([[[[EVD]] - Working with an advocate within the prison system allowed researchers to navigate bureaucratic hierarchy with relative ease - @tengParticipatoryDesignVirtual2019b]])], or apartment complex authorities on site [[@harringtonDeconstructingCommunityBasedCollaborative2019]([[[[EVD]] - Black and LatinX codesign participants were reluctant to fully disclose past experiences bc they perceived researchers as connected to outsider authorities who could harm them - [[@harringtonDeconstructingCommunityBasedCollaborative2019]]]])]

                        - Their presence changes power dynamics and can lead to [participants' voices being lost in translation]([[[[CLM]] - There is a tension between analyzing participants' direct inputs, and respecting their actual insights (vs. designers' interpretation) that is intensified when working with design partners who struggle to contribute more directly to design artifacts]]) [[@gautamParticipatoryTensionsWorking2018]([[[[EVD]] - Sex-trafficking survivor organization staff members would sometimes speak of and for the survivors when talking about their needs - [[@gautamParticipatoryTensionsWorking2018]]]]), [@frauenbergerInterpretingInputChildren2012b]([[[[EVD]] - in design sessions with children, there were tensions between interpretation of the participant voice v. the stakeholder [[@frauenbergerInterpretingInputChildren2012b]]]])] or negotation.

        - also some outside / **logistics** factors putting up barriers to participation

            - [[[[EVD]] - PD sessions had to be significantly scoped down in both length and focus to accommodate travel and time constraints for children from underserved communities - [[@walshEquityEqualityAmerican2018]]]]

            - [[[[EVD]] - Children from underserved communities were often unable to attend in-lab PD sessions due to travel and time constraints - [[@walshEquityEqualityAmerican2018]]]]

        - Some **(physical / intrinsic) limitations of the participants** can also necessitate changes to the design process that can compromise its quality

            - [[[[EVD]] - physical prototypes were necessary to prompt aid discussion with codesigners with dementia, but also led to fixation on unfinished aspects of the design - [[@lindsayEmpathyParticipatoryDesign2012b]]]]

            - [[[[EVD]] - Due to liabilities of potentially inducing physical illness Usability testing was not possible -[[@tengParticipatoryDesignVirtual2019b]]]]

            - [[[[EVD]] - Design team modified photo elicitation method so sex trafficking survivor participants' faces were not shown, for safety concerns - [[@gautamParticipatoryTensionsWorking2018]]]]

        - There may be **legal/procedural hurdles** to navigate due to the special population

            - [[[[EVD]] - Due to liabilities of potentially inducing physical illness Usability testing was not possible -[[@tengParticipatoryDesignVirtual2019b]]]]

            - [[E - Due to restrictions Prison environments weren't conducive for developing relationships with participants. -@tengParticipatoryDesignVirtual2019b]]

                - One solution is [[[[EVD]] - Working with an advocate within the prison system allowed researchers to navigate bureaucratic hierarchy with relative ease - @tengParticipatoryDesignVirtual2019b]]

        - There may be higher barriers to **self-disclosure** that need to be dealt with?

            - [[[[EVD]] - Black and LatinX codesign participants were reluctant to fully disclose past experiences bc they perceived researchers as connected to outsider authorities who could harm them - [[@harringtonDeconstructingCommunityBasedCollaborative2019]]]]

            - [[[[EVD]] - Low-income, African-American older adults were reluctant to share sensitive health information bc of past mistreatment in research studies by the university hospital - [[@harringtonDeconstructingCommunityBasedCollaborative2019]]]]

            - [[E - young people with neurological vision impairments (NVI) were reluctant to share their difficulties with the vision therapy game for which they had figured out workarounds - @waddingtonParticipatoryDesignTherapeutic2015b]]

            - Some self-disclosure might be very upsetting

                - [[E - researchers were concerned about exposing vulnerability of Young adults with neurological vision impairments (NVI) during the design sessions - @waddingtonParticipatoryDesignTherapeutic2015b]]

                - [[[[EVD]] - Sex trafficking survivors shared concerns about painful experiences from writing their stories in design exercises. A future-focused photo elicitation method seemed to be a viable alternative - @gautamParticipatoryTensionsWorking2018]]

        - There's also something about the **identity** of the design team that can put up barriers

            - Some of this is from history

                - [[[[EVD]] - Black and LatinX codesign participants were skeptical of technological solutions due to past negative experiences with inequitable policies/laws - [[@harringtonDeconstructingCommunityBasedCollaborative2019]]]]

                - [[[[EVD]] - Black and LatinX codesign participants distrusted researchers from the local university due to perceived abandonment after past research studies - [[@harringtonDeconstructingCommunityBasedCollaborative2019]]]]

            - Some of this is from current **associations with other power structures**

            - Which may necessitate moves to create some **separation between the design team and the participants**

                - [[[[EVD]] - Using language to evoke separation between participants with dementia and the design team was sometimes necessary to allow for honest feedback - @lindsayEmpathyParticipatoryDesign2012b]]

        - Other (not sure how to integrate yet)

            - [[[[EVD]] - Designers inadvertently made assumptions while analyzing transcripts from design sessions which discounted important desires from participants with dementia - [[@lindsayEmpathyParticipatoryDesign2012b]]]]

            - [[[[EVD]] - experts who work with young adults with neurological vision impairments (NVI) do not have complete subjective experience of vision impairment and misjudge the difficulty of the vision therapy game - [[@waddingtonParticipatoryDesignTherapeutic2015b]]]]

                            1. This paper reports on studies where teachers from two different preschools incorporated a Bridging Design Prototype (BDP) for concept mapping into classroom activities. Designed under inclusive, participatory, and user-centered principles, the BDP was used to perform observations for assessing an interaction problem and refining the user community profile. The observation findings will inform next stage of product development.

                            1. Teens with complex chronic illnesses have difficulty understanding and articulating symptoms such as pain and emotional distress. Yet, symptom communication plays a central role in clinical care and illness management. To understand how design can help overcome these challenges, we created a visual library of 72 sketched illustrations, informed by the Observations of Daily Living framework along with insights from 11 clinician interviews. We utilized our library with storyboarding techniques, free-form sketching, and interviews, in co-design sessions with 13 pairs of chronically-ill teens and their parents. We found that teens depicted symptoms as being interwoven with narratives of personal and social identity. Teens and parents were enthusiastic about collaboratively-generated, interactive storyboards as a tracking and communication mechanism, and suggested three ways in which they could aid in communication and coordination with informal and formal caregivers. In this paper, we detail these findings, to guide the design of tools for symptom-tracking and incorporation of patient-generated data into pediatric care.

                            1. The design of wearable applications supporting children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorders (ADHD) requires a deep understanding not only of what is possible from a clinical standpoint but also how the children might understand and orient towards wearable technologies, such as a smartwatch. Through a series of participatory design workshops with children with ADHD and their caregivers, we identified tensions and challenges in designing wearable applications supporting the self-regulation of children with ADHD. In this paper, we describe the specific challenges of smartwatches for this population, the balance between self-regulation and co-regulation, and tensions when receiving notifications on a smartwatch in various contexts. These results indicate key considerations-from both the child and caregiver viewpoints-for designing technological interventions supporting children with ADHD.

                            1. Participatory Design (PD) has become a standard methodology in HCI, however, the evaluation of the outcomes of participatory processes is often exclusively driven by researcher defined measures of success. Through our work with autistic children, who have radically different life worlds from our own, it became evident that their criteria for the success of a project are most likely also very different. In order to address the limitations of researcher defined and led evaluations in this context, we developed an approach for participatory evaluation called PEACE (Participatory Evaluation with Autistic ChildrEn). Using this approach, we were able to include autistic children in dedicated evaluation phases through the co-definition of goals and methods, joint processes of data gathering and the co-interpretation of results. We discuss three case studies in which we successfully applied our approach and conclude with a reflection on the novel insights created through participatory evaluation and researchers' roles in such a process.

                            1. Algorithms processing data from wearable sensors promise to more accurately predict risks of falling – a significant concern for older adults. Substantial engineering work is dedicated to increasing the prediction accuracy of these algorithms; yet fewer efforts are dedicated to better engaging users through interactive visualizations in decision-making using these data. We present an investigation of the acceptance of a sensor-based fall risk assessment wearable device. A participatory design was employed to develop a mobile interface providing visualizations of sensor data and algorithmic assessments of fall risks. We then investigated the acceptance of this interface and its potential to motivate behavioural changes through a field deployment, which suggested that the interface and its belt-mounted wearable sensors are perceived as usable. We also found that providing contextual information for fall risk estimation combined with relevant practical fall prevention instructions may facilitate the acceptance of such technologies, potentially leading to behaviour change.

                            1. In this paper, we investigate how people with mobility impairments assess and evaluate accessibility in the built environment and the role of current and emerging location-based technologies therein. We conducted a three-part formative study with 20 mobility impaired participants: a semi-structured interview (Part 1), a participatory design activity (Part 2), and a design probe activity (Part 3). Part 2 and 3 actively engaged our participants in exploring and designing the future of what we call assistive location-based technologies (ALTs) location-based technologies that specifically incorporate accessibility features to support navigating, searching, and exploring the physical world. Our Part 1 findings highlight how existing mapping tools provide accessibility benefits even though often not explicitly designed for such uses. Findings in Part 2 and 3 help identify and uncover useful features of future ALTs. In particular, we synthesize 10 key features and 6 key data qualities. We conclude with ALT design recommendations.

                            1. Reading printed documents and writing on a paper pose a great challenge for visually-impaired people. Existing studies that attempt to solve these challenges are expensive and not feasible in low-income context. Moreover, these studies solve reading and writing problems separately. On the contrary, in this study, we propose FLight, a low-cost reading and writing system for economically less-privileged people. FLight uses ink-based Braille characters as the medium of textual representation. This helps in keeping a compact spatial representation of texts, yet achieving a low-cost status. Additionally, FLight utilizes a low-cost wearable device to enhance ease of reading by visually-impaired people. We conduct a participatory design and iterative evaluation involving five visually-impaired children in Bangladesh for more than 18 months. Our user evaluation reveals that FLight is easy-to-use, and exhibits a potential low-cost solution for economically less-privileged visually-impaired people.

                            1. Health and wellbeing applications increasingly raise ethical issues for design. User-centred and participatory design approaches, while grounded in everyday wisdom, cannot be expected to address ethical reflection consistently, as multiple value systems come into play. We explore the potential of phronesis, a concept from Aristotelian virtue ethics, for mHealth design. Phronesis describes wisdom and judgment garnered from practical experience of specific situations in context. Applied phronesis contributes everyday wisdom to challenging issues for vulnerable target users. Drawing on research into mHealth technologies for psychological wellbeing, we explore how phronesis can inform ethical design. Using a case study on an app for self-reporting symptoms of depression during pregnancy, we present a framework for incorporating a phronetic approach into design, involving: (a) a wide feedback net to capture phronetic input early in design; (b) observing the order of feedback, which directly affects value priorities in design; (c) ethical pluralism recognising different coexisting value systems; (d) acknowledging subjectivity in the disclosure and recognition of individual researcher and participant values. We offer insights into how a phronetic approach can contribute everyday wisdom to designing mHealth technologies to help designers foster the values that promote human flourishing.

                            1. We present the Haptic Wave, a device that allows cross-modal mapping of digital audio to the haptic domain, intended for use by audio producers/engineers with visual impairments. We describe a series of participatory design activities adapted to non-sighted users where the act of prototyping facilitates dialog. A series of workshops scoping user needs, and testing a technology mock up and lo-fidelity prototype fed into the design of a final high-spec prototype. The Haptic Wave was tested in the laboratory, then deployed in real world settings in recording studios and audio production facilities. The cross-modal mapping is kinesthetic and allows the direct manipulation of sound without the translation of an existing visual interface. The research gleans insight into working with users with visual impairments, and transforms perspective to think of them as experts in non-visual interfaces for all users.

                            1. Smartwatches have a large potential to support everyday activities. However, their potential as assistive technologies in inclusive academic environments is unclear. To investigate how smartwatches can support students with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) to perform activities that require emotional and behavioral skills and involve communication, collaboration and planning, we implemented WELI. WELI (Wearable Life) is a wearable application designed to assist young adults with IDDs attending a postsecondary education program. This paper reports on the user-centric design process adopted in the development of WELI, and describes how smartwatches can assist students with IDDs in special education. The results reported are drawn from 8 user studies with 58 participants in total. WELI features include behavioral intervention, mood regulation, reminders, checklists, surveys and rewards. Results indicate that several considerations must be taken into account when designing for students with IDD, and that overall the students are enthusiastic about adopting an innovative smartwatch application in class, as they reacted positively about the technology and features provided.

                            1. Children living with visual impairments (VIs) are increasingly educated in mainstream rather than special schools. But knowledge about the challenges they face in inclusive schooling environments and how to design technology to overcome them remains scarce. We report findings from a field study involving interviews and observations of educators and children with/without VIs in mainstream schools, in which we identified the "teaching assistant bubble" as a potential barrier to group learning, social play and independent mobility. We present co-design activities blending elements of future workshops, multisensory crafting, fictional inquiry and bodystorming, demonstrating that children with and without VIs can jointly lead design processes and explore design spaces reflective of mixed visual abilities and shared experiences. We extend previous research by characterising challenges and opportunities for improving inclusive education of children with VIs in mainstream schools, in terms of balancing assistance and independence, and reflect on the process and outcomes of co-designing with mixed-ability groups in this context.

                            1. Current and emerging participative design practices are providing opportunities for people with intellectual disability to have a say in how technology can best support them and their individual needs. Yet technological experts and designers are not always confident to be included in co-design sessions with people with intellectual disability and often favour less inclusive projects to focus on. In this paper, we present lessons learnt from a series of co-design exercises aimed at designing mobile or web applications to support people with intellectual disability, including a reframing of the concept of reciprocity. We believe these lessons can serve as recommendations for IT experts or IT students, to be encouraged and enabled to design with people with intellectual disability, thus supporting a greater inclusion.

                            1. Public attitudes towards learning disabilities (LDs) are generally reported as positive, inclusive and empathetic. However, these findings do not reflect the lived experiences of people with LDs. To shed light on this disparity, a team of co-researchers with LDs created the first online survey to challenge public understanding of LDs, asking questions in ways that are important to them and represent how they see themselves. Here, we describe and evaluate the process of creating an accessible survey platform and an online survey in a research team consisting of academic and non-academic professionals with and without LDs or autism. Through this inclusive research process, the co-designed survey met the expectations of the co-researchers and was well-received by the initial survey respondents. We reflect on the co-researchers' perspectives following the study completion, and consider the difficulties and advantages we encountered deploying such approaches and their potential implications on future survey data analysis.

                            1. HCI is increasingly working with 'vulnerable' people, yet there is a danger that the label of vulnerability can alienate and stigmatize the people such work aims to support. We report our study investigating the application of interaction design to increase rates of hate crime reporting amongst Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender young people. During design-led workshops, participants expressed ambivalence towards reporting. While recognizing their exposure to hate crime, they simultaneously rejected being identified as victim as implied in the act of reporting. We used visual communication design to depict the young people's ambivalent identities and contribute insights into how these fail and succeed to account for the intersectional, fluid and emergent nature of LGBT identities through the design research process. We argue that by producing ambiguously designed texts alongside conventional outcomes, we 'trouble' our design research narratives as a tactic to disrupt static and reductive understandings of vulnerability within HCI.

                            1. Ghana has a population of over 27 million people, of which 1 in 15 may have a communication disability. The number of speech and language therapists (SLTs) available to support these people remains remarkably small, presenting a major workforce challenge. As an emerging profession, there remain significant challenges around educating the first generation of SLTs. Ghana, however, has a healthy digital infrastructure which can be taken advantage of. We describe a comprehensive study which aimed to co-design a set of locally appropriate digital tools to enhance SLT training in Ghana. We contribute insights into how digital tools could support social learning and the transition from student to independent practitioner and future clinical supervisor. We offer a set of design recommendations for creating an online Community of Practice to enhance continuing professional development.

W focus on adults with ADHD, as they frequently experience difficulties related to such control. We describe the design and current user experience evaluation of TimeOut - a skill-building assistive technology to be used by adults with ADHD to improve long-term mastery of self-regulatory abilities. TimeOut, in its current iteration, consists of a wristband monitoring physiological signals, visualization of these signals, an algorithm to prompt interventions, and the delivery of a skill-building exercise on a mobile phone.

                            1. Despite increased focus on classroom support, children with cognitive and learning disorders still face high levels of social exclusion in integrative mainstream schools due to impairments in social communication. Following previous structured social technological interventions which have proved useful in increasing social skills of children with Autism, this research outlines the methodologies followed to develop a virtual environment system which may rapidly transform a standard classroom into an interactive play space. Research methods included field studies, stakeholder interviews, requirements gathering, prototype construction and feedback, and usability testing. This research in developing classroom technologies stands to pose significant benefits to this group of individuals at risk of social exclusion due to cognitive or learning conditions.

                        1. Abstract

                            1. Algorithmic systems increasingly shape information people are exposed to as well as influence decisions about employment, finances, and other opportunities. In some cases, algorithmic systems may be more or less favorable to certain groups or individuals, sparking substantial discussion of algorithmic fairness in public policy circles, academia, and the press. We broaden this discussion by exploring how members of potentially affected communities feel about algorithmic fairness. We conducted workshops and interviews with 44 participants from several populations traditionally marginalized by categories of race or class in the United States. While the concept of algorithmic fairness was largely unfamiliar, learning about algorithmic (un)fairness elicited negative feelings that connect to current national discussions about racial injustice and economic inequality. In addition to their concerns about potential harms to themselves and society, participants also indicated that algorithmic fairness (or lack thereof) could substantially affect their trust in a company or product.

                            1. Capturing and describing the multi-faceted experiences autistic children have with technologies provides a unique research challenge. Approaches based on pragmatist notions of experience, which mostly rely on empathy, are particularly limited if used alone. To address this we have developed an approach that combines Actor-Network Theory and Critical Discourse Analysis. Drawing on this approach, we discuss the experiences autistic children had with technologies resulting from the collaborative design process in the OutsideTheBox project. We construct a holistic picture of the experience by drawing on diverse data sources ranging from interviews to log-data, and most importantly, the first-hand perspective of autistic children. In four case studies, we demonstrate how this approach allowed us to develop unique individual and structural insights into the experiences of autistic children with technology.

                            1. Patients with Parkinson's disease often experience freezing of gait, which bears a high risk of falling, a prevalent cause for morbidity and mortality. In this work we present GaitAssist, a wearable system for freezing of gait support in daily life. The system provides real-time auditory cueing after the onset of freezing episodes. Furthermore, GaitAssist implements training exercises to learn how to handle freezing situations. GaitAssist is the result of a design process where we considered the input of engineers, clinicians and 18 Parkinson's disease patients, in order to find an optimal trade-off between system wearability and performance. We tested the final system in a user study with 5 additional patients. They reported a reduction in the freezing of gait duration as a result of the auditory stimulation provided, and that they feel the system enhanced their confidence during walking.

                            1. Efforts to address the problems of literacy are often focused on developing countries. However, functional illiteracy is a challenge encountered by up to 50% of adults in developed countries. In this paper we reflect on the challenges we faced in trying to design and study the use of a mobile application to support adult literacy with two user groups: adults enrolled in literacy classes and carpenters without a high school education enrolled in an essential skills program. We also elaborate on aspects of the evaluations that are specific to a marginalized, functionally illiterate, group in a developed country - aspects that are less frequently present in similar studies of mobile literacy support technologies in developing countries. We conclude with presenting the lessons learnt from our evaluations and the impact of the studies' specific challenges on the outcome and uptake of such mobile assistive technologies in providing practical support to low-literacy adults in conjunction with literacy and essential skills training.

                            1. This paper presents the outcomes of an exploratory field study that examined the social impact of an ICT-based suite of exergames for people with dementia and their caregivers. Qualitative data was collected over a period of 8 months, during which time we studied the daily life of 14 people with dementia and their informal and professional caregivers. We focus on the experiential aspects of the system and examine its social impact when integrated into the daily routines of both people with dementia themselves and their professional and family caregivers. Our findings indicate that relatives were able to regain leisure time, whilst people with dementia were able to recapture certain aspects of their social and daily activities that might otherwise have been lost to them. Results suggest that the system enhanced social-interaction, invigorated relationships, and improved the empowerment of people with dementia and their caregivers to face daily challenges.

                            1. Deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) individuals encounter difficulties when engaged in group conversations with hearing individuals, due to factors such as simultaneous utterances from multiple speakers and speakers whom may be potentially out of view. We interviewed and co-designed with eight DHH participants to address the following challenges: 1) associating utterances with speakers, 2) ordering utterances from different speakers, 3) displaying optimal content length, and 4) visualizing utterances from out-of-view speakers. We evaluated multiple designs for each of the four challenges through a user study with twelve DHH participants. Our study results showed that participants significantly preferred speechbubble visualizations over traditional captions. These design preferences guided our development of SpeechBubbles, a real-time speech recognition interface prototype on an augmented reality head-mounted display. From our evaluations, we further demonstrated that DHH participants preferred our prototype over traditional captions for group conversations.

                            1. Despite widespread interest in civic technologies, empowering neighbourhoods to take advantage of these technologies in their local area remains challenging. This paper presents findings from the Ardler Inventors project, which aimed to understand how neighbourhoods can be supported in performing roles normally carried out by researchers and designers. We describe the end-to-end process of bringing people together around technology, designing and prototyping ideas, and ultimately testing several devices in their local area. Through this work, we explore different strategies for infrastructuring local residents' participation with technology, including the use of hackathon-like intensive design events and pre-designed kits for assembly. We contribute findings relating to the ability of these strategies to support building communities around civic technology and the challenges that must be addressed.

In this paper, we discuss children's and teachers' experiences in a small rural town in Uruguay where every child in elementary school has received a laptop from the OLPC Foundation. In conducting activities in classrooms, observing children, and speaking with their teachers we found that the laptops have had a positive impact so far, with children accessing information resources that were previously unavailable, creating content for the world to see, collaborating and learning from each other, and increasing their interest in reading and writing. We also noted several challenges that need to be addressed, some directly related to human-computer interaction including problems with input devices, basic interactions, and the conceptual design and localization of user interfaces.

                            1. For many people living with conditions such as autism, anxiety manifests so powerfully it has a big impact on quality of life. By investigating the suitability of truly customizable wearable health devices we build on prior research that found each experience of anxiety in people with autism is unique, so 'one-suits all' solutions are not suitable. In addition, users desire agency and control in all aspects of the system. The participative approach we take is to iteratively co-develop prototypes with end users. Here we describe a case study of the co-development of one prototype, a digital stretch wristband that records interaction for later reflection called Snap. Snap has been designed to sit within a platform that allows the distributed and sustainable design, manufacture and data analysis of customizable digital health technologies. We contribute to HCI with (1) lessons learned from a DIY co-development process that follows the principles of modularity, participation and iteration and (2) the potential impact of technology in self-management of anxiety and the broader design implications of addressing unique anxiety experiences.

                            1. Expressing one's thoughts and feelings is a fundamental human need - the basis for communication and social interaction. We ask, how do minimally-verbal children on the autism spectrum express themselves? How can we better recognise instances of self-expression? And how might technologies support and encourage self-expression? To address these questions, we undertook co-design research at an autism-specific primary school with 20 children over one school year. This paper contributes six Modalities of Self-Expression, through which children self-express and convey their design insights. Each modality of self-expression can occur across two different dimensions (socio-expressive and auto-expressive) and can be of a fundamental or an integrative nature. Further, we contribute the design trajectory of a tangible ball prototype, the ExpressiBall, which - through voice, sounds, lights, and motion sensors - explores how tangible technologies can support this range of expressive modalities. Finally, we discuss the concept of Self-Expression by Design.

                            1. This paper presents co-design fiction as an approach to engaging users in imagining, envisioning and speculating not just on future technology but future life through co-created fictional works. Design fiction in research is often created or written by researchers. There is relatively little critical discussion of how to co-create design fictions with end-users, with the concomitant opportunities and challenges this poses. To fill this gap in knowledge, we conducted co-design fiction workshops with nine older creative writers, utilising prompts to inspire discussion and engage their imaginative writing about the trend towards tracking and monitoring older people. Their stories revealed futures of neither dystopia nor utopia but of social and moral dilemmas narrating their wish not just to "maintain their independence", but a palpable desire for adventure and very nuanced senses of how they wish to take control. We discuss inherent tensions in the control of the co-design fiction process; balancing the author's need for freedom and creativity with the researcher's desire to guide the process toward the design investigation at hand.

The research addresses both the practical considerations about how to structure hands-on making workshops in a way which is accessible to participants of varying experience and abilities, and how effective the approach was in enabling participants to tell their own stories and feel in control of the design and making process. The results of our analysis is the offering of insights in how to run e-textile making sessions in such a way for them to be more accessible and inclusive to a wider community of participants.

                            1. Despite indications that recreational virtual reality (VR) experiences could be beneficial for people with dementia, this area remains unexplored in contrast to the body of work on neurological rehabilitation through VR in dementia. With recreational VR applications coming to the market for dementia, we must consider how VR experiences for people with dementia can be sensitively designed to provide comfortable and enriching experiences. Working with seven participants from a local dementia care charity, we outline some of the opportunities and challenges inherent to the design and use of VR experiences with people with dementia and their carers through an inductive thematic analysis. We also provide a series of future directions for work in VR and dementia: 1) careful physical design, 2) making room for sharing, 3) utilizing all senses, 4) personalization, and 5) ensuring the active inclusion of the person with dementia.

                            1. An increasing number of pervasive healthcare systems are being designed, that allow people to monitor and get feedback on their health and wellness. To address the challenges of self-management of mental illnesses, we have developed the MONARCA system - a personal monitoring system for bipolar patients. We conducted a 14 week field trial in which 12 patients used the system, and we report findings focusing on their experiences. The results were positive; compared to using paper-based forms, the adherence to self-assessment improved; the system was considered very easy to use; and the perceived usefulness of the system was high. Based on this study, the paper discusses three HCI questions related to the design of personal health technologies; how to design for disease awareness and self-treatment, how to ensure adherence to personal health technologies, and the roles of different types of technology platforms.

                            1. Adolescents with chronic conditions must work with family caregivers to manage their illness experiences. To explore how technology can support collaborative documentation of these experiences, we designed and distributed a paper diary probe kit in a two-week field deployment with 12 adolescent-parent dyads (24 participants). Three insights emerged from the study that highlight how technology can support shared illness management: 1) provide scaffolds to recognize physical and emotional experiences in the context of daily activities; 2) help families reconstruct patient experiences; and 3) adapt to individual preferences for capturing, representing and sharing experiences. We discuss opportunities for HCI research that follow from these findings and conclude by reflecting on the benefits and limitations of using diary probes with adolescent patients and their parental caregivers.

                            1. As research increasingly turns to work 'in the wild' to design and evaluate technologies under real-world conditions, little consideration has been given to what happens when research ends. In many cases, users are heavily involved in the design process and encouraged to integrate the resulting technologies into their lives before they are withdrawn, while in some cases technologies are being left in place after research concludes. Often, little is done to assess the impact and legacy of these deployments. In this paper, we return to two examples in which we designed technologies with the involvement of communities and examine what steps were taken to ensure their long-term viability and what happened following the departure of researchers. From these examples, we provide guidelines for planning and executing technology handovers when conducting research with communities.

                            1. There has been a dramatic growth in interactive technology use by children under the age of 5 during the past decade. Despite this growth, children under the age of 5 typically participate only as users or testers in the design process in the overwhelming majority of projects targeting this population presented in key child-computer interaction venues. In this paper we introduce play-based design, an age-appropriate design method to give 3-4-year-old children a voice in the design process. More specifically, we contribute a thorough analysis of the use of existing methods to design technologies for children under the age of 5, a summary of the process that resulted in the development of play-based design, a detailed description of play-based design, a qualitative analysis of our experience implementing play-based design with two groups of children, and a discussion of play-based design's place among other methods, its advantages, and limitations.

                            1. Research suggests that parental engagement through Joint Media Engagement (JME) is an important factor in children's learning for coding and programming. Unfortunately, parents with limited technology background may have difficulty supporting their children's access to programming. English-language learning (ELL) families from marginalized communities face particular challenges in understanding and supporting programming, as code is primarily authored using English text. We present BlockStudio, a programming tool for empowering ELL families to jointly engage in introductory coding, using an environment embodying two design principles, text-free and visually concrete. We share a case study involving three community centers serving immigrant and refugee populations. Our findings show ELL families can jointly engage in programming without text, via co-creation and flexible roles, and can create a range of artifacts, indicating understanding of aspects of programming within this environment. We conclude with implications for coding together in ELL families and design ideas for text-free programming research.

                            1. To successfully function within a team, students must develop a range of skills for communication, organization, and conflict resolution. For students on the autism spectrum, these skills mirror the social, communicative, and cognitive experiences that can often be challenging for these learners. Since instructors and students collaborate using a mix of technology, we investigated the technology needs of neurodiverse teams comprised of autistic and non-autistic students. We interviewed seven autistic students and five employees of disability services in higher education. Our analysis focused on technology stakeholder values, stages of small-group development, and Social Translucence – a model for online collaboration highlighting principles of visibility, awareness, and accountability. Despite motivation to succeed, neurodiverse students have difficulty expressing individual differences and addressing team conflict. To support future design of technology for neurodiverse teams, we propose: (1) a design space and design concepts including collaborative and affective computing tools, and (2) extending Social Translucence to account for student and group identities.

                            1. Design research processes often take place in publicly funded projects. Besides designers and users, public funding increasingly requires industry partners to participate in such projects. We present empirical insights from a joint research project in order to assess the claims connected with such funding structures and to report on challenges for design research within them. We identify three themes of conflict between academic and industry partners and elaborate on the sources of them. The presentation of our results builds on the distinction between 'academia' and 'industry', which is frequently applied by political funding agencies. The analysis of the respective stakeholders' actual interests, however, will prove such a dichotomy to be misleading and simplistic.

                            1. This paper provides a critical examination of how digital systems within a charitable organisation in the North of England are being used to both support and challenge male perpetrators of domestic violence. While there exists a range of digital tools to support the victim-survivors of domestic violence, no tools are available to challenge the abusive and harmful behaviours of perpetrators. Through this work, we uncovered the compelling moral responsibilities intrinsic within interactions with technological systems between perpetrators and support workers. As such, we highlight four spaces of negotiation concerning a person's responsibility in changing their abusive behaviour, which we have coined as mechanisms to represent their fundamental and interconnected nature. These mechanisms include self-awareness, acknowledging the extent of harms, providing peer support and respecting authorities. These insights are the basis for offering some practical considerations for HCI scholars, policymakers and intervention designers in their work with perpetrators of violence.

                            1. While user participation is central to HCI, co-inquiry takes this further by having participants direct and control research from conceptualisation to completion. We describe a co-inquiry, conducted over 16 months with a Parkinson's support group. We explored how the participation of members might be enabled across multiple stages of a research project, from the generation of research questions to the development of a prototype. Participants directed the research into developing alternative modes of information provision, resulting in 'Parkinson's Radio' – a collectivist health information service produced and edited by members of the support group. We reflect on how we supported participation at different stages of the project and the successes and challenges faced by the team. We contribute insights into the design of collectivist health technologies for this group, and discuss opportunities and tensions for conducting co-inquiry in HCI research.

                            1. The development of platforms for community decision-making has been of growing interest to the HCI community, yet the ways technology might be woven into traditional consultation processes has been under-studied. We conducted fieldwork at consultation events where residents were invited to discuss and map assets related to their neighbourhoods to inform community decision-making. The fieldwork highlighted problems with equality, turn taking, the evidencing and elaborating on opinions by residents, and challenges related to capturing and documenting the events. We developed Community Conversational-a hybrid table-top game and digital capture and review platform-in response to these issues. Community Conversational was designed to provide a flexible structure to consultation events related to 'place', and support the production, capture and review of deliberative 'talk' to support decision-making. We study how the platform was used in two consultation events, and discuss the implications of capturing and evidencing local people's opinions for the accountability of decision-makers and community organisations.

                            1. Parents use mobile monitoring software to observe and restrict their children's activities in order to minimize the risks associated with Internet-enabled mobile devices. As children are stakeholders in such technologies, recent research has called for their inclusion in its design process. To investigate children's perceptions of parental mobile monitoring technologies and explore their interaction preferences, we held two co-design sessions with 12 children ages 7-12. Children first reviewed and redesigned an existing mobile monitoring application. Next, they designed ways children could use monitoring software when they encounter mobile risks (e.g., cyberbullying, inappropriate content). Results showed that children acknowledged safety needs and accepted certain parental controls. They preferred and designed controls that emphasized restriction over monitoring, taught risk coping, promoted parent-child communication, and automated interactions. Our results benefit designers looking to develop parental mobile monitoring technologies in ways that children will both accept and can actively benefit from.

                            1. We examined the integration of VR into informal and less-structured learning environments in Atlanta (USA) and Mumbai (India) through a process of co-design, co-creation, and co-learning with students and teachers where students learned to use VR to engage with their economic, social, and cultural realities. Using qualitative methods, we engaged students and teachers at both sites in VR content creation activities; through these activities, we attempt to uncover a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities of introducing low-cost mobile VR for content generation, consumption, and sharing in underserved learning contexts. We also motivate future work that looks at integrating VR in new contexts, using flexible methods, across borders. The larger vision of our research is to advance us towards greater accessibility and inclusivity of VR across diverse learning environments.

                            1. This paper investigates connecting people in remote communities through nature in order to foster stewardship and conservation of endangered species. Global citizen science technologies have found success in urban, developed countries, but they typically rely on large distributed populations to gather or analyze data and do not suit sparsely populated and remote contexts. We undertook a long-term field study to iteratively co-design a tangible and playful nature engagement prototype in a remote World Heritage Area community. The prototype design fosters learning through ambient sounds as well as exploration and discovery of species through nature soundscape recordings. We found that the prototypes amplified locals' interest, became embedded in community relations and gradually led to placemaking of new engagement 'spaces' and of newer forms. We contribute lessons learned on how design can foster nature engagement and stewardship of endangered species by heeding Suchman's call for design to "enter networks of relations that make technology possible". We contribute design implications and new design foci HCI/Citizen science engagement for species conservation.

                            1. Social communication frequently includes nuanced nonverbal communication cues, including eye contact, gestures, facial expressions, body language, and tone of voice. This type of communication is central to face-to-face interaction, but can be challenging for children and adults with autism. Innovative technologies can provide support by augmenting human-delivered cuing and automated prompting. Specifically, immersive virtual reality (VR) offers an option to generalize social skill interventions by concretizing nonverbal information in real-time social interactions. In this work, we explore the design and evaluation of three nonverbal communication applications in immersive VR. The results of this work indicate that delivering real-time visualizations of proximity, speaker volume, and duration of one's speech is feasible in immersive VR and effective for real-time support for proximity regulation for children with autism. We conclude with design considerations for therapeutic VR systems.

                            1. Designing new technologies to support the lived experience of dementia is of increasing interest within HCI. While there is guidance on qualitative research methods to use in areas such as dementia, there is a need for more appropriate ways to research in the younger demographic. In Younger Onset Dementia (YOD), the circumstances and experiences are markedly different from dementia in the later stage of life requiring a different approach. This paper presents insights into the methods and approaches used in fieldwork with five people living with YOD; where they engaged as co-researchers in a co-directed inquiry into their lived experiences. Through this, we make a number of methodological contributions to HCI and Participatory Action Research (PAR) for research in the YOD setting. This includes productive approaches that are sensitive, respectful and empowering to the participants. It also extends current approaches to using probes in HCI and dementia research.

    - Authors' sense of levels of equality in an intergenerational design team

        - My ordering from low to high

            - [[Informant Design]], per [[@scaifeDesigningDesigningInformant1997]]: context of educational software, and focuses on adapting [[Participatory Design]] for the reality that children will never reach full equality with adults in the same session (inherent power dynamics, and also limitations of time, knowledge, and expertise)

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FobJJjnkIgA.png?alt=media&token=baa3d649-02db-4141-82f7-fbe669b5661d)

                - I think that Scaife is essentially saying that [[[[CL]] - Some populations of users intrinsically cannot be equal partners in a design process]]

            - [[Bonded Design]] (this paper): "bonding" people with unequal power and different expertise in pursuit of a common task throughout the design process, in a way that retains their individual strengths *and* weaknesses

                - Difference from [[Informant Design]] is in the when: [[@scaifeDesigningDesigningInformant1997]] focus on just the "motivational/fun" aspects, whereas here they do it all, and throughout the design process

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FxDpKOZ7cmZ.png?alt=media&token=7a213e3a-ff6c-4501-8bf2-1abc167ec40f)![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F47qc_wBNQs.png?alt=media&token=dacdaa9a-cea6-4a76-afab-a96dda0637d5) (p. 79-80)

            - [[Cooperative Inquiry]], per [[@druinCooperativeInquiryDeveloping1999]]: expansive! children are full design partners. KidPad is proof-of-concept of the value of the approach (more flexible and creative than they would have suspected with children only as user and tester)

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F8Lp_xyxb9u.png?alt=media&token=dd178722-f3bb-490d-8e00-5edf0ef9a346) (p. 67-68)

            - [[User-centered Design]]: users are involved after technology has been designed to give feedback, can reveal design shortcomings, but can't initiate changes

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FO0qm9NKQmN.png?alt=media&token=5c8b6140-c79d-4f19-b2c2-f00777f22a39) (p. 66)

            - [[Contextual Design]] (e.g., [[Karen Holtzblatt]]): users are involved before technology has been designed, typically in their own contexts, but primarily as "data" (about the details and motivations behind their work), and help to test lo-fi early prototypes (such as [[Paper Prototyping]]), but do not directly do design or initiate changes

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FwWGui9yx41.png?alt=media&token=0690434b-2ac8-4889-bc8e-d03f9881eb8c) (p. 66)

        - Also mentioned, but I'm having trouble placing them, seem like... different things.

            - [[Learned-centered Design]]: seems like a specific instantiation of [[User-centered Design]] for learning sciences?

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FFeZ18f5rBg.png?alt=media&token=e73c1886-d97f-45b3-bfff-d795972f68b8)

            - [[Participatory Design]]: again, seems like a much higher-level construct, like a philosophy or stance, rather than a specific methodology... idk

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FRuSWgiVZnB.png?alt=media&token=6c92490e-abd4-44f9-8461-9bb5547bee32) (p. 67)

                - Cites [[@carmelPDJointApplication1993]] as description, which includes comparisons between North American and Scandinavian traditions

                    - Note that this paper is in LIS, not [[HCI]]

        - Author's ordering in Figure 1:

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FFmSB89yFsP.png?alt=media&token=761aa3be-aa90-4c16-a8c0-7cbba84a6b92) (p. 79)

            - Weird: on p67 they say that ID is between UCD and PD

    - Questions:

        - How can we think about dimensions of involvement in a more granular way?

            - Equality

            - **When** in the design process?

                - Typically after initial prototype design, feedback used to inform final concept

            - **What** is the nature of users' input?

        - What is a "useful" level of granularity for us? Clearly the different "things" can intermix in a single PD effort! What makes something CD instead of PD? What's the analog to, say, the distinction between method, methodology, and epistemology in research methods (see, e.g., crotty)?

    - Observations #[[➰ breadcrumbs]] turn into evidence notes

        - Low response rate from Grade 3 not for lack of interest but due to clashes with sports activities that were scheduled

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FxWXz8Bbq3P.png?alt=media&token=f4e74aa7-ed40-4cc9-9104-fdf8941dfea8) (p. 69)

            - This reminds me very much of [[[[EVD]] - Children from underserved communities were often unable to attend in-lab PD sessions due to travel and time constraints - [[@walshEquityEqualityAmerican2018]]]], which literally had the same thing about extracurricular sports.

        - [[[[EVD]] - in design sessions with children, there were tensions between interpretation of the participant voice v. the stakeholder [[@frauenbergerInterpretingInputChildren2012b]]]]

            - need to build rapport to help with the tension

                - good label for this is stakeholders - recognizing the multiple, potentially competing stakeholders that might overwrite the voice of the "primary stakeholders"

            - tension again with level of interpretation and faithfulness

                - > "We identified a key challenge in **faithfully representing input from participants while appreciating the value in our own experiences**. While in other contexts, the contribution of participants is more tangible, as they are directly co-designing the output, **the given context did not allow for this immediacy, and it fell to the designers to ensure that the input from our participants was upheld and shaped the outcome**. However, this **mediation or interpretation of input is prone to be unduly biased by the expectations and goals of the designers**. To mitigate this effect, we have developed a methodical approach to mindful interpretation that is grounded in the philosophical perspective of phenomenology." p. 2384 (Discussion)

        - This highlights three areas of interest for our survey/review

            - **Third** and finally, we're very interested in the top right region (^^**innovations that resolve tensions/tradeoffs between depth and breadth**^^)

                - Examples:

                    - [[@walshDisCoCodesignOnline2012]]'s tool for remote PD, which enables geographical barriers (see also later work on moving PD to the library, or developing chatbot/AI scaffolds to reduce the designer requirements)

                        - > IDEAS (Interface Design Experience for the Autistic Spectrum) is a method for involving children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) in the technology design process. This paper extends the IDEAS method to enable use with a design team, providing specific added support for communication and collaboration difficulties that may arise. A study to trial this extended method was conducted with two design teams, each involving three children with ASD, in a series of six, weekly design sessions focused on designing a math game. The findings from this study reveal that the children were able to successfully participate in the sessions and collaborate with other children. The findings also highlight the positive experience that involvement in such a process can offer this population.

                    - Co-Design Beyond Words | Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300251

                        - > Existing co-design methods support verbal children on the autism spectrum in the design process, while their minimally-verbal peers are overlooked. We describe Co-Design Beyond Words (CDBW), an approach which merges existing co-design methods with practice-based methods from Speech and Language Therapy which are child-led and interests-based. These emphasise the rich detail that can be conveyed in the moment, through recognising occurrences of, for example, Joint Attention, Turn Taking and Imitation. We worked in an autism-specific primary school over 20 weeks with ten children, aged 5 to 8. We co-designed a playful prototype, the TangiBall, using the three iterative phases of CDBW; the Foundation Phase (preparation for interaction), the Interaction Phase (designing-and-reflecting in the moment) and the Reflection Phase (reflection-on-action). We contribute a novel co-design approach and present moments of interaction, the micro instances in design in which minimally-verbal children on the spectrum can convey meaning beyond words, through their actions, interactions, and attentional foci. These moments of interaction provide design insight, shape design direction, and reveal unique strengths, interests, and abilities.

                    - [take-home](((nEFB1ngAW))) journal and camera [activity](((qJ9dT-GxC))) helped to move [older adults](((xDXm4o9PP))) [away from stereotypes](((EDc9EWvey))) of their own needs (expressed in the first session before the take-home activity) to expressing and co-designing for their real needs (in the second session after the take-home activity). [Examples of](((aWH59NkS9))) "stereotypical" needs included a strong focus on health and medical reminders in the first session; in contrast, examples of more diverse needs included a smart bulleting board for monitoring utility usage, exercise prompters, and communication devices. [[@pradhanUnderstandingOlderAdults2020]]

                - We're interested in enumerating "innovations" that make PD more inclusive: __what are known variants or modifications of PD that have more desirable inclusivity properties while retaining high levels of "true" participation?__

                    - We might need to do a second pass on this after completing the first pass, since there might be innovations like distributed PD that are not necessarily explicitly/directly/narrowly aimed at increasing inclusivity, but might tackle one or more of the key barriers to inclusion for existing methods. We'll be sensitized to these list of factors and can then circle back with fresh searches for methods that target these factors if we want

            - **Second**, we're interested in the top-middle/left region (^^**compromising depth to achieve breadth**^^).

                - We're interested in synthesizing statements/findings of the form: __"we felt we had to do X to include more diverse users, but this led to problems with Y aspect of empowering users to be co-designers"__

                    - Note: It's possible these tradeoffs/compromises (both this and the previous one) may be latent.

                        - Do we need to take a critical lens to analyze existing techniques?

                            - My instinct is to scope this out for later work. It may become an easier task after we complete this scoped review

                            - That seems like.... a different and harder task.

                - Examples:

                    - Design team moved sessions on site to increase diversity, but they weren't able to do th kind of rapport building they felt was necessary for true co-design due to constraints of [time constraints](The sessions were conducted on site which presented challenges for researchers in regards to time. They were not able to be develop the same relationships with [participants](((afXu8XPz-))). ) and the [barrier of setting up the space from scratch each time](((WAphbr1-O))) [[@foss2013cooperative]]

                    - Changed design sessions to month-long projects instead of year-long projects [on a compressed timeline](Design sessions were changed from year long projects to [month long projects](((lVW0KB9hI))) and focused on one design problem rather that multiple problems) [[@walshEquityEqualityAmerican2018]]

            - **First**, we're interested in the bottom right region (^^**(inadvertently) sacrificing breadth for depth of participation**^^), where frameworks and practices/techniques for PD end up being barriers to inclusion (whether intentionally or not).

                - We're interested in synthesizing statements/findings of the form: __"we felt we had to do X to really help the users become empowered co-designers, BUT we found that this put up Y barrier to inclusion"__

of the properties of PD methods/techniques, particularly in terms of techniques that have specific requirements for the types of users who can participate (e.g., prior design experience, need for accommodation).

                    - it really helps to have users come into the lab (to do [[Cooperative Inquiry]]), but this is [hard/impossible for many children from underserved communities due to travel and time constraints](issues with [travel and time](((1wrkXgkS4))) constraints kept [children](((jKDV9geaV))) from underserved communities and who attended after school activities from attending lab sessions in the first 3 years.) [[@walshEquityEqualityAmerican2018]]

    - Second, the sources we're reviewing. I think the [initial collection of papers]([[agile/Tasks and subtasks]]) we tackled was not ideal. We need to do a more systematic collection, and also more clearly define the scope

        - Inclusion / exclusion criteria: --> **Exclusion criteria**: (persistent)

            - Include: Proposed techniques that target PD inclusivity improvements __with empirical evaluation data__

            - Include: Direct case / observations of PD with "nontraditional" users

                - "direct observations" --> not synthesized reflections that are hard to trace back to instances

                - "nontraditional" ~= age (very young, very old), SES, race, ability, sexual orientation...

                    - what else?

                    - one argument would be to scope it down

                    - but there might be keen insights to be gained from taking a broader lens:

                        - where might barriers to inclusion be concentrated, taking an intersectional lens to this?

    - added observation notes for issues [obtaining consent from children with no adult support]([Issues with obtaining consent](((Qhehb1K9b))) from [children](((slZCVGK1p))) presented a challenge being that there were no parents at the libraries with the children. The IRB met and came to the conclusion that being that no harm could come to the children consent wouldn't be required but that a consent form would be sent home with the children.)

    - added observation notes for [solutions to designing with no outside design partner](A [librarian](((fmsxRJp3s))) suggested the design process focus on the [children's safety and security](((nEiFDxKz9))). This level of respect for them allowed the [children](((slZCVGK1p))) to devise prototypes which were relevant to their community and aided in the engagement of the children.)

                - shorter (weeks vs. a year +), ad-hoc design teams (vs. [[Cooperative Inquiry]])

- in general, can draw from paper snippets from our reading list for [[[[QUE]] - What tension points exist between the goals of diversity and depth of user participation in participatory design?]]. the good papers will have concrete figures that help get a concrete sense of what PD is like

    - concept of intermediaries ("human access points, champions, or gatekeepers") again as necessary for [[Participatory Design]] with rural users

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FTLWa1mMXJE.png?alt=media&token=84d28058-3723-4404-b57e-c804c00786a8)![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FEsi0HGPdJa.png?alt=media&token=a835cb85-492f-41f1-b7b9-0e0efdb5e645) (p. 92-93)

    - NGOs and gov institutions may be necessary, for sustainability reasons: some users may lack power and resources to sustain solution, so those with power and resources need to be involved somehow. this can get complicated, i imagine!

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FiD6bk-FPtQ.png?alt=media&token=d3550d3c-e4ae-4c71-a4b3-a7eed2e965a1)

    - methods notes

        - initial intermediary was a community learning facilitator from an international NGO that had previously funded projects in the communities. the NGO had to leave bc their funding ended and they couldn't secure more funding. next intermediary was a water officer from local government.

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FmNbghS-TsH.png?alt=media&token=d2a2af74-d6f1-4abc-bd2f-dad19790e972) (p. 93)

        - setting here: ~60 participants across stakeholder groups for problem of rural water management in Uganda, over the course of roughly a year.

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2Fo4rO6Lq2v7.png?alt=media&token=fa3428fb-2536-4616-ae28-64eb7bcab22f) (p. 93)

        - project involved situational analysis, first workshop (initial needfinding), second workshop (collaborative design, with reflections and outputs and high-fidelity prototype), third workshop (with initial prototype + training), formative evaluation after using prototype for 6 months (through semi-structured interviews with individual users) and fourth workshop (clarifying feedback from deploy). workshops varied from 2-3 days of ~6 hrs each.

    - so what can we take from this?

        - the most interesting piece for me is the observation about intermediaries who "spoke for the users" in section 4.2: "on a government official as intermediary": [[[[EVD]] - Intermediaries such as local government officials were necessary for accessing and co-designing with marginalized populations, but the intermediaries sometimes spoke for the people in ways that opposed what they really wanted - [[@ssozi-mugaruraSupportingCommunityNeeds2016]]]]

            - this connects with our discussions of the tensions and tradeoffs around "[extra stakeholders]([[[[CLM]] - Marginalized user populations may require involvement of extra stakeholders who may complicate hearing the users' voices]])"

        - secondarily, there was a reflection on the need for more high-fidelity prototypes __in situ__ for meaningful design feedback to emerge, which required some creative re-rigging of the prototypes (local-first, offline data capture, etc.): [[[[EVD]] - In-situ prototypes were needed to enable genuine design input from local marginalized users, which required creative adaptations to the prototypes - [[@ssozi-mugaruraSupportingCommunityNeeds2016]]]]

            - this connects with our discussions of the tensions and tradeoffs around space, and possibly also design compromises due to limitations of the users (e.g., [physical prototypes for users with dementia]([[[[EVD]] - physical prototypes were necessary to prompt aid discussion with codesigners with dementia, but also led to fixation on unfinished aspects of the design - [[@lindsayEmpathyParticipatoryDesign2012b]]]]), or [concrete exemplars with 3rd-graders]([[[[EVD]] - Designers experienced issues with (and had to compromise) design activities, such as analogies and giving concrete examplers, with 3rd-graders due to cognitive and difficulties with focus and abstract ideas - [[@largeBondedDesignNovel2006]]]]))

    - One thing that is surprising is that this paper doesn't cite [[@walshEquityEqualityAmerican2018]], even though they have very similar research questions.

    - [[Joel Chan]] and [[AJ Rudd Jr]] read this paper awhile ago (roughly in February of [[Spring 2021]]) and extracted 6 key observations that inform our question (we're just now converting to the new format):

        - [[[[EVD]] - Low-income, African-American older adults perceived ideation materials used for brainstorming as infantilizing and belittling - [[@harringtonDeconstructingCommunityBasedCollaborative2019]]]]

- Ok let's prototype this then for [[[[QUE]] - What tension points exist between the goals of diversity and depth of user participation in participatory design?]]

    - Move all existing working notes here

        - Conjecture: Some of these tension points might be irreconcilable (we must pick); others might be navigable and resolvable. It would be interesting and useful to sort out the differences, and make sure we're not prematurely closing ourselves off to opportunities

            - The concept of [[design tensions]] might be a useful analytical tool for sorting these out, which are actually under the potential agency of a design team [[@tatarDesignTensionsFramework2007]]

                - [[@harringtonDeconstructingCommunityBasedCollaborative2019]] actually build directly on this analytical framework to identify tensions along the way towards making more equitable [[Participatory Design]] approaches for engaging with vulnerable populations

                - [participants](((GJbq15tlq))) expressed [doubts](((SL1fARaYL))) about the usefulness of technological solutions for their communities due to past experiences with policies and laws perpetuating inequity

            - A similar theme comes from [[@walshEquityEqualityAmerican2018]], who reported that A [librarian](((fmsxRJp3s))) suggested the design process focus on the [children's safety and security](((nEiFDxKz9))).

    - the design team also perceived possible tensions around how to navigate **power dynamics** and multiple competing values/goals from the main user population vs. the organizations that served them and provided access to them

        - for example, they worried that

    - [[Salma Elsayed-Ali]] read this paper awhile back (roughly March of [[Spring 2020]]). [[AJ Rudd Jr]] then did another pass in March of [[Spring 2021]]

    - This paper is a bit tough for our review, because... it's more of a set of reflections and claims on experience, then a set of concrete observations. So they're not really... evidence in a strict sense??

    - There's a TON Of value in this paper describing the elements of [[Cooperative Inquiry]] as a flavor of [[Participatory Design]] aimed at intergenerational design teams.

    - There are some reflections that might be worth integrating into discussion of this paper, but not used as evidence per se.. not at least until we figure out how to think about these reflections as evidence.

        - [field specific challenges](((yV5kS73s6)))(Educators, Computer Science) should be considered because they can lead to communication issues with children.

            - but also very very reminiscent of what we saw with harrington:

                - [[[[EVD]] - Black and LatinX codesign participants distrusted researchers from the local university due to perceived abandonment after past research studies - [[@harringtonDeconstructingCommunityBasedCollaborative2019]]]]

            - and also ssozi: [[[[EVD]] - Intermediaries such as local government officials were necessary for accessing and co-designing with marginalized populations, but the intermediaries sometimes spoke for the people in ways that opposed what they really wanted - [[@ssozi-mugaruraSupportingCommunityNeeds2016]]]]

        - [[[[EVD]] - Aboriginal informants expressed deep skepticism of "evidence-based" top-down models and perceived them as conflicting with more effective local knowledge - [[@butcherCommunityEngagementYouth2020]]]]

    - # discussion

        - these findings and themes are not directly from experiences doing [[Participatory Design]], but like [[@ereteEmpoweredParticipationHow2017]], they inform understanding of how to deeply engage with marginalized communities.

        - the themes of [extra stakeholders]([[[[CLM]] - Marginalized user populations may require involvement of extra stakeholders who may complicate hearing the users' voices]]) and [layers of interpretation]([[[[CLM]] - There is a tension between analyzing participants' direct inputs, and respecting their actual insights (vs. designers' interpretation) that is intensified when working with design partners who struggle to contribute more directly to design artifacts]]) seemed to show up again, with the latter having a more nuanced idea of ways of clashes in ways of knowing

        - themes of history and distrust also showed up again, reminiscent of [[@harringtonEngagingLowincomeAfrican2019a]], likely to show up with any marginalized community with long, deep histories of oppression and exploitation by communities connected to power (which often includes researchers and designers)

    - results notes

        - something here about bottleneck - [[[[EVD]] - success of one mixed-race community at influencing policy through ICTs depended on a single appointed community leader to funnel concerns, and there were concerns over this being a bottleneck - [[@ereteEmpoweredParticipationHow2017]]]]

            - again reminds me of [[[[CL]] - There is a tension between analyzing participants' direct inputs, and respecting their actual insights (vs. designers' interpretation) that is intensified when working with design partners who struggle to contribute more directly to design artifacts]] and the stuff about stakeholders

        - positive effects of online participation (can diversify participation: maybe obvious, but still worth noting down!) [[[[EVD]] - online participation options for civic input diversified and strengthened participation in Chicago neighborhoods - [[@ereteEmpoweredParticipationHow2017]]]]

        - not sure if useful for our question, but this observation stood out: [[[[EVD]] - three communities across a range of race and income effectively used ICTs to engage with policy and governance, but government officials were most responsive to and proactive with the majority white / middle-high income community - [[@ereteEmpoweredParticipationHow2017]]]]

            - i think the flip side here is to note the equality in skill of engagement that pushes back against assumptions that they wouldn't be able to speak for themselves (e.g., [[[[CL]] - There is a tension between analyzing participants' direct inputs, and respecting their actual insights (vs. designers' interpretation) that is intensified when working with design partners who struggle to contribute more directly to design artifacts]])

                        - Couldn't make sense of how this relates to our core question?

                    - Adults are not children. They [communicate their needs](((Kw1ewavrb))) while adults communicate what they need as adults. Adults should not be used as proxies for children

                        - But the snippet includes something that could be useful: there seems to be a tension between the "operational" needs of the adult design partners (e.g., "classroom management"), and the participation needs of the child design partners. The authors believe this might be due to past experiences of working with children, possibly outside of a design setting.

    - "The overall approach to designing such a learning environment for a user population that has varying abilities was to **__evolve a participatory process that could include a range of children as design partners from early concept development through to prototyping and evaluation__**." p. 2378  Followed the process below.

    - **Foundation:** - building lasting relationships and initial observations;

        - [[**BUILDING RAPPORT**]]

        - "language games" to develop empathy and [[**BUILDING RAPPORT**]] p. 2384

    - **Inspire:** - creative design activities facilitating outside-the-box thinking,

    - **Listen:** - capturing and interpreting input and translating it into a design, and,

    - **Evaluate:** - testing design ideas with the participants.

    - **Focusing on the [Q: What tension points exist between the goals of diversity and depth of user participation in participatory design?]**

    - [[beth note]] I want to put these first two under [[**Logistics**]]

    - The team has to be "agile enough to respond to unpredictable issues as they arose, particularly as **__working with demanding school schedules necessitates pragmatic flexibility__**." p. 2378

    - Have to work within existing context constraints -- like a school or other formal education environment:

    - Had to set up meetings with teachers "to provide a meaningful context for participation and **__avoided placing unnecessary demands on teaching schedules__**"

    - **Role of the co-design participant **may influence the type of tension or challenge that the design team faces. Every role a child assumes in the "onion model" has inherent challenges:

    - > "Neither of these roles is without its problems. As testers, children have no direct means to of creatively contributing to the development, and are therefore restricted to giving feedback on artefacts that were created based on adult assumptions. At the other end of the scale, as full design partners children may be exposed to undue pressure to act as designers without possessing the necessary skills and intuition that most trained designers will have gained over many years of problem solving."

    - The tension between addressing the gap in perspective and context through participation, and the danger of building up undue expectations in terms of creative contribution to the design has troubled many design efforts in this field

    - **Content knowledge or 'ability' conundrum**: "__often there is a gap between the contributions from young design partners and the realities of designing a technological artefact, particularly when the children have special needs__"

    - cf the "conundrum" from the [[2013 CSCL paper]], where you are asking children who don't have content expertise to help co-design a technology or experience whose goal it is to teach the content expertise.

    - The context and abilities of co-designers/participants such as neurodiverse children results in more** indirect co-design/or design requirement articulation**. It requires some level of interpretation by designers.

    - > "We identified a key challenge in **faithfully representing input from participants while appreciating the value in our own experiences**. While in other contexts, the contribution of participants is more tangible, as they are directly co-designing the output, **the given context did not allow for this immediacy, and it fell to the designers to ensure that the input from our participants was upheld and shaped the outcome**. However, this **mediation or interpretation of input is prone to be unduly biased by the expectations and goals of the designers**. To mitigate this effect, we have developed a methodical approach to mindful interpretation that is grounded in the philosophical perspective of phenomenology." p. 2384 (Discussion)

    - > "Typically developing" children foregrounded different aspects of objects than neuro-diverse (ASC) children - Sensory Objects activity (p. 2379)

    - **Competing Requirements:** expandability and flexibility for play and social dev, but simple enough for use by a wide range of children

    - > "The project aims to evaluate the intervention created with respect to its impact on the social skills development of children. To facilitate such an evaluation, the design—as a research tool—had to be flexible and expandable to provide enough material for children to play with over several weeks. Furthermore, with the number of children being involved in such an evaluation, the design had to satisfy a wide range of preferences. On the other hand interaction had to be focused and simple enough to be able to collect data on a level that would allow meaningful analysis. It immediately becomes clear that all these forces do not necessarily pull the design in a single direction and it became a “wicked” problem. Neither the goals nor the expectations inherently linked to the different perspectives on developing ECHOES naturally converge." (p. )

    - What they did // **Method**

    - **What:** "Creative Workshop"

    - **Who:** Interdisciplinary team of researchers

    - **Goal:** To interpret the input of a year’s worth of PD work and converge the many disparate and complex requirements of ECHOES into a workable concept

    - **ECHOES:** To create a technologically enhanced learning environment to scaffold the social skill development of typically developing children and children with high functioning Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) or Aspergers Syndrome (AS).

    - Two Schools: one with 3 children with ASD; another with 30 typically developing children
