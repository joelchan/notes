    - i want to get a "map" of the area:

        - key scholars

            - repeating names:

                - o' neill

                - young

                - kramer (expclitly called out as foundational on p. 14)

                - ostrom (expliclty called out on p. 14)

        - key terms or fields

            - beneficiaries, not just clients

            - [[coproduction]]

            - value cocreation

        - key outlets

            - nonprofit and voluntary sector quarterly

            - nonprofit management and leadership

            - voluntas

        - some #[[➰ breadcrumbs]]

            - gift here in the section on beneficiaries as organizational actors (pp. 8-13)

                - whitaker 1976 - larger orgs less responsive to intended beneficiaries --> less lieky to encourage coproduction

                - new thread centered from 2000s in australia and europe

                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F0QYune5OWB.png?alt=media&token=9c5232e6-a04e-460a-b06f-da4844818428)

            - special issues in JVAR in the late 70's and 80's that apparently never gained traction

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FqfmBkNL8Xx.png?alt=media&token=727c7f2a-c2d6-408e-8469-1a2c46fc3877)

    - as well as the key results

        - analysis of mentions of beneficiaries in nonprofit journals between 1998-2018

            - also, [[[[EVD]] - in 3 major nonprofit research journals, between 1998-2018, only 5% of empirical studies mentioned beneficiaries in abstract, title or keyword; half of these included info about beneficiaries inside nonprofit, and only 5 explicitly discussed coproduction - [[@benjaminBringingBeneficiariesMore2020]]]] #Informs

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2Fq1JNTJ9tCA.png?alt=media&token=345bfa66-9b5d-40a3-a8e0-7359330d79fc)

        - analysis of mentions of beneficiaries in nonprofit management texts (short one on p. 13)

            - [[[[EVD]] - in 57 nonprofit management texts, beneficiaries were mentioned mostly in marketing and eval chapters, and infrequently in HR or volunteer management chapters - [[@benjaminBringingBeneficiariesMore2020]]]] #Informs

                - (implication; they are viewed as external stakeholders);

    - there's also a few key hypotheses about why clients are not more deeply integrated into service orgs

    - important contextual note here: [[coproduction]] overlaps with, but is not synynomous with [[Participatory Design]] in our sense

- Read [[@dodgeNonprofitsSchoolsDemocracy2016]] - not 100% directly relevant for [[[[QUE]] - What does it take for a nonprofit service organization to deeply involve clients in the design of service programs?]], because of differences in the type of org (these are more activist orgs with less power differential between org and "clients") and focus (here they are looking at what the nonprofit participants learn in terms of civics while doing the normal stuff they do with the nonprofit in terms of advocacy work). I suppose if anything, there is a sense that some structures from the broader world of nonprofits might transfer.

    - But still useful for training.

    - There are much more useful lit i found on [[sys/Elicit]], including several by [[Lehn M. Benjamin]]
