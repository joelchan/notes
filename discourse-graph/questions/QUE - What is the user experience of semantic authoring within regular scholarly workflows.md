    - Description

        - Different from studies of [[ontology engineers]] and other dedicated [[curator]]s, it is useful to also understand the extent to which semantic authoring can be integrated into the regular workflow of scholars.

        - Bunch of sub-questions here:

            - How does it feel for scholars to do semantic authoring themselves?

            - Where does semantic authoring fit or not in scholars' regular workflows?

            - How much would have to change in scholarly workflows for semantic authoring to fit?

            - has a user study that checks how easy it is to train 16 biomed researchers to convert a short text into a natural language statement (no [[formality]] though!)

        - [[@grozaSALTWeavingClaim2007]]

            - The 8 authors perceived the easier elements of SALT (like [[rhetorical blocks]] and marking that a text fragment is a claim) intuitive/easy, but struggled more with more complicated things like noting explicit relations between rhetorical elements, and including "domain knowledge" (I'm assuming this means some kind of formal ontology-like thing?) (p. 206, Fig. 7)

            - The 8 authors perceived the easier elements of SALT (like [[rhetorical blocks]] and marking that a text fragment is a claim) more certain to payoff, but struggled more with more complicated things like noting explicit relations between rhetorical elements, and including "domain knowledge" (p. 206, Fig. 8b)

        - [[WP: JCDL Where the semantic publishing rubber meets the scholarly practice road]] has some of our findings on this.
