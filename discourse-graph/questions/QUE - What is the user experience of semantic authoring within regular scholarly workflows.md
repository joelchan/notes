    - Description

        - Different from studies of [[ontology engineers]] and other dedicated [[curator]]s, it is useful to also understand the extent to which semantic authoring can be integrated into the regular workflow of scholars.

        - Bunch of sub-questions here:

            - How does it feel for scholars to do semantic authoring themselves?

            - Where does semantic authoring fit or not in scholars' regular workflows?

            - How much would have to change in scholarly workflows for semantic authoring to fit?

        - Related: [[[[QUE]] - What (existing) systems facilitate individual synthesis?]]

        - [[@kuhnBroadeningScopeNanopublications2013]]

            - has a user study that checks how easy it is to train 16 biomed researchers to convert a short text into a natural language statement (no [[formality]] though!)

        - [[@grozaSALTWeavingClaim2007]]

            - The 8 authors perceived the easier elements of SALT (like [[rhetorical blocks]] and marking that a text fragment is a claim) intuitive/easy, but struggled more with more complicated things like noting explicit relations between rhetorical elements, and including "domain knowledge" (I'm assuming this means some kind of formal ontology-like thing?) (p. 206, Fig. 7)

            - The 8 authors perceived the easier elements of SALT (like [[rhetorical blocks]] and marking that a text fragment is a claim) more certain to payoff, but struggled more with more complicated things like noting explicit relations between rhetorical elements, and including "domain knowledge" (p. 206, Fig. 8b)

        - [[WP: JCDL Where the semantic publishing rubber meets the scholarly practice road]] has some of our findings on this.

    - Important nuances that define the gap we want to fill

        - **who** is the user?

        - **what** is the nature of the semantic authoring? ontology? data? metadata? and what kind of referents?

        - **why** (for what purpose) is the semantic authoring?

        - **where** is the work being done?

        - what kind of **data** do we have about the experience?

- #appraisal although potentially relevant for answering #[[[[QUE]] - What is the user experience of semantic authoring within regular scholarly workflows?]], since [[sys/ClaiMapper]] was designed to be integrated into a normal [[scholarly workflows]] of making sense of a set of papers, this paper doesn't include any empirical insight into that question, since the system was only tested by the authors of the paper (p. 433)

- What's notable for us in the context of [[[[QUE]] - What is the user experience of semantic authoring within regular scholarly workflows?]] is that the assumption here is that this markup work is going to be done (willingly???) by **__authors__**

    - similar to [[@monsWhichGeneDid2005]], who correctly diagnoses that writing in a formal way (e.g., linking to established [[ontologies]]) is overly burdensome for authors BUT! still proposes that authors do a more lightweight version of it, with computer assistance

    - BUT, they find that, beyond the simple task of annotating [[rhetorical blocks]] like "abstract, motivation, conclusion", even the rarified sample of 8 researchers very familiar with [[Semantic Web]] found the interface and tasks quite tedious!

    - Let's collect

    - What we really want to know here is ^^"What is it like to actually to get from the "mess" of existing [[scholarly workflows]] to the [[formality]] of [[semantic publishing]] work that we want to power our [[D/Synthesis Infrastructure]]s?"^^
