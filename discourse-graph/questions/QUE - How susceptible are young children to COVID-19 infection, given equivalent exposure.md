- An important question to consider in the COVID-19 pandemic is the role of children in transmission. One half of the question concerns their susceptibility, compared to adults or other age groups.
- Here is a [[[[QUE]] - new question]]

- [[Playground for data on COVID and children]]

    - [[[[EVD]] - 30 percent lower household secondary attack rate for children vs. adults, ~2x lower than older adults, in Guangzhou - [[@jingHouseholdSecondaryAttack2020]]]]

        - this makes sense

    - [[[[EVD]] - Better model fit to Wuhan case data with age-dependent susceptibility, with children ~2x lower than adults - [[@cmmidcovid-19workinggroupAgedependentEffectsTransmission2020]]]]

        - this doesn't make sense!!
- # Synthesis

    - A reasonable prior for this question is that [children are equally susceptible to COVID compared to other age groups]([[[[CLM]] - Children are equally susceptible to COVID compared to other age groups]])

        - The following is [the case for]([[SupportedBy]]) this claim.

            - Bi et al [[@biEpidemiologyTransmissionCOVID192020]([[[[EVD]] - Similar secondary attack rate for children vs. adults in Shenzen - [[@biEpidemiologyTransmissionCOVID192020]]]])] found a similar secondary attack rate for children vs. adults in Shenzen.

            - See also: [[[[EVD]] - Comparable secondary attack rate in households in China for children under 3 compared to other age groups - [[@wuHouseholdTransmissionSARSCoV22020]]]]

            - And [[[[EVD]] - similar [[secondary attack rate]] for household contacts 18yo or less (compared to other age groups) in Midwestern US - [[@yousafProspectiveCohortStudy2020]]]]

    - But there seems to be a growing body of evidence that [children are less likely to contract COVID given equivalent exposure]([[[[CLM]] - Children are less likely to contract COVID given equivalent exposure]])

        - Some [support]([[SupportedBy]]) in epidemiological data showing age-related variability in susceptibility

            - There is some support in raw PCR case prevalence data for age-dependent susceptibility [@rosenbergCOVID19TestingEpidemic2020]([[[[EVD]] - prevalence of COVID (excluding first-reported case) increased with age in New York State, ~2x lower for children and youth compared to adults - [[@rosenbergCOVID19TestingEpidemic2020]]]]).

            - There are also some modeling studies that fit PCR case data and find better fits when susceptibility varies by age, with approximately 2x lower susceptibility for children compared to adults [[@zhangChangesContactPatterns2020]([[[[EVD]] - Model of contact tracing data from Hunan CDC estimates ~30 percent lower risk of infection for children vs. adults - [[@zhangChangesContactPatterns2020]]]]), [@cmmidcovid-19workinggroupAgedependentEffectsTransmission2020]([[[[EVD]] - Better model fit to Wuhan case data with age-dependent susceptibility, with children ~2x lower than adults - [[@cmmidcovid-19workinggroupAgedependentEffectsTransmission2020]]]])]. Since these rely on case data, it is not really possible to account for possible underreporting of mild/asymptomatic cases. Partially addressing this, Dattner et al [[@dattnerRoleChildrenSpread2020]([[[[EVD]] - Model of PCR data in Israel adjusted for under-detection of cases find 2x lower prevalence for children vs. adults - [[@dattnerRoleChildrenSpread2020]]]])] make adjustments in their model for under-detection of cases, and still estimate ~2x lower prevalence for children compared to adults.

        - Some [support]([[SupportedBy]]) in household attack rate studies that find lower [[secondary attack rate]]s for children

            - A number of contact tracing studies with exhaustive testing of close contacts find lower secondary attack rates amongst close contacts who are children (in the range of ~30% lower to up to 5x lower) [[@somekhRoleChildrenDynamics2020]([[[[EVD]] - 2x lower secondary attack rate for children compared to adults in exhaustive contact tracing study of 13 families in Central Israel - [[@somekhRoleChildrenDynamics2020]]]]), [@jingHouseholdSecondaryAttack2020]([[[[EVD]] - 30 percent lower household secondary attack rate for children vs. adults, ~2x lower than older adults, in Guangzhou - [[@jingHouseholdSecondaryAttack2020]]]]), [@liCharacteristicsHouseholdTransmission2020]([[[[EVD]] - 5x lower secondary attack rate for children compared to adults in households in China - [[@liCharacteristicsHouseholdTransmission2020]]]])].

            - [[[[EVD]] - Lower secondary attack rate in households in China for children 4-18 compared to other age groups - [[@wuHouseholdTransmissionSARSCoV22020]]]]

            - Some point estimates without direct comparison to adults also accord with these generally low estimates of secondary attack rates, such as  [[[[EVD]] - household secondary attack rate for children of index cases in Singapore was about 6 percent, and increased with age - [[@yungHouseholdTransmissionSevere2020]]]]

            - This is important because it helps address the potential objections around underreporting of cases from children from other contact tracing studies with similar results [[@wangHouseholdTransmissionSARSCoV22020]([[[[EVD]] - approximately 2x lower prevalence of secondary cases for children vs. adults in households in Wuhan - [[@wangHouseholdTransmissionSARSCoV22020]]]])]

        - Some [support]([[SupportedBy]]) in contract tracing studies in schools: zero (symptomatic) forward transmission to children.

            - Heavey et al [[@heaveyNoEvidenceSecondary2020]([[[[EVD]] - No secondary cases amongst 1k symptomatic close contacts of 6 index cases in school in Ireland - [[@heaveyNoEvidenceSecondary2020]]]])] found no secondary cases amongst 1k symptomatic close contacts of 6 index cases in a school in Ireland.

            - Yung et al [[@yungNovelCoronavirus20192020]([[@yungNovelCoronavirus20192020]])] reported three case clusters: one in a [preschool with adults as index cases]([[[[EVD]] - No secondary cases amongst preschoolers in a COVID cluster in Singapore with adults as index cases - [[@yungNovelCoronavirus20192020]]]]), another in a [preschool with a student as the index case]([[[[EVD]] - No secondary cases amongst preschoolers in a COVID cluster in Singapore with a student as index case - [[@yungNovelCoronavirus20192020]]]]), and a third in a [secondary school with adults as index cases]([[[[EVD]] - No secondary cases amongst secondary school students in a COVID cluster in Singapore with adults as index cases - [[@yungNovelCoronavirus20192020]]]]). In all three settings, no secondary cases were found amongst students.

            - An important limitation of these studies is that secondary cases are often identified through symptomatic testing, raising the possibility of underreporting, particularly given [significantly lower rates of symptomatic/severe COVID amongst children]([[[[CLM]] - Children are less likely to contract symptomatic or severe COVID]]).

        - Some [[SupportedBy]] in meta-analyses

            - [[[[EVD]] - meta-analysis of 11 household transmission studies estimated ~2x lower susceptibility for children vs. adults - [[@zhuChildrenAreUnlikely2020]]]]

        - There are still open [objections/limitations]([[Opposed By]]) to consider (see [[@hydeDifferenceSARSCoV2Attack2021]] for a review)

            - Lower prevalence of COVID in children might be [explained by underreporting of mild and asymptomatic cases]([[[[CLM]] - Lower prevalence of COVID in children might be explained by underreporting of mild and asymptomatic cases]]).

                - [Rebuttal]([[Opposed By]]):

                    - A valid concern! But we do have a number of contact tracing studies with exhaustive testing [[@somekhRoleChildrenDynamics2020]([[[[EVD]] - 2x lower secondary attack rate for children compared to adults in exhaustive contact tracing study of 13 families in Central Israel - [[@somekhRoleChildrenDynamics2020]]]]), [@jingHouseholdSecondaryAttack2020]([[[[EVD]] - 30 percent lower household secondary attack rate for children vs. adults, ~2x lower than older adults, in Guangzhou - [[@jingHouseholdSecondaryAttack2020]]]]), [@liCharacteristicsHouseholdTransmission2020]([[[[EVD]] - 5x lower secondary attack rate for children compared to adults in households in China - [[@liCharacteristicsHouseholdTransmission2020]]]])] that find similarly lower estimates of susceptibility for children as other studies that don't have exhaustive testing, and also a modeling study with adjustments for underreporting of cases [[@dattnerRoleChildrenSpread2020]([[[[EVD]] - Model of PCR data in Israel adjusted for under-detection of cases find 2x lower prevalence for children vs. adults - [[@dattnerRoleChildrenSpread2020]]]])]

            - Lower prevalence of COVID in children might be [explained by significantly muted contact patterns in children vs. adults during the pandemic, due to school closures]([[[[CLM]] - Lower prevalence of COVID in children might be explained by significantly muted contact patterns in children vs. adults during the pandemic, due to school closures]])

                - [Rebuttal]([[Opposed By]]):

                    - This is hard to rule out completely, but we do have some studies that have similar/equated exposure rates for adults vs. children, in schools [[@heaveyNoEvidenceSecondary2020]([[[[EVD]] - No secondary cases amongst 1k symptomatic close contacts of 6 index cases in school in Ireland - [[@heaveyNoEvidenceSecondary2020]]]]), [@yungNovelCoronavirus20192020]([[@yungNovelCoronavirus20192020]])]

                    - Household contact studies are also important if testing is exhaustive and index cases are caregivers, since contact patterns with potential infectious individuals would be *higher* for children! And here we still frequently see lower [[secondary attack rate]]s [[@somekhRoleChildrenDynamics2020]([[[[EVD]] - 2x lower secondary attack rate for children compared to adults in exhaustive contact tracing study of 13 families in Central Israel - [[@somekhRoleChildrenDynamics2020]]]]), [@jingHouseholdSecondaryAttack2020]([[[[EVD]] - 30 percent lower household secondary attack rate for children vs. adults, ~2x lower than older adults, in Guangzhou - [[@jingHouseholdSecondaryAttack2020]]]]), [@liCharacteristicsHouseholdTransmission2020]([[[[EVD]] - 5x lower secondary attack rate for children compared to adults in households in China - [[@liCharacteristicsHouseholdTransmission2020]]]])].

                        - This set is particularly important because the studies also include exhaustive testing of close contacts in addition to some ability to equate for exposure (same household).

            - There is some unevenness in how children are defined, which creates challenges for granular reasoning about age-dependent susceptibility

                - [[@zhangChangesContactPatterns2020]([[[[EVD]] - Model of contact tracing data from Hunan CDC estimates ~30 percent lower risk of infection for children vs. adults - [[@zhangChangesContactPatterns2020]]]])] draws the cutoff at 14 yo.

                - [[@dattnerRoleChildrenSpread2020]([[[[EVD]] - Model of PCR data in Israel adjusted for under-detection of cases find 2x lower prevalence for children vs. adults - [[@dattnerRoleChildrenSpread2020]]]])] draws the cutoff at 19 yo.

                - [[@zhuChildrenAreUnlikely2020]] draws the cutoff at 18yo.

            - Age-dependent susceptibility may not hold for newer variants

                - Most of these studies are from early in the pandemic

                    - {{[[TODO]]}} Need to find more recent studies that directly cover periods and regions where new variants are prevalent

        - Might be enough to get a more specific estimate of the range of how *much* lower. Some estimates might cluster around ~1/2 as likely, but let's keep that off the table until we've grokked more of the evidence

    - The evidence reviewed so far leans towards the conclusion that children have lower prevalence compared to adults. But, because this sort of goes against priors and "common sense", we should proceed with some caution, and be on the lookout for disconfirming evidence, and also better understand what is going on.
