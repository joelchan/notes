- An important question to consider in the COVID-19 pandemic is the role of children in transmission. One half of the question concerns their susceptibility, compared to adults or other age groups.
- Here is a [[QUE - new question]]

    - [[EVD - 30 percent lower household secondary attack rate for children vs. adults, ~2x lower than older adults, in Guangzhou - @jingHouseholdSecondaryAttack2020]]

        - this makes sense

    - [[EVD - Better model fit to Wuhan case data with age-dependent susceptibility, with children ~2x lower than adults - @cmmidcovid-19workinggroupAgedependentEffectsTransmission2020]]

        - this doesn't make sense!!
- # Synthesis

    - A reasonable prior for this question is that [children are equally susceptible to COVID compared to other age groups]([[CLM - Children are equally susceptible to COVID compared to other age groups]]

        - The following is [the case for]([[SupportedBy]]

            - Bi et al [[@biEpidemiologyTransmissionCOVID192020]([[EVD - Similar secondary attack rate for children vs. adults in Shenzen - @biEpidemiologyTransmissionCOVID192020]]

            - See also: [[EVD - Comparable secondary attack rate in households in China for children under 3 compared to other age groups - @wuHouseholdTransmissionSARSCoV22020]]

            - And [[EVD - similar secondary attack rate for household contacts 18yo or less (compared to other age groups) in Midwestern US - @yousafProspectiveCohortStudy2020]]

    - But there seems to be a growing body of evidence that [children are less likely to contract COVID given equivalent exposure]([[CLM - Children are less likely to contract COVID given equivalent exposure]]

        - Some [support]([[SupportedBy]]

            - There is some support in raw PCR case prevalence data for age-dependent susceptibility [@rosenbergCOVID19TestingEpidemic2020]([[EVD - prevalence of COVID (excluding first-reported case) increased with age in New York State, ~2x lower for children and youth compared to adults - @rosenbergCOVID19TestingEpidemic2020]]

            - There are also some modeling studies that fit PCR case data and find better fits when susceptibility varies by age, with approximately 2x lower susceptibility for children compared to adults [[@zhangChangesContactPatterns2020]([[EVD - Model of contact tracing data from Hunan CDC estimates ~30 percent lower risk of infection for children vs. adults - @zhangChangesContactPatterns2020]]

        - Some [support]([[SupportedBy]]

            - A number of contact tracing studies with exhaustive testing of close contacts find lower secondary attack rates amongst close contacts who are children (in the range of ~30% lower to up to 5x lower) [[@somekhRoleChildrenDynamics2020]([[EVD - 2x lower secondary attack rate for children compared to adults in exhaustive contact tracing study of 13 families in Central Israel - @somekhRoleChildrenDynamics2020]]

            - [[EVD - Lower secondary attack rate in households in China for children 4-18 compared to other age groups - @wuHouseholdTransmissionSARSCoV22020]]

            - Some point estimates without direct comparison to adults also accord with these generally low estimates of secondary attack rates, such as  [[EVD - household secondary attack rate for children of index cases in Singapore was about 6 percent, and increased with age - @yungHouseholdTransmissionSevere2020]]

            - This is important because it helps address the potential objections around underreporting of cases from children from other contact tracing studies with similar results [[@wangHouseholdTransmissionSARSCoV22020]([[EVD - approximately 2x lower prevalence of secondary cases for children vs. adults in households in Wuhan - @wangHouseholdTransmissionSARSCoV22020]]

        - Some [support]([[SupportedBy]]

            - Heavey et al [[@heaveyNoEvidenceSecondary2020]([[EVD - No secondary cases amongst 1k symptomatic close contacts of 6 index cases in school in Ireland - @heaveyNoEvidenceSecondary2020]]

            - Yung et al [[@yungNovelCoronavirus20192020]([[@yungNovelCoronavirus20192020]]

            - An important limitation of these studies is that secondary cases are often identified through symptomatic testing, raising the possibility of underreporting, particularly given [significantly lower rates of symptomatic/severe COVID amongst children]([[CLM - Children are less likely to contract symptomatic or severe COVID]]

        - Some [[SupportedBy]]

            - [[EVD - meta-analysis of 11 household transmission studies estimated ~2x lower susceptibility for children vs. adults - @zhuChildrenAreUnlikely2020]]

        - There are still open [objections/limitations]([[Opposed By]]

            - Lower prevalence of COVID in children might be [explained by underreporting of mild and asymptomatic cases]([[CLM - Lower prevalence of COVID in children might be explained by underreporting of mild and asymptomatic cases]]

                - [Rebuttal]([[Opposed By]]

                    - A valid concern! But we do have a number of contact tracing studies with exhaustive testing [[@somekhRoleChildrenDynamics2020]([[EVD - 2x lower secondary attack rate for children compared to adults in exhaustive contact tracing study of 13 families in Central Israel - @somekhRoleChildrenDynamics2020]]

            - Lower prevalence of COVID in children might be [explained by significantly muted contact patterns in children vs. adults during the pandemic, due to school closures]([[CLM - Lower prevalence of COVID in children might be explained by significantly muted contact patterns in children vs. adults during the pandemic, due to school closures]]

                - [Rebuttal]([[Opposed By]]

                    - This is hard to rule out completely, but we do have some studies that have similar/equated exposure rates for adults vs. children, in schools [[@heaveyNoEvidenceSecondary2020]([[EVD - No secondary cases amongst 1k symptomatic close contacts of 6 index cases in school in Ireland - @heaveyNoEvidenceSecondary2020]]

                    - Household contact studies are also important if testing is exhaustive and index cases are caregivers, since contact patterns with potential infectious individuals would be *higher* for children! And here we still frequently see lower [[secondary attack rate]]

                        - This set is particularly important because the studies also include exhaustive testing of close contacts in addition to some ability to equate for exposure (same household).

            - There is some unevenness in how children are defined, which creates challenges for granular reasoning about age-dependent susceptibility

                - [[@zhangChangesContactPatterns2020]([[EVD - Model of contact tracing data from Hunan CDC estimates ~30 percent lower risk of infection for children vs. adults - @zhangChangesContactPatterns2020]]

                - [[@dattnerRoleChildrenSpread2020]([[EVD - Model of PCR data in Israel adjusted for under-detection of cases find 2x lower prevalence for children vs. adults - @dattnerRoleChildrenSpread2020]]

                - [[@zhuChildrenAreUnlikely2020]]

            - Age-dependent susceptibility may not hold for newer variants

                - Most of these studies are from early in the pandemic

                    - {{[[TODO]]

        - Might be enough to get a more specific estimate of the range of how *much* lower. Some estimates might cluster around ~1/2 as likely, but let's keep that off the table until we've grokked more of the evidence

    - The evidence reviewed so far leans towards the conclusion that children have lower prevalence compared to adults. But, because this sort of goes against priors and "common sense", we should proceed with some caution, and be on the lookout for disconfirming evidence, and also better understand what is going on.
