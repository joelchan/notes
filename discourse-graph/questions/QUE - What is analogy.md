- # Synthesis

    - [[[[CLM]] - Analogies are fundamentally about relational similarity]]

    - classic analogy example: solar system and atom - v different on surface (size, color, domain), but structurally v similar

    - far analogies are ones where the two items are structurally/relationally similar but different on the surface. the solar system and atom fits this. another might be an analogy between ant colonies and organizations:  both include mechanisms for coordinating many agents towards goals, but they are v. different on the surface (insects vs. humans, size, types of goals, biological vs. "man-made").

    - [[@gentnerStructureMappingAnalogy1997]] distinguishes [[Analogy]] from similarity and metaphor - key idea is that it is based on similarity in terms of *relations*, in spite of or instead of attribute/feature (dis)similarities

    - [[@gentnerStructureMappingTheoretical1983]] is a foundational paper that specifies analogy in a more formal way

    - related: [[@holyoakAnalogicalMappingConstraint1989]] - what counts as "structure" vs. "surface" is constrained by pragmatics - the current goals. it's not a constant. [[[[CLM]] - Division of structural vs. surface features in analogical mapping varies is not constant; it varies by task.]]
