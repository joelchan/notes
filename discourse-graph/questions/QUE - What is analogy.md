- # Synthesis

    - [[CLM - Analogies are fundamentally about relational similarity]]

    - classic analogy example: solar system and atom - v different on surface (size, color, domain), but structurally v similar

    - far analogies are ones where the two items are structurally/relationally similar but different on the surface. the solar system and atom fits this. another might be an analogy between ant colonies and organizations:  both include mechanisms for coordinating many agents towards goals, but they are v. different on the surface (insects vs. humans, size, types of goals, biological vs. "man-made").
