    - Description

        - One effect that is attributed to design [[ðŸ§± fixation]] is the idea that [[[[CLM]] - Recent or concurrent exposure to ideas can substantially influence the direction of ideation]] (the positive side of this is [[[[CLM]] - Examples can improve creative outcomes by stimulating more exploration away from obvious starting points]])

            - One classic paper on this is [[@janssonDesignFixation1991]], who reported that [[[[EVD]] - design students transferred flawed features from an example even though the flaws were described as negative - [[@janssonDesignFixation1991]]]]

            - Some later work didn't find this effect when people are given instructions.

                - This is reminiscent of the general effects of instructions on creative performance, including [[@gickAnalogicalProblemSolving1980]]

                - Makes me think of the [role of]([[[[CLM]] - Executive functions, such as cognitive control and inhibition, are a net positive for generating creative ideas]]) [[executive function]] in creative work, as a complement/alternative explanation for things like the [[serial order effect]]

                    - And a related idea is [[retrieval-induced forgetting]]

                        - The idea here is that activating something in memory (which is what happens when you engage with an example) not only spreads activation to make other ideas more likely, but can also *compete* with other ideas and make them *less* likely to show up. I think this is why [[ðŸ§± fixation]] can feel so powerful

                        - critical narrative review in [[@stormProgressReportInhibitory2012]]

                        - This leads to the flip side of the activation stuff (kind of like [[ðŸ§± fixation]]): explanation of [[ðŸ§± incubation]] effects in terms of beneficial forgetting [[[[CL]] - Selective forgetting explains incubation effects in creative work]]

                            - Although [[@sioRoleIncubationPeriod2007]]'s results with a RAT didn't support the results

                - [[[[QUE]] - What are some major phenomena around designers' exploration of design spaces and how might these map to characteristics of optimizers?]]

        - But there are also longer-term effects that can be thought of in this way, including phenomena like [[Einstellung]] and [[functional fixedness]]

            - This is normally thought of as the curse of [[expertise]]

            - although the raw numbers are quite high (I believe these are proportion of all designs, vs. average of proportions per subject, which is also kind of sketchy)

- While surfing through the graph to write out some thoughts for [[[[QUE]] - What is the relationship between prior knowledge and new ideas?]], came across this stray thought: In studies of human [[expertise]], we find that [[Chunking]] in memory is a major enabler of expert thinking [[@chaseMindEyeChess1973]]: experts are able to think "bigger", more complex thoughts by compressing complex ideas into memory chunks to overcome the limitations of working memory (+/- 4 [[@cowanMagicalNumberShortterm2000]], which we previously thought was 7)

    - Reminds me very much of the idea of [[[[Chunk]] tightness]], and the notion that [[[[CL]] - Compression and contextualizability are in tension]]

- Reading [[@wardStructuredImaginationRole1994]] for [[[[QUE]] - What is the relationship between prior knowledge and new ideas?]]

    - **What does this source contribute for these questions?** ((blockref in observation notes and other interesting notes from the paper to discuss here)) #lit-context

        - In Experiment 1, Ward reported that his participants [overwhelmingly used typical features]([Undergraduate students](((GLVjpDndf))) who were [asked to draw imaginary animals](((zwS0EXV9n))) frequently drew animals with [features](((3M9PoLNDg))) that were [typical of earth animals](((CwNnKVLFv))), such as bilateral symmetry, legs/arms/wings, and typical numbers of appendages and sense organs (e.g. two eyes/ears, one nose, two/four legs), although a substantial number of [drawings](((hYbIddsIH))) also had a [limited number of differences from earth animals](((O1BIsqaIh))), such as unusual sense organs or appendages.) from earth animals, such as bilateral symmetry, and [tended not to vary "core features"](((caor_iQvz))) such as appendages and organs when varying exemplars within species, consistent with attribute-listing studies. Based on this, Ward argues that people's imagination is structured by their knowledge of both features and how animals tend to vary in features, based on the fact

            - Should grab those attribute listing studies: Tversky & Hemenway 1974 is one

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FwYg5RWef4Q.png?alt=media&token=1e977ebd-3713-47bc-bc18-ea1ef32b4854)

            - Should note, at least in Experiment 1 and 2, no particular instructions are given to be creative: in fact, it's hard to tell what the students were expecting in terms of what counts as "good" for the task.

                - So it's hard to extrapolate this to real settings where people might have higher/lower motivation to be creative. I'm not even sure if this is the "base state". It's a data point, but I'm not quite sure how to contextualize a set of undergrad intro psych students doing this task for course credit wrt the population we actually care about: professionals trying to be creative in their jobs or endeavors they care about.

        - Skimming ahead, it looks like:

            - Experiment 2 is about another aspect of structuring: feature correlations, and also a potential mechanism of retrieving specific exemplars

            - Experiment 3 and 4 probe this mechanism of retrieving specific exemplars (again, I'm dubious that this is just a fact about how "people" do things...)

            - Experiment 5 is a bit more interesting: it analyzes imagined animals in science fiction writers. This helps me [think through](So it's hard to extrapolate this to real settings where people might have higher/lower motivation to be creative. I'm not even sure if this is the "base state". It's a data point, but I'm not quite sure how to contextualize a set of undergrad intro psych students doing this task for course credit wrt the population we actually care about: professionals trying to be creative in their jobs or endeavors they care about.) how the findings might relate to real-world settings.

    - These are fun to do, but probably not super urgent. Can chip away at them. More important and urgent would be studies and findings around [analogies]([[[[QUE]] - How might domain distance modulate the effects of analogies on creative output?]]) and [people and cross-boundary information]([[[[QUE]] - What are the most efficient routes to useful cross-boundary knowledge?]]) more specifically.

    - Honestly, feeling a bit overwhelmed by the prospect.

        - Can it be done faster? I'm not sure that it should! I don't think I was doing that much on the tech side: pace felt kind of like how one might do it with a regular template, or analog workflow like [[Raul Pacheco-Vega]]'s: it just takes time to read a paper well!

        - Feeling uncomfortable now with the idea of just using knowledge I haven't vetted.

        - It takes time to read! I should have done this well during my PhD!

        - This might be the high barrier to entry for people who are already further along: less of a problem I think if you're starting from this point. Or I guess if you have a single project to start with.
