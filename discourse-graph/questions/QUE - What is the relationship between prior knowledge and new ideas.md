    - Description

        - One effect that is attributed to design [[ðŸ§± fixation]]

            - One classic paper on this is [[@janssonDesignFixation1991]]

            - Some later work didn't find this effect when people are given instructions.

                - This is reminiscent of the general effects of instructions on creative performance, including [[@gickAnalogicalProblemSolving1980]]

                - Makes me think of the [role of]([[CLM - Executive functions, such as cognitive control and inhibition, are a net positive for generating creative ideas]]

                    - And a related idea is [[retrieval-induced forgetting]]

                        - The idea here is that activating something in memory (which is what happens when you engage with an example) not only spreads activation to make other ideas more likely, but can also *compete* with other ideas and make them *less* likely to show up. I think this is why [[ðŸ§± fixation]]

                        - meta-analytic review in [[@murayamaForgettingConsequenceRetrieval2014]]

                        - critical narrative review in [[@stormProgressReportInhibitory2012]]

                        - This leads to the flip side of the activation stuff (kind of like [[ðŸ§± fixation]]

                            - Although [[@sioRoleIncubationPeriod2007]]

                - [[QUE - What are some major phenomena around designers' exploration of design spaces and how might these map to characteristics of optimizers]]

        - But there are also longer-term effects that can be thought of in this way, including phenomena like [[Einstellung]]

            - This is normally thought of as the curse of [[expertise]]
