    - elements

        - constraints / requirements

        - space of possible moves

        - maybeeee also

            - reward model / distribution of "good" solutions?

            - generic "features" of the problem?

    - observations / sources

        - in [[[[EVD]] - Engineering design students used multiple cross-domain analogies to fulfill design needs, and they could use analogies to get inspiration of how to decompose the problem and find new analogies. - [[@helmsCompoundAnalogicalDesign2008]]]] it is mainly constraints / requirements (problem decomposition)

        - in [[[[EVD]] - designers used examples to shape their understanding of the problem before generating solutions - [[@herringGettingInspiredUnderstanding2009]]]], it is constraints / requirements (what is required) and ((PMOARqJZ1)) ("what else is out there")

        - in [[[[EVD]] - professional designers curated examples to understand trends and design approaches to inform their design, vs. simple direct transfer of solution approaches - [[@sharminUnderstandingKnowledgeManagement2009b]]]] it is space of possible moves ([visual trends, styles](((H-95Ks8pm))), directions)

        - in [[[[EVD]] - Two artists used individual artworks to shape not just their ideas, but used a process of "analogical modification" to search for and modify higher-order concepts, and their creative vision. This process unfolded over the course of years. - [[@okadaAnalogicalModificationCreation2009]]]], it is constraints / requirements (creative vision, "how to see", "how should the world be viewed), as well as ((PMOARqJZ1)) (super-ordinate concepts and expressive techniques)

        - models / theory

            - in [[@dorstCoreDesignThinking2011]]'s formulation of [[Frames]] and [[ðŸ§± framing]], it consists of a specification of an approach (how: space of possible moves) as well as value/goal (i.e., ((NelovND9C)))

            - in simon's theory of problem solving (many refs, but see, eg., [[@simonStructureIllStructured1973]]; canonical cite is [[@newellElementsTheoryHuman1958]], and later on, the book: [[@newellHumanProblemSolving1972]]), it's a [[problem space]], which consists of

                - similar in [[@goelStructureDesignProblem1992]]

                - states, which is like reward model / distribution of "good" solutions?

                - operators, which are basically space of possible moves

                - tests / goal, which distinguishes constraints / requirements
