- # Synthesis

    - need to extract some qualitative/quantitative sense of **magnitude** here

        - [[[[EVD]] - case-based reasoning system loaded with diverse cases increased overall novelty of ad campaign ideas, but only for people with lower creative ability - [[@althuizenSupportingCreativeProblem2014]]]]

        - [[[[EVD]] - case-based reasoning system loaded with diverse cases increased overall usefulness and creativity of ad campaign ideas, especially for people with lower creative ability - [[@althuizenSupportingCreativeProblem2014]]]]

        - [[[[EVD]] - Only small business owners with high divergent thinking ability generated more ideas with diverse (vs. constrained) stimuli - [[@gielnikCreativityOpportunityIdentification2011]]]]

    - From [diss](from my [diss](http://joelchan.me/assets/pdf/dissertation.pdf) (sadly, I didn't take detailed notes in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/0B1J84EpLdwM4TldPYzBxdndLVlk/edit?resourcekey=0-T0DGXjeOISNq_Wd3H9KAeQ#gid=491418002) the same way i did for distance):) (can expand from there too) #[[âž° breadcrumbs]]
