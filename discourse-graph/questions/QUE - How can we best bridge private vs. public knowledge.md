- # Synthesis

    - This question is basically about knowledge reuse, esp. across boundaries

    - Possibilities

        - [[CLM - It is possible to benefit from receiving intermediate sensemaking outputs from others, particularly if those outputs have been iterated on]]

            - but: [[CLM - Organizations and schemas from others' intermediate sensemaking outputs may be more beneficial for distributed sensemaking compared to the content]]

    - Challenges:

        - [[CLM - Most private annotations aren't useful to other people]]

            - Possibly because [[CLM - Knowledge must be recontextualized to be usefully reused]]

            - But also possibly because a lot of what we do in terms of externalization is [[Epistemic Action]]

                - See, e.g, [[@americaninstituteofphysicsInterviewRichardFeyman2015]]

                - Related: gestures, [[distributed cognition]]

        - [[CLM - Context and privacy are in tension when sharing knowledge with others]]

        - [[that can't pin it down local optimum tradeoff thing]]

            - [[EVD - professional designers lacked robust and consistent organization and metadata for ideas and examples, which hampered reuse - @sharminUnderstandingKnowledgeManagement2009b]]

            - To properly deal with a [discrepancy in benefits from the caller](((aJyU_lBdO))), a [HLG employee](((95SLsSLsN))) needed to [[reuse]]

        - [[@luttersBoundaryObjectsCollaborative2007]]

            - In a field study ([1](((wZTjEVa0W))), [2](((PxBZyhifs)))) of collaborative information reuse in aircraft technical support, [engineers](((bN1lFNGQF))) lamented reusing [old records](((hiZNe4PgH))) because information was [missing, outdated, or not appropriate anymore](((iMmo84-Q5))) because of procedural changes. Over the years if any changes to the records were [not tagged](((u6oO3mu-M))), the context of those changes were lost.

        - [[@dourishInformationContextLessons1993]]

            - In [a case study of calendar systems](((e021Zn_8X))), having [metadata for event information](((H-T2qFmhr))) such as the title of the event or arrival time of the speaker, in addition to who the author of the information is, were critical for the interpretation of the events.

        - [[@hinrichsContextGrabbingAssigning2005]]

            - [Decentralized project documentation](((BMX6-DOV6))) made recontextualization difficult for [engineers](((CUoGHVXbV))) because they didn't know the [history of changes for a document or if a particular document was up to date](((ANL0-Gihc))), leading to issues such as ["exploratory digging by hand" to avoid damaging power lines](((ZXWd_oKNJ))) pg 375

        - [[@andersonDataBaseMent2008]]

            - In a [case study](((1NQJ4Lkwn))) (methods [1](((HH7e2hyT2))), [2](((8pTMoQtJD)))), Healthcare workers used a system which featured a drop-down menu that would allow them to select relevant contextual information to attach to a file where they recorded patient interactions. However, the options in the [drop-down menu](((SdDwD5xWe))) were frequently [not specific enough, or too many options were available](((_b8X5Ey1Z))), which led to the employees [choosing the closest option, or a catch all “Not Specified” option](((w-26O9uLq))). This all led to ambiguous contextual information capture which [proved problematic down the line](((IxXKHy5DM))).
