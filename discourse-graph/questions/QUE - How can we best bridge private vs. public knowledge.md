- # Synthesis

    - This question is basically about knowledge reuse, esp. across boundaries

    - Challenges:

        - [[[[CLM]] - Most private annotations aren't useful to other people]]

            - Possibly because [[[[CLM]] - Knowledge must be recontextualized to be usefully reused]], and [[[[CLM]] - Specifying context for future reuse is costly]]

            - But also possibly because a lot of what we do in terms of externalization is [[Epistemic Action]] that *is* thinking in the moment, not necessarily producing a record that will be in any way useful after the moment. #[[🌲 zettels]]

                - See, e.g, [[@americaninstituteofphysicsInterviewRichardFeyman2015]]

                - Related: gestures, [[distributed cognition]] / [[Morphological Computation]]?

        - [[[[CLM]] - Context and privacy are in tension when sharing knowledge with others]]

        - [[that can't pin it down local optimum tradeoff thing]] / structure now vs. structure later

            - [[[[EVD]] - professional designers lacked robust and consistent organization and metadata for ideas and examples, which hampered reuse - [[@sharminUnderstandingKnowledgeManagement2009b]]]]

            - To properly deal with a [discrepancy in benefits from the caller](((aJyU_lBdO))), a [HLG employee](((95SLsSLsN))) needed to [[reuse]] information from the [CARL database](((OLechJ6p6))), among other sources of information, to create an escalation to the benefits group. To do this, she needed important [[context]] that was missing from the CARL record itself, such as details of the record's creation or maintenance (was it authoritative?), and any circumstances surrounding the caller's employment. The HLG employee dealt with this missing context by consulting an expert (a senior agent) and her own memory, rather than searching databases for additional information, even though that information could in principle be in there.

        - [[@luttersBoundaryObjectsCollaborative2007]]

            - In a field study ([1](((wZTjEVa0W))), [2](((PxBZyhifs)))) of collaborative information reuse in aircraft technical support, [engineers](((bN1lFNGQF))) lamented reusing [old records](((hiZNe4PgH))) because information was [missing, outdated, or not appropriate anymore](((iMmo84-Q5))) because of procedural changes. Over the years if any changes to the records were [not tagged](((u6oO3mu-M))), the context of those changes were lost.

            - [Decentralized project documentation](((BMX6-DOV6))) made recontextualization difficult for [engineers](((CUoGHVXbV))) because they didn't know the [history of changes for a document or if a particular document was up to date](((ANL0-Gihc))), leading to issues such as ["exploratory digging by hand" to avoid damaging power lines](((ZXWd_oKNJ))) pg 375

            - In a [case study](((1NQJ4Lkwn))) (methods [1](((HH7e2hyT2))), [2](((8pTMoQtJD)))), Healthcare workers used a system which featured a drop-down menu that would allow them to select relevant contextual information to attach to a file where they recorded patient interactions. However, the options in the [drop-down menu](((SdDwD5xWe))) were frequently [not specific enough, or too many options were available](((_b8X5Ey1Z))), which led to the employees [choosing the closest option, or a catch all “Not Specified” option](((w-26O9uLq))). This all led to ambiguous contextual information capture which [proved problematic down the line](((IxXKHy5DM))).

        - Approach

            - Coming from sociological background and stance (in American Journal of Sociology), but is computational social science

            - Draws on [[information theory]], including [[@shannonMathematicalTheoryCommunication1948]] and [[Shannon Entropy]].

        - Claimed contributions

            - results that show how ambiguity acts like a [[[[PTN]] - boundary object]] that stimulates social learning (not sure how this is going to be shown)

    - # Implications / Discussion

        - Authors want to claim that reductions in ambiguity could be bad for science bc they reduce fragmentation. And therefore we should be careful about trying to remove ambiguity.

            - But I'm not entirely convinced, for two reasons.

                - Effect size here is very small.

                - Not clear to me that fragmentation per se is bad - feel like we need to have a sense of useful "set points" or equilibria for this parameter.

                    - See, e.g., suggestions of [[Zollman Effect]]

            - In favor of this:

                - ideas around [[🧱 sensemaking]] and [[[[PTN]] - incremental formalization]] (see, e.g., [[@shipmanFormalityConsideredHarmful1999]])

                - phenomenon of [[Scatter]] is thought to be [major reason interdisciplinarity is hard]([[[[CLM]] - Interdisciplinary synthesis is hard because of scatter in the literature]])

                - Representing ideas more abstractly in terms of [[Schemas]] in can facilitate [analogical]([[analogy]]) transfer

        - Other connections/seeds for thought

            - Against "objectivity theater" (h/t [[Alan (Red) Ransil]])

            - What are the implications here for [[interoperability]], maybe vs. standardization?

                - Cc [[[[CLM]] - Knowledge is fundamentally contextual]] and potentially [[[[CLM]] - Universal Semantic Webs are neither feasible nor useful]]

                    - Past thinking on this:

                        - A fundamental uncertainty is whether the relatively formalized nature of [[[[PTN]] - discourse graph]] can be integrated with the open-ended, seemingly unstructured, backtrack-ridden, speculative and "half-baked" nature of thinking that underlies real synthesis (see [[@gruberDarwinManPsychological1974]] for vivid descriptions of this). Some past work on whether/how formality can be integrated into systems for supporting thinking suggests there is a real danger that imposing such formalisms may yield more harm (e.g., by cutting off speculative lines of inquiry, imposing too much overhead) than benefits in settings characterized by context-dependent, evolving requirements for formal structure, such as creative knowledge work in uncharted domains (see [[@shipmanFormalityConsideredHarmful1999]] for an excellent introduction to this). A related danger is that the kinds of knowledge that is necessary for

    - # Methods

        - [[ambiguity]] operationalized as word synonym entropy

            - define as posterior distribution over pr(M | t, c) (probability of each possible meaning for a given token in a given context) - see Appendix A (how to build "meaning graph" for each token), and Appendix B (how to estimate ambiguity)

                - very similar to [[LDA]]

                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FkBZZ_HTTGv.png?alt=media&token=1b9f4a7c-5f25-4555-82c0-4f2785d46fb6) (p. 898)

            - meaning simplified to proxy into synonyms from Moby and WordNet thesauri

                - would prefer to define as cliques in synonym graph, but... for reasons, decided to simplify to just directed edges + the neighborhood

            - validated against human judgments (see Appendix C)

            - examples (from data)

        - "engagement" operationalized as graph entropy over subgraph from each article for max (1k cites, 3 recursive runs), computed in terms of maximal [[network modularity]] (intuitively, a kind of "cliqueiness" or fragmentation, so higher here = lower engagement, i think)

    - # Goals

        - understand possible positive functions of ambiguity in scholarly discourse

        - figure out a way to quantitatively study this question!
[[May 7th, 2020]]

- Ok, so I think the most important and uncertain idea right now is the question [[[[QUE]] - How can we best bridge private vs. public knowledge?]]. I think that's where the interesting edge is, and it gives structure to the questions we are asking. That is ultimately the focus of the grant! And it's about "how might [[individual synthesis]] happen differently so we are able to answer [[[[QUE]] - How can we best bridge private vs. public knowledge?]]? We still have to sharpen it, though. But that will be the work of writing it.

- cc [[[[QUE]] - How can we best bridge private vs. public knowledge?]]

    - can you contemplate in public?

    - really reading a book has its effects perhaps more via creating a particular kind of space for thinking (not necessarily the "knowledge transfer")

- Thinking through [initial set of readings]({{[[DONE]]}} Joel will send some papers to [read](((JLBM1629Z))) and discuss next week, and we can discourse-graph them together) for [[Jay Patel]]. I'm thinking we should do a distributed sensemaking one first (theory side), and then mostly work our way through the reading list for [[[[QUE]] - How can we best bridge private vs. public knowledge?]]

    - So, start with [[@fisherDistributedSensemakingImproving2012]], and then [[@ribaupierreExtractingDiscourseElements2017]]

- #idea Undiscovered Private/Intermediate Knowledge --> [[[[QUE]] - How can we best bridge private vs. public knowledge?]]

    - Riffing off of [[Howard Gruber]]'s book on Darwin [[@gruberDarwinManPsychological1974]], there is a chapter on private and public knowledge

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FcSBiJYGMq_?alt=media&token=94933f94-e527-498a-b37d-015e00a8e6c1)

    - But I imagine there is a rich and teeming network of ideas that are living in people's notes (or in their heads) that can be a crazy powerful boost to creativity. I think this maps to [[Howard Gruber]]'s notion of "private knowledge", and is what he is studying when he analyzes Darwin's extensive notebook. He notes how much richer the ideas in there are, with more metaphors than the well-known branching tree of life, that constitute / ground / spark his key insights about evolution.

    - We have some infrastructure that facilitates transmission of intermediate knowledge. Twitter, for example. And blog posts. Are they good enough for what we want? Twitter, for example, privileges transmission of lossily compressed ideas. Blogposts do not aim for atomicity. And neither are composable in a powerful way (Twitter's threading and linking)

        - from [[Stian Håklev]]: https://medium.com/the-long-now-foundation/intellectual-dark-matter-2e5890aa8d8f

    - We have some interesting work in data / text mining that is attempting to discover undiscovered public knowledge

    - Our infrastructure right now mainly privileges transmission of public knowledge. Journals / formal proceedings as the lifeblood and currency.

    - And let's not forget, here is where privilege reigns the most: see, e.g.,

        - [[Ghost Theorems]] and [[Ghost Knowledge]] (and the general idea of [[epistemic injustice]])

        - Who gets to be "in the room where it happens"?

    - [[Nic Weber]] says I guess to clarify - I was thinking about what governs the construction of or justification of knowledge in a particular event… I would guess this event is governed by IP in important ways - for example https://www.wired.com/story/right-to-repair-medical-equipment-ifixit/ describes how there is a need to relax restrictions around repairing equipment and sharing information about how to effectively repair equipment during a shortage exacerbated by COVID 19

        - setting: 11 HCI grad students in a reading seminar, doing weekly readings (about 3 per week). assignment was to use WebAnn, a web-based annotation tool (readings converted to HTML), to share annotations with others. students were allowed to read on paper

        - sample: 49 readings from weeks where WebAnn was required, from 7 of 1 students (2 didn't give, 2 didn't annotate)

        - Is the example of Darwin, and Feynman, and so on a counterexample? No, i think Andy is making a more specific point than "most effective thinkers aren't doing a systematic thing with their "notes": he acknowledges that [effective thinkers think with a notebook](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5WDNZizsbAzE1p2BLwr339fV4TCpzNvaztP2), and cites Feyman as a canonical example

- Thinking through what is the most concrete and actionable subproject I can craft with [[Stian Håklev]] to push forward the idea of #[[[[QUE]] - How can we best bridge private vs. public knowledge?]].

    - Maybe a CSCW paper on a [[federation]]-powered distributed knowledge base for [[communities of practice]]?

        - We can use existing machinery like Gatsby, netlify. First test case: [[Ad-hoc Book Clubs]]. Recruit the digital gardeners as collaborators, maybe Angus, and Arvind?

            - Could address key technical overhead of "everyone needs to have their own server"?

                - Not conceptually very interesting though?

                    - But maybe it can enable us to deploy it to study what happens.

                        - Curious where it *is* happening already though.

        - Leave traces behind that foreground rather than background (as in talk pages on wikis) contention and diversity, yet still give more cohesion than a disconnected set of blogs?

        - Reminds me again of [[Stigmergic Coordination]] - and also not really doing a very directed co-production of a shared artifact (like a collaborative wiki), but the pre version of it. Sort of a step up from the fully distributed modal case like the scientific literature (very very loose federation, much less aggregation). Doesn't rule out the shared artifact

        - Related work: quick [[sys/Google Scholar]] search for "federated wikis" turns up a few papers, one of which is this one: #[[@davoustP2PediaPeertopeerWiki2015]]: Title: P2Pedia: a peer-to-peer wiki for decentralized collaboration

            - Interestingly, discusses application of the concept of [[sys/Federated Wikis]] (although with a more [[P2P]] technical difference of implementation) to academic writing.

        - each group can draw from

            - closer groups (e.g., collaborators):

                - more stable ledger stuff via the desci protocol
