- # Synthesis

    - This question is basically about knowledge reuse, esp. across boundaries

    - Possibilities

        - [[[[CLM]] - It is possible to benefit from receiving intermediate sensemaking outputs from others, particularly if those outputs have been iterated on]]

            - but: [[[[CLM]] - Organizations and schemas from others' intermediate sensemaking outputs may be more beneficial for distributed sensemaking compared to the content]]

    - Challenges:

        - [[[[CLM]] - Most private annotations aren't useful to other people]]

            - Possibly because [[[[CLM]] - Knowledge must be recontextualized to be usefully reused]], and [[[[CLM]] - Specifying context for future reuse is costly]]

            - But also possibly because a lot of what we do in terms of externalization is [[Epistemic Action]] that *is* thinking in the moment, not necessarily producing a record that will be in any way useful after the moment. #[[üå≤ zettels]]

                - See, e.g, [[@americaninstituteofphysicsInterviewRichardFeyman2015]]

                - Related: gestures, [[distributed cognition]] / [[Morphological Computation]]?

        - [[[[CLM]] - Context and privacy are in tension when sharing knowledge with others]]

        - [[that can't pin it down local optimum tradeoff thing]] / structure now vs. structure later

            - [[[[EVD]] - professional designers lacked robust and consistent organization and metadata for ideas and examples, which hampered reuse - [[@sharminUnderstandingKnowledgeManagement2009b]]]]

            - Ambiguity in language can be helpful for integrating work: even [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Thomas Kuhn]] were examples of work where language was ambiguous, and this ended up having positive effects on the science

            - To properly deal with a [discrepancy in benefits from the caller](((aJyU_lBdO))), a [HLG employee](((95SLsSLsN))) needed to [[reuse]] information from the [CARL database](((OLechJ6p6))), among other sources of information, to create an escalation to the benefits group. To do this, she needed important [[context]] that was missing from the CARL record itself, such as details of the record's creation or maintenance (was it authoritative?), and any circumstances surrounding the caller's employment. The HLG employee dealt with this missing context by consulting an expert (a senior agent) and her own memory, rather than searching databases for additional information, even though that information could in principle be in there.

            - In a field study ([1](((wZTjEVa0W))), [2](((PxBZyhifs)))) of collaborative information reuse in aircraft technical support, [engineers](((bN1lFNGQF))) lamented reusing [old records](((hiZNe4PgH))) because information was [missing, outdated, or not appropriate anymore](((iMmo84-Q5))) because of procedural changes. Over the years if any changes to the records were [not tagged](((u6oO3mu-M))), the context of those changes were lost.

        - [[@dourishInformationContextLessons1993]]

            - In [a case study of calendar systems](((e021Zn_8X))), having [metadata for event information](((H-T2qFmhr))) such as the title of the event or arrival time of the speaker, in addition to who the author of the information is, were critical for the interpretation of the events.

        - [[@hinrichsContextGrabbingAssigning2005]]

            - [Decentralized project documentation](((BMX6-DOV6))) made recontextualization difficult for [engineers](((CUoGHVXbV))) because they didn't know the [history of changes for a document or if a particular document was up to date](((ANL0-Gihc))), leading to issues such as ["exploratory digging by hand" to avoid damaging power lines](((ZXWd_oKNJ))) pg 375

        - [[@andersonDataBaseMent2008]]

            - In a [case study](((1NQJ4Lkwn))) (methods [1](((HH7e2hyT2))), [2](((8pTMoQtJD)))), Healthcare workers used a system which featured a drop-down menu that would allow them to select relevant contextual information to attach to a file where they recorded patient interactions. However, the options in the [drop-down menu](((SdDwD5xWe))) were frequently [not specific enough, or too many options were available](((_b8X5Ey1Z))), which led to the employees [choosing the closest option, or a catch all ‚ÄúNot Specified‚Äù option](((w-26O9uLq))). This all led to ambiguous contextual information capture which [proved problematic down the line](((IxXKHy5DM))).
