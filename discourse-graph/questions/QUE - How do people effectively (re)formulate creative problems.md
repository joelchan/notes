- **Clear (cognitive / process) model of problem formulation** One thing we need is a clear idea of what constitutes problem reformulation for people. What do people do? [[[[QUE]] - How do people effectively (re)formulate creative problems?]]. We need this so that we don't fall into the trap of just automating problem formulation. ^^Jason: Yes, our previous work [[@macneilFramingCreativeWork2021]] could contribute to that discussion.^^

    - One insight I want to make sure we write down is that problem reformulation isn't a task that happens in isolation. Instead there is co-evolution with "solution processes"; see, e.g., [[[[CLM]] - Design proceeds by co-evolution of problem and solution space]]

        - This implies that it is probably not only hard, but maybe even incoherent to try to do this task in isolation.

        - So one #[[âž° breadcrumbs]] here is to articulate a few coherent examples of problem formulation, ideally in real-world scenarios

            - Starting points:

                - [[@dorstCreativityDesignProcess2001]] and [[@schonReflectivePractitionerHow1983]]

    - Once we understand the pieces, of what people do, and what inputs and outputs they have, and when in the process this happens, we can start to decompose into coherent subtasks for AI. ^^Jason: Exactly, and I strongly recommend to talk to [[Stephen MacNeil]] who has worked on problem framing (with me) over the past three years.^^

        - Again, taking a "[[distributed cognition]]" lens to this.

        - I think this is ultimately where we want to get to: an understanding of the design problem of AI-assisted problem reformulation. Not autonomous problem reformulation, but AI-assisted or augmented.

            - One of the subtasks, to be sure, is to get a feeling for how to evaluate the outputs of the models. But to do that before we have a clear sense of what their *task* is, seems... backwards. We don't have to have a *complete* model, but we do need to have at least some plausible starting points.

    - This is a big task, however. Our focus here is on [analogical problem reformulation]([[[[CLM]] - Analogies can power creative breakthroughs by stimulating effective problem (re)formulation]])

    - [[@cassTransformYourIndustry2019]]

        - it's a case description (not formal academic) from [[IDEO]], illustrating how "analogous research" works, to help with problem reformulation

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FzVSHGBo3lX.png?alt=media&token=7429a5dd-5c4a-4463-9423-bd16376dbf65)

        - the case starting point is a hospital that wans to redesign the entire patient experience (super broad)

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F1S2czKyJ5I.png?alt=media&token=10aa6270-2c28-486e-a05d-47d8939cef8a)

        - they went to an airport for inspiration, to see what solutions and problems were there, based on a shared mapping of complexity of the experience, and a sense that this industry had invested in solutions to make it better (I am... personally doubtful? :P)

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FpRCmLLzPus.png?alt=media&token=5ef35b18-8897-4b3c-a588-af8c9ff9ff43)

        - what they noticed:

            - many different pathways for customers; in contrast to "one option" for their patients

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2Fc9qZnFjVSJ.png?alt=media&token=f6ce843e-fcbe-4556-8ded-c378053900d9)

            - customer service desk; a place to also go beyond the standard job description

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FZLcue5z0Ak.png?alt=media&token=a23503f5-a54f-4359-bb1a-4adf599d7412)

        - which led to ideas for prototypes to test

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FDxJdiST6ys.png?alt=media&token=136262ad-aaa4-49cb-bdb2-7308bde5f40e)

        - this case is evocative on the surface as an example (hospitals and airports!), but maybe isn't super insightful in the details. i particularly wish i had a better sense of where the problem formulations *started*; i can see from the examples where the problem formulations were *missing*, i guess, but i'm not sure if the problem to start with was too... high level?

        - what i'm noticing about this case:

            - how interleaved problems and solutions are... this feels important.

            - the immersive nature of the experience; it was embodied, not abstract; this kind of gets back to what [[AJ Rudd Jr]] is exploring

        - still, useful to reify this as a case/example: [[[[EVD]] - hospital workers reformulated the problem of designing a better patient experience based on insights from exploring an analogous setting of customer experience in airports - [[@cassTransformYourIndustry2019]]]]

    - and back to [[@schonReflectivePractitionerHow1983]]

        - > ...although problem setting is a necessary condition for technical problem solving, it is not itself a technical problem. When set the problem, we select what we will treat at the "things" of the situation, we set the boundaries of our attention to it, and we impose upon it a coherence which allows us to say what is wrong and in what directions the situation needs to be changed. Problem setting is a process in which, interactively we __name__ the things to which we will attend and __frame__ the context in which we will attend to them (p. 41)

            - great #quotes for [[problem (re)formulation]]

            - this noticing here reminds me very much of [[[[EVD]] - Representing a mutilated checkerboard in a way that made perceptual features of squares more salient facilitated problem reformulation and insight - [[@kaplanSearchInsight1990]]]]
