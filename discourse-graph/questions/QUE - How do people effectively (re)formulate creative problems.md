- # Synthesis

    - [[CLM - Design proceeds by co-evolution of problem and solution space]]

    - [[CLM - Effective problem formulation is-necessary-for creative knowledge work]]

    - [[CLM - Analogies can power creative breakthroughs by stimulating effective problem (re)formulation]]

    - [[CLM - examples can improve creative outcomes by enabling more robust (re)modeling of the problem space]]

    - Basic subprocesses:

        - Think of new constraints

        - Question assumptions

    - Unsorted
