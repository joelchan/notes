                        - This paper reports the results of a qualitative study on the process of learning complex concepts in chemistry by four students as they worked with FLiPS (Flexible Learning in the Periodic System), a cognitive ﬂexibility multi-media hypertext for learning about the periodic system of elements. A wide range of probes (think-alouds; navigation logs; observational notes, interviews; pre- and post-tests; epistemic beliefs survey; and background questionnaire) produced a rich data set for analysis. This data was analyzed to construct rich narrative case- and cross-case narratives of the participants’ process of working and learning in this complex hypertext environment. This multi-level analysis offers insight both into the ﬁne-grained process of use as well as the larger issues of the pedagogical signiﬁcance of FLiPS. Our analysis reveals a complex relationship between epistemic beliefs, student motivation, prior knowledge, and process of learning from hypertext. We offer implications for future research, design and the application of pedagogical hypertexts.

                    - Abstract

                        - A central premise of this article is that hypermedia tools may be developed for case and problem-centered learning in order to achieve significant learning outcomes such as deep conceptual understanding, conceptual change, and knowledge transfer. An approach for developing hypermedia case and problem-centered knowledge resources is proposed-the knowledge mediator framework (KMF)-which consists of design elements and learning activities that have specific sociocognitive theoretical and research rationales. A proof-of-concept study is then discussed; it involved high school students using a hypermedia system based on the main features of the KMF to learn neo-Darwinian evolutionary biology. ^^Students using the experimental hypermedia system were found to change their evolutionary biology problem-solving models, and to continue to use expert-like models even 1 year after using the system^^. The use of the KMF to develop hypermedia learning materials in other domains and for constructive student projects is also considered. Overall, it is hoped that the framework and research outlined in this article may contribute to design and pedagogical principles for hypermedia learning tools that help students construct rich and useful understandings of challenging knowledge.

                    - Abstract

                        - The words openness and flexibility—the latter is the topic of this volume—are joined in the title of this chapter. We see them as two sides of the same coin—structure and process, as well as antecedent and consequent. Closed structures of presentation (how instructional materials are organized in delivery systems) and of representation (how knowledge is structured and operated upon in the mind) produce rigidity of thought and action. The antithesis of this rigidity is a kind of “openness-based” flexibility necessary for adaptive knowledge application, for transfer of knowledge to new situations, for situation-sensitive use of knowledge, and for the kind of world-fitting complexity of understanding that cognitive flexibility depends upon—and that the increasingly complex modern world of life and work needs now more than ever. Rigidity and oversimplification are rampant in learning and teaching (e.g., Feltovich, Coulson, & Spiro, 2001; Feltovich, Spiro, & Coulson, 1989, 1996; Spiro, Feltovich, & Coulson, 1996), but with the affordances of new media, we do not need to live complacently with this state of affairs (Spiro, in press). The perspective of cognitive flexibility theory (CFT; Mishra, Spiro, & Feltovich, 1996; Spiro, Coulson, Feltovich, & Anderson, 1988, 2004; Spiro, Feltovich, Jacobson, & Coulson, 1992a, 1992b; Spiro & Jehng, 1990) enacts openness in many ways—in the theory itself and in the multimedia learning systems based on the theory (cognitive flexibility hypertext learning environments, CFHs). A recent overview of CFT can be found in Spiro, Collins, and Thota (2003).

                    - Abstract

                        - Although problem solving is regarded by most educators as among the most important learning outcomes, few instructional design prescriptions are available for designing problem-solving instruction and engaging learners. This paper distinguishes between well-structured problems and ill-structured problems. Well-structured problems are constrained problems with convergent solutions that engage the application of a limited number of rules and principles within well-defined parameters. Ill-structured problems possess multiple solutions, solution paths, fewer parameters which are less manipulable, and contain uncertainty about which concepts, rules, and principles are necessary for the solution or how they are organized and which solution is best. For both types of problems, this paper presents models for how learners solve them and models for designing instruction to support problem-solving skill development. The model for solving well-structured problems is based on information processing theories of learning, while the model for solving ill-structured problems relies on an emerging theory of ill-structured problem solving and on constructivist and situated cognition approaches to learning.

                    - Abstract

                        - Although the use of hypertext systems for learning complex knowledge has been attracting recent attention, we currently have poor theoretical and research perspectives from which to understand special characteristics associated with learning in nonlinear and multidimensional hypertext instructional systems. A study was conducted to investigate a theory-based hypertext learning environment that provided instruction in a complex and ill-structured domain. The experimental treatment incorporated several features derived from recent cognitive learning theory, in particular a hypertext procedure that presented the instructional material in multiple contexts to highlight different facets of the knowledge. The main results of the study revealed that although the control treatment led to higher performance on the measures of memory for factual knowledge, the more hypertext-like treatment promoted superior knowledge transfer. Overall, these findings suggest hypertext learning environments that present the instructed knowledge by explicitly demonstrating critical interrelationships between abstract and case-specific knowledge components in multiple contexts will help prepare students to use knowledge in new ways and in new situations.

[[idea around networked notetaking structuring semantic networks]]

- BUT: [most studies of this]([[[[QUE]] - Can hypertext notetaking systems enhance cognitive flexibility?]]) are in ed/classroom (vs. real-world creative knowledge work), and don't really test longer-term changes in semantic organization (mostly focus on immediate impact on learning, essays, etc.)

    - often very mixed results, see, e.g., [results]([[@chenInteractingHypertextMetaAnalysis1996]] super highly cited [[m/meta-analysis]], including [response from Shapiro](https://scite.ai/reports/promoting-active-learning-the-role-bbprD1?page=1) - basically says "idk, too noisy, but lots of extenunating factors, including student characteristics, task complexity, and basically we don't have a good handle on how to compare studies" - also, more effective but less efficient for hypertext vs. trad. (cc [[@kirshMultitaskingCostStructure2005]])) from this [[m/meta-analysis]] from [[@chenInteractingHypertextMetaAnalysis1996]]

    - notable exception of long-term followup (1y): [[@jacobsonDesignHypermediaTools2000]] - 1 year followup!!!!!

- with [[Cedric Chin]] for [[[[QUE]] - Can hypertext notetaking systems enhance cognitive flexibility?]]

    - note: map notes to [[Cedric Chin]]: map notes: this line of work is extraordinarily rich. last author (advisor/PI) is [[John D. Coley]], who's cited a lot in the piece, so it caught my attention as a program of research - i go to look up his google scholar profile and notice he's co-authored with [[Douglas Medin]] as equal (not in grad student position). amazing implications for cultural experiences (unstructured, in context) with cases to enhance conceptual flexibility, connects to deep roots in big shift in psych away from concepts as things with necessary and sufficient conditions, to family resemblances and contextual theories (like [[Wittgenstein]]!!! [[meaning as use]]!). super neat. i'm increasingly sensing a huge missed opportunity on the tools for thought side, ignoring this line of research as "just stodgy cognitive science" or "just about kids learning in schools"

    - added details to [[[[EVD]] - higher conceptual flexibility to classify organisms based on taxonomic and ecological relations if children were older, from more rural areas, and engaged in more unstructured interactions with organisms - [[@betzDevelopmentConceptualFlexibility2020]]]]

- for [[[[QUE]] - Can hypertext notetaking systems enhance cognitive flexibility?]], started [[February 18th, 2022]] | NOTE - this is not of a system, but of how diff. kinds of experience with the "examples/cases" (rural/unstructured, vs. urban/structured, like in aquariums and zoos) relates to tendency to organize by taxonomic vs. ecological relations, and ability to flexibly switch between them

    - they care about *conceptual flexibility* - ability to switch between taxonomic and ecological construals of living things

        - one axis: taxonomic vs. ecological construals

            - taxonomic = grouping living things based on shared morphological / intrinsic features, or common parents (is-a)

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FJCVpy0pW1y.png?alt=media&token=f8667c0e-5b37-43fa-b13e-6502443f8285) (p. 1)

            - ecological = thematic relations based on common habitat, function, interactions

            - this seems to be grounded here intuitively, rather than formally, though it roughly seems to map to [[entity categories]] (taxonomic) vs. [[relational categories]] (ecological) cc [[@gentnerRelationalCategories2005]], and reminds me of [[schema-driven analogizing]]: expert-novice stuff on how sources are selected, in particular "[[schema-driven analogizing]]" from experts (vs. case-driven from novices) [[@ballSpontaneousAnalogisingEngineering2004]]

    - dig into salience and availability - authors think this is really important - salience >> availability

        - what is salience?

            - preferred explanation from authors, which would be consistent with this idea of contextualizing, is "richer ecological experience" from rural children, which yields knowledge of ecological relations that are not perceptually obvious

    - oh weird, ppl used to think that thematic comes first (is easier, less "sophisticated), and then later taxonomic (more abstract). this seems like.... first-principles thinking as the main thing???
