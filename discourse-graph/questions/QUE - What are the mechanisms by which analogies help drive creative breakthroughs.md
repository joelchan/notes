    - Description

        - Analogies can help people come up with more (though not necessarily very novel) ideas [[@chanImpactAnalogiesCreative2015]([[observation-notes]]

        - Be careful though: need to navigate the fact that [[CLM - There is a 'Sweet Spot' in Analogical Distance. Somewhat far analogies lead to better creative outcomes than very near or very far analogies]]

        - Also note that there are multiple mechanisms

            - Direct, e.g., some relation or solution element in the source analog solves the currently open problem in an innovative way

                - The innovator has mapped relations between the source and target analogs

                    - Described as structural alignment by Gentnerâ€™s structure mapping engine ([SME]([[tmodelSME]]

                    - [MAC/FAC]([[tmodelMAC-FAC]]

                - Some mapped relation solves a currently open problem

                - Classic examples in [[@gickAnalogicalProblemSolving1980]]

                - This view of analogical inspiration draws on the existing literature on analogy and problem-solving, where analogies benefit problem-solving in domains such as math and insight problem-solving according to the following general process: a problem-solver faces some target problem for which he does not currently see a solution for, maps a source problem-with-solution to the target problem via analogy, and transfers and adapts the solution to the target problem (Gentner et al, 2009; Gick & Holyoak, 1983; Novick & Holyoak, 1991). There is little doubt that this is an important part of the story: much work has shown that this basic process can and does support innovation in design (Casakin & Goldschmidt, 1999; Dahl & Moreau, 2002; [Helms et al, 2007]([[@helmsCompoundAnalogicalDesign2008]]
