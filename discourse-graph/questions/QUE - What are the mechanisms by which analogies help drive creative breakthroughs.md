    - Description

        - Analogies can help people come up with more (though not necessarily very novel) ideas [[@chanImpactAnalogiesCreative2015](#[[observation-notes]] [[far analogies]] increased the teams concept generation rate compared to baseline conditions.)]

        - Be careful though: need to navigate the fact that [[[[CLM]] - There is a 'Sweet Spot' in Analogical Distance. Somewhat far analogies lead to better creative outcomes than very near or very far analogies]]

        - Also note that there are multiple mechanisms

            - Direct, e.g., some relation or solution element in the source analog solves the currently open problem in an innovative way

                - The innovator has mapped relations between the source and target analogs

                    - Described as structural alignment by Gentner‚Äôs structure mapping engine ([SME]([[tmodel/SME]]))

                    - [MAC/FAC]([[tmodel/MAC-FAC]]), [LISA]([[tmodel/LISA]]), and other models

                - Some mapped relation solves a currently open problem

                - Classic examples in [[@gickAnalogicalProblemSolving1980]] and [[@gickSchemaInductionAnalogical1983]]

                - This view of analogical inspiration draws on the existing literature on analogy and problem-solving, where analogies benefit problem-solving in domains such as math and insight problem-solving according to the following general process: a problem-solver faces some target problem for which he does not currently see a solution for, maps a source problem-with-solution to the target problem via analogy, and transfers and adapts the solution to the target problem (Gentner et al, 2009; Gick & Holyoak, 1983; Novick & Holyoak, 1991). There is little doubt that this is an important part of the story: much work has shown that this basic process can and does support innovation in design (Casakin & Goldschmidt, 1999; Dahl & Moreau, 2002; [Helms et al, 2007]([[@helmsCompoundAnalogicalDesign2008]]); Linsey et al, 2007, 2008; [Tseng et al, 2008]([[@tsengRoleTimingAnalogical2008]])). For instance, Linsey and colleagues (2007) showed how design students who had previously encountered an inflatable mattress product were able to spontaneously use this analogy to solve the problem of designing portable dumbbells. Also, Gero and colleagues (Gero & Kazakov, 1998; Kulinksi & Gero, 2001) have constructed computational simulations of direct transfer of solution concepts via analogy.

    - One thing I'm thinking about, still inspired by [[@vanrooijTheoryTestHow2021]] and [[@scheelWhyHypothesisTesters2020]] is to really dig into what the main concepts and [[explananda]] are here

        - In the past I've tended to use examples for exposition, with the "real meat" being the theory and experiments

        - But that's exactly backwards! The phenomena always need to be absolutely FRONT AND CENTER, driving the whole process from the get-go

        - In this case, I want to pay attention to subtle differences in mechanisms/patterns: direct borrowing of a solution (classical [[@gickAnalogicalProblemSolving1980]] style), flavor of [[bricolage]], probably easier lift, vs. more [indirect pathways of inspiration]([[[[CLM]] - A significant proportion of the benefits of analogical stimuli is oblique or indirect]])

[[Notes from Joel's PhD about analogy]]

- What do we currently know about what is happening cognitively when a designer is inspired by an analogy (or set of analogies) and produces an innovative design? --> [[[[QUE]] - How does analogy actually happen in the process of scholarly/scientific innovation?]] [[[[QUE]] - What are the mechanisms by which analogies help drive creative breakthroughs?]]

    - The designer has accessed or retrieved some cue from either the environment or memory, and some kind of analogy process is happening

        - Could have a direct benefit ‚Äì e.g., some relation or solution element in the source analog solves the currently open problem in an innovative way

            - The designer has mapped relations between the source and target analogs

                - Described as structural alignment by Gentner‚Äôs structure mapping engine ([SME]([[tmodel/SME]]))

                - [MAC/FAC]([[tmodel/MAC-FAC]]), [LISA]([[tmodel/LISA]]), and other models

            - Some mapped relation solves a currently open problem

        - Could be an indirect benefit

            - The deep structure route. The analog acts as a memory cue, such as we might observe an expert designer ‚Äújumping‚Äù from one analog straight to another far-field analog via some ‚Äúdeep structure‚Äù connection (Blanchette & Dunbar, 2000). I need to read up more on this to kee

            - The ‚Äúinsight‚Äù route. The analog is so far-field that thinking about it [restructures]([[problem (re)formulation]]) the problem representation in such a way that access to a relevant analog or creative idea becomes now ‚Äúopen‚Äù, e.g., through relaxing of constraints or [chunk decompositions]([[chunk decomposition]]) ([Knoblich et al, 1999]([[@knoblichConstraintRelaxationChunk1999]]))  Broad question: is this restructuring random or is it systematic in some describable way? Any more specific questions at this point? We are still processing this idea.

            - The perceptual cue route?? Just throwing this out there ‚Äì maybe a special feature of design or visually intensive creative domains? This goes back to Kate‚Äôs question of whether geometry can imply functionality. Some clues along this path can be found in some work by Nerssessian and other work in perceptual simulation (see, e.g., Catrambone, Craig, & Nersessian, 2006; Craig, Nersessian, & Catrambone, 2002), which suggests that there are ways that you can represent information, even with lots of superficial detail, that confer advantages in terms of facilitating activation of a relevant image schema (Mandler, 1992), which can bring up relevant knowledge of functional principles that can help solve the problem
