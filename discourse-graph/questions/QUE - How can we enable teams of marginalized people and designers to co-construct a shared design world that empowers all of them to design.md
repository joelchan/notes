    - Key theoretical concepts for thinking about [[remote work]]:

        - common ground

        - coupling of work

        - collaboration readiness

        - collaboration technology readiness

    - Diff varieties of limits to replicating the richness and efficacy of [[information-rich, face-to-face communication]]:

        - **Pragmatic** limits (can't do it __yet__)

        - **Logical** limits (can't do it __in principle__) (this is the more important fundamental contribution and claim of the paper)

            - This is similar to what [[@ackermanIntellectualChallengeCSCW2000]] argues, though on a different (perhaps broader) lens on social computing

            - > Our findings in these settings fall into two categories: behavior that will change for the better when the technology achieves certain qualities we think are possible in the next 20 years, and behavior that will never change. It is this second category we expand in the third part of the article, exploring why distance will continue to matter even with significant technological advances. (p. 141)

            - #[[QUE]]: What does it take to establish a "limits" argument?

    - Scope

        - Note: "we compare collocated work with remote work as it is possible ^^today^^ and comment on the promise of remote work tomorrow" (p. 139) - this was in [[2000]]!

        - Focus on synchronous interactions (ignore asynchronous for now) (p. 141)

        - Settings considered (p. 142-144)

            - Collocated = can get to workspace within 30m walk (p. 142), have shared space to be in together, and shared stuff to look at together

            - Distance "now": telephony, meeting room video conferencing, chat rooms, file transfer, application sharing, even VR!

                - Concrete example: "

                - Caterpillar used Virtual Reality Cave technology from National Center for Supercomputing Applications to do real-time design sessions between"

                - Europe and North America (Lehner & DeFanti, 1997).

            - Distance "in the future": ++ design, ++ computing power, ++ bandwidth, ++ VR

    - My questions:

        - #[[QUE]]: What does it take to establish a "limits" argument?

    - Side notes:

        - > It is well known that any delay greater than 500 msec will severely disrupt conversational flow (Krauss & Bricker, 1967; Riez & Klemmer, 1963).

            - There was that later thing on Zoom and synchrony....

    - Are the workarounds (de-coupling, adding formal protocols, pp. 152-153) similar to [[@ackermanIntellectualChallengeCSCW2000]]'s notion of first-order approximations?

    - The first two concepts seem like the most fundamental; the latter two (collaboration and tech readiness) more malleable

    - OK high level

        - Types of evidence they are drawing from: lab studies, but also field studies, including software design teams, global teams, distributed science teams

        - Claims

            - Degree of required/pre-existing common ground and task coupling independently and jointly determine whether remote work succeeds

                - Corollary: in remote work, people will tend to change the nature of the process/work to reduce demands for common ground and task coupling (e.g., making the task/process more structured, loosening the coupling)

            - People tend to change to accommodate bad tech rather than change the bad tech

            - Remote work will likely required adoption of new tech, easier if tech readiness is high

            - Limitations of tech wrt common ground and coupling can be overcome with interleaved practice emerging over time alongside the tool

        - Concepts:

            - Common ground

                - The bit about common ground connects most to [[@waltherComputerMediatedCommunicationImpersonal1996]]

            - Trust

            - Culture

            - Power distance

            - Coupling

            - Incentives

    - methods

        - modified [[difference in difference analysis]]

            - diff between:

                - remote before, remote now

                - not remote before, remote now

            - both subject to exogenous shock of covid-related WFH policy

            - matching with [[coarsened exact matching (CEM)]] based on role, managerial status, seniority level, and tenure at the company

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FtEsSV_MivN.png?alt=media&token=745aaed4-f874-4ca9-a3b1-05553de817cd)

                - note: also did more exhaustive matching based on time-varying behavioral attributes that were the main outcome measures (e.g., weak ties, email use, unscheduled calls, etc.) - model had similar results

        - [[telemetry]]

    - headline

        - less weak ties, more leaning into strong ties

            - very much reminiscent of what [[@olsonDistanceMatters2000]] predicted and saw in prior field studies: when remote, people adapt/accommodate by decreasing need for coupling and common ground (if remote tech makes it hard to do those) - this sort of suggests we still don't do this well at all

                - though the exogenous shock also includes a bunch of other stuff like disruptions and a LITERAL PANDEMIC!!

        - move towards async, more unscheduled calls

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FRlYyfsK6B0.png?alt=media&token=7c698206-2669-4e46-9c01-ddc53e1bdfb8)

- from pilot study for [[[[QUE]] - How can we enable teams of marginalized people and designers to co-construct a shared design world that empowers all of them to design?]] [[idea: CollageCollab]]

    - unexpected issues familiarity with google drive and google slides (esp. the importing from drive)

        - try next: create a "bank"

    - came up with really fun ideas!

    - uploaded text and images; option for audio and video, but no one did it

    - initial instructions about finding thigns that represent your everyday life were a bit confusing
