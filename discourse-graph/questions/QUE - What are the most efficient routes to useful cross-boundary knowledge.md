- # Synthesis

    - Hypothesis: we have far better evidence of **people** being the initial / most important first entry points into ideas across disciplinary (and other) boundaries, compared to search or recommendation that is separated from a social interaction of some kind. This is a variant of [[[[CLM]] - In interdisciplinary domains, network-based foraging is more powerful than search-based foraging]]

    - We have lots of evidence of people being an effective (and in many cases the most preferred) channel to cross-boundary information

        - In describing how scientists at an interdisciplinary center imported information from outside their specialty, [[@palmerWorkBoundariesScience2001]] identified a range of practices, from talking to personal contacts, reading literature, and engaging in more formal learning activities. A strong theme was the special efficiency and effectiveness of talking to people to access and filter cross-boundary information with maximal signal-to-noise ratio.

            - For example, Palmer writes, "no other type of information interaction is likely to be [as] efficient and profitable [as interactive discussions with colleagues]" (p. 33-34)

            - She also summarized that scientists at the interdisciplinary research center imported information across disciplinary boundaries predominantly via **personal networks** (pp. 31, 32-35). For example, ((YRq-AQNqf))

        - There is also research on sources of innovation in innovation contests and firm-/organizational-level innovation that suggests an [[outsider innovation]] phenomenon: breakthrough innovations are more likely to come from people who are technically marginal/distant from the problem domain

            - For example, [[@jeppesenMarginalityProblemsolvingEffectiveness2010]] found that [Solvers](((8JunxBU6A))) who chose to submit their solutions to the 2nd stage of an innovation contest and [self-rated themselves as more technically distant from the problem domain](((LtwnesPYh))) were slightly more likely to submit winning solutions for [Innocentive science problem solving contests](((OztGD5jl4)))

        - Additional indirect evidence comes from the literature on collocation and collaboration, which so far we can see generally seems to find facilitative effects on knowledge transfer and collaboration from induced face-to-face contact [[[[CLM]] - Physical proximity greatly facilitates initiation of new collaborations]]

            - An entry point is [[@cataliniMicrogeographyDirectionInventive2017]], who found substantial changes in the likelihood of collaboration [across research labs](setting: major research university in France) as a function of [collocation](((5o6r4gVo9))), particularly for labs that were "[further apart](((WduBJ9Zfy)))" in research areas.

                - This work *suggests* / is consistent with the idea that other channels of search across boundaries are less efficient than face-to-face (presumably "small touch", bc collocation) contact with people from other units (i.e., across boundaries). the logic is that if the [search costs]([[search costs of innovation]]) were the same / comparable, then those ideas would have initiation probability that is similar to collocation, in the absence of collocation.

            - Similarly, [[@boudreauFieldExperimentSearch2017]] found that The likelihood that any given pair of [scientists](((ni7gqlsHZ))) who were [assigned](((3EdxejW1j))) to the [same breakout room](((c_73yT22R))) to discuss their work would collaborate on a [pilot grant proposal](((luxOWrHJ_))) was [estimated](((J6rkdI6pn))) to be substantially (~75%) [higher](((gA4onRafb))) ($$p(collaborate) ~= .28$$) compared to scientist pairs who were assigned to different rooms ($$p(collaborate) ~= .16$$). This estimated effect was statistically significant at p < .10.

                - Note, however: this effect seems to be driven by [facilitating scientist pairs who are from the same clinical area to collaborate](The [estimated increased likelihood of collaboration](((WqhZS9HHR))) from being randomly assigned to be in the same breakout room dropped to basically zero when they added an interaction term between being in the same room and whether pairs of scientists were from the same clinical area; this interaction term was [statistically significant](((jvGl0gqAS))) at p < .10), which suggests there might still be [important inefficiencies](((J4R-1bnk-))) to accessing and using cross-boundary knowledge, even when you get initial access to it through a person.

    - We lack evidence that literature discovery tools that don't involve tight integration with at least one person can actually help people cross knowledge boundaries

    - Why might people be especially efficient access points to cross-boundary information?

        - One explanation might be that [[[[CLM]] - Substantial portions of knowledge that is critical for innovation are not written down]], and are instead "in the heads" of people.

            - This is partially because [[[[CLM]] - Knowledge is fundamentally contextual]]. It is partially on this basis that [[[[CLM]] - CSCW research on knowledge sharing shifted from a repository model to an expertise sharing model around the mid-2000's - [[@ackermanSharingKnowledgeExpertise2013]]]]

        - Another related explanation could be [the oblique nature of analogical inspiration]([[[[CLM]] - A significant proportion of the benefits of analogical stimuli is oblique or indirect]]): rather than an idea or a phrase or picture being "the idea" that you transfer, it may be more accurate to conceptualize a stimulus, such as an [analogous paper]([[analogy]]) as a point/component/spark in a process of inspiration that may lead to a good idea via adapting a direct solution, but also potentially via other routes, such as sparking [[problem (re)formulation]].

            - This, combined with the previous point, may mean that encountering a paper from a different domain, no matter how relevant, may be inert in itself, if it isn't connected to a rich process of inspiration (e.g., reformulation, query)

    - Note that there are still some inefficiencies for the people route

        - For example, [[@laneEngineeringSerendipityWhen]] reported that scientist pairs who were [randomly assigned to talk to each other](((Dvg9ncop6))) (and did so, face-to-face) at an [interdisciplinary medical imaging symposium](((HvQgkhAIF))) used about 6 new [MeSH keywords from their partners in future publications](((08vh79BF1))) when the pair had [moderate overlap in intellectual interests](((_eEx8ZIIv))), compared to low or high overlap (for which there were no clear effects)

            - It's notable that the observed positive effects here were for estimated [less than 20% of the scientist pairs](note: only 2% of the pairs fell into the "partial overlap" category for field similarity, and the majority of scientists (about 80%) had "low intellectual similarity" (i.e., ~2 common keywords or fewer))!

            - And in some cases (e.g., when field similarity was high), there were [*dampening* effects on co-authorship in the 6 years following the symposium](scientist pairs who were [randomly assigned to talk to each other](((Dvg9ncop6))) (and did so, face-to face) at an [interdisciplinary medical imaging symposium](((HvQgkhAIF))) had *fewer* [co-authored publications with their partner after the symposium](((Dxba0prqe))) when the pair had [high field similarity](((_eEx8ZIIv))), compared to low or moderate overlap (for which there were no clear effects; maybe a slightly positive effect for moderately field-similar pairs, but the 95% confidence interval crosses zero)).

            - #appraisal - these results seem a bit fragile to me: they rest on interaction terms in relatively complex OLS models.

            - Caveats aside, this result suggests that the likelihood that a randomly paired interaction, even within a relatively shared [community of interest]([[communities of interest]]), and estimating effects on  a relatively "lightweight" outcome (i.e., evidence of [knowledge transfer](**knowledge sharing**, measured in part from random assignments, and in part from face to face interaction data from sociometric badges), instead of more costly endpoints like copublication), is probably less than a coin flip!

        - These results raises the question: [[[[QUE]] - What is the range of expected "benefits" of engineered interactions with potential "informants" across knowledge boundaries?]]

- Add [[@ferrissDrMartineRothblatt]] Title: Dr. Martine Rothblatt — A Masterclass on Asking Better Questions and Peering Into the Future (#487) to queue - chock-full of inspiration for [[idea: sociotechnical analogical connector]] / [[[[QUE]] - What are the most efficient routes to useful cross-boundary knowledge?]]

    - Listening especially to this: How did Martine start a biotechnology company to save the life of one of her daughters in spite of only having taken biology in high school? What did it take to even comprehend the scope of such an endeavor, and what was the journey that made it a reality? [15:33]

        - Observations:

            - Very strong motivation to search: "experts" (doctors) said [there was no solution](**Martine Rothblatt: **Sure. So it’s kind of funny that you can go all the way through undergraduate at a great place like UCLA and never be required to take a life science course, but that was the case. So the last biology class I had was in high school and here suddenly I was faced with a situation as an adult while running SiriusXM, that our youngest daughter is diagnosed with a fatal illness. She can’t even walk up a couple of stairs to the front door and there are no medicines approved for it. I finally got her to the best doctor one could find, the Head of Pediatric Cardiology at Children’s National Medical Center in the middle of Washington DC. And the doctor said, “This is an extremely rare disease. No one knows why it arises. All the patients die within two to three years.” He had only seen two or three other kids with it and they both died. “And all you can do is hope for a lung transplant.”) for her dying daughter

                - This reminds me of the timing stuff: [[@tsengRoleTimingAnalogical2008]], and [[@siangliulueProvidingTimelyExamples2015]], among others:

                    - Under what starting conditions would people even be motivated to try to process analogies?

                        - That's the first ingredient, I think

                        - If this isn't present, then it's possible no amount of design of the matching or interaction will really help

                    - in [[@laneEngineeringSerendipityWhen]], the motivator is applying for grants

                    - keep this motivation in mind

            - Had to [integrate lots of background knowledge through dictionaries and high-school/college-level textbooks](Most of the time I read things, I didn’t understand what they were talking about because there were these long medical words and chemical words that I never learned in law school, or we never had to deal with in electrical engineering. But of course, there were dictionaries, and I looked up the words in the dictionary and they had college-level anatomy textbooks. So what I didn’t know, I just kept going backwards in academia, I guess you would say, backwards in learning or pedagogia, until I would even get to like a high school level textbook that would explain something. And I said, “Okay, I get that.” And I kept taking notes and just educated myself night after night until I learned everything I needed to know.) - reminds me of what we've been seeing with [[WP: BARCode]] and [[WP: Augmenting scientific creativity with analogical inspirations]]: the barrier of background knowledge stopping you from being able to see if there's something there. Here, Martine is strongly motivated to not miss anything.

                - I really wonder what her notes look like!!

            - Used [[shepardizing]] to [navigate the literature](**Martine Rothblatt: **Sure, Tim. So there are a good zillion articles published on every type of medical research you could imagine. I mean, it’s just a bottomless well. There are literally hundreds of different types of medical journals. And each of those journals have every year thousands of articles published across them. So it’s difficult to find the information that you need, but in law school, we learn a very useful skill. And this skill goes by the name of Shepardizing after this type of index they have in law school called Shepard’s. So what Shepardizing involves is when a judge writes a decision like the Supreme Court issues a decision, they drop a lot of footnotes. And of course, one thing lawyers love to do is make footnotes and references. And then what you’re supposed to do as a good lawyer is to look up all of the footnotes and the references that that Supreme Court or lower court case referred to. And then the Shepardizing process is after you get all of those references to then look up all of the references in those other articles. And ultimately, you get to a point of diminishing returns where three, four, five levels down, the references are all circling back around on themselves.). Notice that she didn't mention "search" in the regular sense. Very very network-based, to not only find things, but also filter (which ones are most worth reading?)

            - Finally got to a [paper that described a promising molecule](So I applied that Shepardizing process to these medical articles, and somewhat like doctors, whenever a researcher publishes an article, they make footnotes and citations to other people’s research who they relied upon. So I would get all of those articles and read those. And then I would follow up on all of the references in those. Finally, I read about a molecule that a researcher at Glaxo Wellcome had written in which they described testing this molecule for congestive heart failure. And it failed in its test of congestive heart failure. It did not work, but in the article, they had charts of what the molecule did. And ^^the one thing that the molecule did that grabbed my attention was that it reduced the pressure between the lung and the heart, which is called the pulmonary artery. It reduced the pulmonary artery pressure while leaving the pressures and all of the rest of the body perfectly fine. Well, that’s exactly the problem with pulmonary arterial hypertension^^, the people who have this disease — oh, I’ll make a quick footnote.):

                - notice that she [had the background knowledge](Now, when my daughter was diagnosed, 2,000 people in the US had the disease. Because medicines have become so much better, and because we’ve been able to have, like you mentioned in the introduction, get all of these approvals, there are now 50,000 people in America alone living with it. So it’s likely that people listening to your podcast will know somebody or another who has pulmonary arterial hypertension. And I read this article and I said, “Wow, just what I need. This tiny stretch of artery chest between the heart and the lungs, this molecule somehow talks to that tiny stretch of artery and leaves the whole rest of the body alone.” That was the holy grail that I was looking for. So I looked at where the author of the article was from, he was from Glaxo Wellcome in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. And I made a beeline down to him and asked him if he could develop this molecule that he’d found for my daughter’s disease.) to immediately recognize the significance of what she was seeing! The mapping here is deeply structural: the emphasis is on the *effect* of "reducing pressure between the lung and the heart while leaving all other pressures unchanged" - which turns out to be exactly the "problem" with pulmonary arterial hypertension!

        - Next: What were the three incorrect assumptions pharmaceutical company Glaxo Wellcome made in not pursuing production of the drug from which Martine’s company has since made billions of dollars? [27:12]

            - Notice especially the prior here (need lots of detailed [[synthesis]] and understanding to overcome), that is mostly correct, that [any given molecule is highly unlikely to be therapeutically useful](**Martine Rothblatt: **I think there were probably like maybe three main ones. The first one, and I can say this kind of from firsthand knowledge, since I am now the head of a pharmaceutical company, the odds of any molecule actually working in the human body are less than one in a hundred. I mean, the human body is so complicated. It’s like a massive set of very precisely keyed locks. And every molecule is like a random key. And the chance that you would have a molecule that opened the lock that fixed some dysfunction in the body rather than causing some harm to the body is, it’s less than one in a hundred. So first of all, they figured the chance of this thing working just, in general, was less than one in a hundred. Secondly, they thought to themselves, “Even if it worked a little bit, there’s only 2,000 people in the whole country with this disease.” They didn’t really think that if it worked really well, the number of people would keep cumulating.)

            - nice #example-of [[analogy]] (but a partial insight, not the whole: influenced the [[problem (re)formulation]] by challenging a fundamental assumption that the "market" for a drug is fixed): she [applied the idea of a "subscriber mindset"](**Martine Rothblatt: **Exactly. I thought about it like I was getting subscribers at SiriusXM. People said to me, “Oh, Martine, you’ll be lucky to have a hundred thousand subscribers.” I said, “Well, if I keep them and I get another a hundred thousand the next year, then I’ll be up to 200,000 and then maybe 400,000 and 800,000.” Now we have 30 million. So they didn’t think in that subscriber mindset. That was their second problem.) from her experience inventing and growing [[Sirius XM]]

        - Relevant to [[idea: sociotechnical analogical connector]] and a powerful #example-of [[outsider innovation]]

        - Martine used [[shepardizing]] to zero in on a promising molecule, then formed a biotech company ([United Therapeutics](https://www.unither.com/index.html)) to buy the molecule, and develop a drug (I believe it's [Remodulin](https://www.remodulin.com/pulmonary-arterial-hypertension-treatment/our-story/), per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Therapeutics#cite_note-FDA_2002-9))

    - Another example: What is the vagus nerve, and how is United Therapeutics attempting to manipulate it for the purpose of therapy in conditions such as Crohn’s disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and rheumatoid arthritis? How do recent discoveries in this area of research lend credibility to ancient therapies like acupuncture? [59:07]

        - Here we have a concrete #example-of encountering a bridging [[analogy]], but also in conjunction with people, cc [[[[QUE]] - What are the most efficient routes to useful cross-boundary knowledge?]]

            - She [encounters a phrase on the cover of Scientific American](**Martine Rothblatt: **Subscribe to __Scientific American__. I’m sorry to put an advertisement in here, but I find __Scientific American__ and __National Geographic__ to have like the greatest ways for laypeople, which I do consider myself a layperson, to learn about all different types of science that they might not know anything about. So, one day, I got my __Scientific American__ in the mail, and on the cover, it was “Using Electronics to Cure Diseases.” Well, here I am, like my whole career has just been like electronic engineering, building satellites, and now, because of my daughter, I’m in this medical field. So, I’m like so excited. It was one of those lightning bolts to the soul. Now, I have a chance to bring my male and female side together, to bring my satellite and my biology side together and merge them.): "using electronics to cure diseases". She's primed to be excited about hte potential of hte idea because of her background in EE and satellites with Sirius XM, and her work with pulmonary hypertension for her daughter

            - She then [developed a relationship with the right person to talk to to develop this idea](So I got very excited, and I had the chance to meet and now work with and support the work of Dr. Tracey. He taught me a very simple sentence, Tim, which I’ve subsequently found to be absolutely true in all the research I’ve read. It is that the nervous system touches every single cell in your body. The nervous system touches every single cell in our body. The largest nerve in the body, there’s one nerve that is way, way larger than all the rest of them, it’s the vagus nerve. It starts in our mind. It wraps around our heart, our lungs, our gut. It’s an immense nerve.): Kevin Tracey, basically the "father of bioelectronic medicine", and now exploring vagal stimulation therapy

            - The evidence base is limited within mainstream Western medical research, but there is a way to do [[synthesis]], bringing in ["trial and error" evidence from thousands of years of Chinese acupuncture practice](**Martine Rothblatt: **Yeah. It is totally true, and why really would it not be true? I mean, thousands of years of Chinese civilization, they have had a chance to do so much trial and error, and they were a literate civilization for so long, so the results of that trial and error could be passed on and passed on. So, I do think it’s entirely rational that they would have figured this out, and what I’m hoping for now and what I’m trying to support is there is an opportunity to what I call in my own words, crack the human neurome. So, what that means, that there are a unique pattern of amplitudes and signal lanes and signal voltages that will activate some different part of the vagus nerve than others. Each of these different voltages and wavelengths will correlate to a different part of the human body. We don’t know what those are.): [primed from theory of the vagus nerve to recognize](((en-O7VbVu))) the potential sources of therapeutic effects of acupuncture, since they happen to target the key spots that would also stimulate the therapeutic effects of the vagus nerve

                - This reminds me of how Isaac Newton had expressed high skepticism that solutions for the longitude problem could come from outside of astronomic science, in response to multiple failures of proposals from outside astronomy [[@cattaniDeconstructingOutsiderPuzzle2017]]

            - this gets at the point that literature on its own would be far from sufficient, perhaps especially in the case of [[interdisciplinarity]], because people writing for a disciplinary audience will probably assume their audience knows things you don't, and consequently leave them out from what is actually written down

    - Key theoretical concepts for thinking about [[remote work]]:

        - common ground

        - coupling of work

        - collaboration readiness

        - collaboration technology readiness

    - Diff varieties of limits to replicating the richness and efficacy of [[information-rich, face-to-face communication]]:

        - **Pragmatic** limits (can't do it __yet__)

        - **Logical** limits (can't do it __in principle__) (this is the more important fundamental contribution and claim of the paper)

            - This is similar to what [[@ackermanIntellectualChallengeCSCW2000]] argues, though on a different (perhaps broader) lens on social computing

            - > Our findings in these settings fall into two categories: behavior that will change for the better when the technology achieves certain qualities we think are possible in the next 20 years, and behavior that will never change. It is this second category we expand in the third part of the article, exploring why distance will continue to matter even with significant technological advances. (p. 141)

            - #[[QUE]]: What does it take to establish a "limits" argument?

    - Scope

        - Note: "we compare collocated work with remote work as it is possible ^^today^^ and comment on the promise of remote work tomorrow" (p. 139) - this was in [[2000]]!

        - Focus on synchronous interactions (ignore asynchronous for now) (p. 141)

        - Settings considered (p. 142-144)

            - Collocated = can get to workspace within 30m walk (p. 142), have shared space to be in together, and shared stuff to look at together

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2Fcj_o4Oiqwx.png?alt=media&token=fb334ef1-6fb3-4fd1-a499-d317c15d593d) (p. 147)

            - Distance "now": telephony, meeting room video conferencing, chat rooms, file transfer, application sharing, even VR!

                - Concrete example: "

                - Caterpillar used Virtual Reality Cave technology from National Center for Supercomputing Applications to do real-time design sessions between"

                - Europe and North America (Lehner & DeFanti, 1997).

            - Distance "in the future": ++ design, ++ computing power, ++ bandwidth, ++ VR

    - My questions:

        - #[[QUE]]: What does it take to establish a "limits" argument?

    - Side notes:

        - > It is well known that any delay greater than 500 msec will severely disrupt conversational flow (Krauss & Bricker, 1967; Riez & Klemmer, 1963).

            - There was that later thing on Zoom and synchrony....

    - Are the workarounds (de-coupling, adding formal protocols, pp. 152-153) similar to [[@ackermanIntellectualChallengeCSCW2000]]'s notion of first-order approximations?

    - The first two concepts seem like the most fundamental; the latter two (collaboration and tech readiness) more malleable

    - OK high level

        - Types of evidence they are drawing from: lab studies, but also field studies, including software design teams, global teams, distributed science teams

        - Claims

            - Degree of required/pre-existing common ground and task coupling independently and jointly determine whether remote work succeeds

                - Corollary: in remote work, people will tend to change the nature of the process/work to reduce demands for common ground and task coupling (e.g., making the task/process more structured, loosening the coupling)

            - People tend to change to accommodate bad tech rather than change the bad tech

            - Remote work will likely required adoption of new tech, easier if tech readiness is high

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FcVgpuq-2dY.png?alt=media&token=e786bf55-d14d-4b01-bbad-6a5a578b8492) (p. 156)

            - Limitations of tech wrt common ground and coupling can be overcome with interleaved practice emerging over time alongside the tool

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FAe4U1ch15L.png?alt=media&token=0e3080e7-0140-4263-91fb-51c4cb070200) (p. 156)

        - Concepts:

            - Common ground

                - The bit about common ground connects most to [[@waltherComputerMediatedCommunicationImpersonal1996]]

            - Trust

- These findings are relevant for understanding [[[[QUE]] - What are the most efficient routes to useful cross-boundary knowledge?]], in the sense that efficiency is extremely important, because the costs are so high for navigating and assessing information across boundaries (which tend to be high [[Scatter]])

    - [[@packerImportanceSDICurrent1979]] in particular is instructive as a cautionary tale that a decontextualized recommender service can really help in boundary-crossing / [navigating]([[[[CLM]] - Interdisciplinary synthesis is hard because of scatter in the literature]]) high-[[Scatter]] / [[interdisciplinarity]]

                - Found this good paper comparing offline, online, and user study data

                    - Really low absolute performance (in the single digits at best)

                    - Thoughtful criticisms of offline datasets in light of [[[[CLM]] - Citation practices in science are far from optimal]] and other criticisms

                - This paper quantifies the balance of eval methods: ~70% of approaches as of [[2013]] were with offline eval, 34% had a user study (only 10% in a detailed usage setting) - should prioritize looking up those papers to triangulate against [[@packerImportanceSDICurrent1979]]

    - #theory We lack evidence that literature discovery tools that don't involve tight integration with at least one person can actually help people cross knowledge boundaries

        - Going to be a bit more loose here, but I'm going to start with a provocative statement that I'm not 100% sure I believe just yet.

        - I think there are a few components to this.

            - It's really tough to find direct tests of the efficacy of literature discovery tools that are directly about spanning/crossing knowledge boundaries across fields

            - The theoretical prognosis is not necessarily encouraging (e.g., the [general shift in knowledge management away from repositories to expert-finding]([[[[CLM]] - CSCW research on knowledge sharing shifted from a repository model to an expertise sharing model around the mid-2000's - [[@ackermanSharingKnowledgeExpertise2013]]]])), but that can be a question for another time

            - And at the end of the day, the metric of success is also crucial to consider.

                - {{embed: Back to [[Q: What do we know about the real-world efficacy of literature discovery tools?]], thinking about metrics....}}

            - We lack robust evidence of the real-world efficacy of literature discovery tools **in general** (ignoring whether we're talking about within or across knowledge boundaries).

                - So basically absence of evidence.

                - For instance, [[@beelResearchPaperRecommender2013]] reported that the majority of a [sample of 70 recommendation approaches](((-9iTZhMJF))) as of [[2013]] were [evaluated](((fWZDjZut-))) with offline approaches (~70%) and user studies (~30%): a small minority had been evaluated in realistic deployments in online evaluations (N=5,  ~7% of the sample) and qualitative user studies (N=2)

                - Studies of [[literature-based discovery]] also seem to be [mostly "offline" evals](The lit seems to have similar problems in evaluation methods (bias towards biased "offline" evaluations, trying to reproduce a small set of past discoveries)), trying to reproduce past discoveries [[@sebastianEmergingApproachesLiteraturebased2017]]

                            - The evaluation of recommender systems is key to the successful application of recommender systems in

                            - practice. To evaluate recommender systems, there are three evaluation methods: offline evaluations, online

                            - evaluations, and user studies. In this paper, we examine and discuss the appropriateness of the three

                            - methods. Among others, we use the three methods to evaluate a number of recommendations approaches in

                            - the field of research paper recommendations. The evaluations show that results from offline evaluations

                            - sometimes contradict results from online evaluations and user studies. We discuss potential reasons for this,

                            - namely the impact of human factors, the potential inherent value of offline evaluations, and the imperfection

                            - of offline-datasets, and we conclude that offline evaluations probably are not suitable to evaluate

                            - recommender systems, particularly in the domain of research paper recommender systems. We further

                            - analyze and discuss the appropriateness of some online evaluation metrics such as click-through rate, link-

                            - through rate, and cite-through rate. We conclude that click-through is the most favorable metric, at least in

                            - our research, since metrics such as cite-through rate did correlate less well with user satisfaction than click-

                            - undefined

        - There is scant evidence of the actual real-world efficacy of systems --- such as search engines and content-based recommender systems ((collaborative filteirng based on realistic usage in a social network might be an edge case here)) --- that provide access to knowledge across boundaries in the absence of people

            - One issue is the lack of direct tests of real-world efficacy

                - What we want is longitudinal, rich data that we can use to trace from literature discovery through to actual impact. These are rare gems! We really need to find them

                - For example, most evaluations of "literature discovery" tools rely on intrinsic/offline evaluations (e.g., predicting citations that were in a paper, or pre-built datasets) or small-scale evaluations

                    - This includes our work! [[@chanSOLVENTMixedInitiative2018]] included a case study. Our in-progress work [[WP: Augmenting scientific creativity with analogical inspirations]] goes a bit further, asking participants to generate ideas and actually try to use the recommendations, but we weren't able to follow them down the path to observe actual impacts.

                    - [[@beelResearchPaperRecommender2013]] reported that the majority of a [sample of 70 recommendation approaches](((-9iTZhMJF))) as of [[2013]] were [evaluated](((fWZDjZut-))) with offline approaches (~70%) and user studies (~30%): a small minority had been evaluated in realistic deployments in online evaluations (N=5,  ~7% of the sample) and qualitative user studies (N=2)

Docear is an academic literature suite to search, organize, and create research articles. The users' data (papers, references, annotations, etc.) is managed in mind maps and these mind maps are utilized for the recommendations. Using content-based filtering methods, Docear's recommender achieves click-through rates around 6%, in some scenarios even over 10%.

We test three different collaborative filtering algorithms, and find that user-based filtering performs best. A temporal analysis of the data indexed by CiteULike shows that it takes about two years for the cold-start problem to disappear and recommendation performance to improve.

                                    - We explore a novel ontological approach to user profiling within recommender systems, working on the problem of recommending on-line academic research papers. Our two experimental systems, Quickstep and Foxtrot, create user profiles from unobtrusively monitored behaviour and relevance feedback, representing the profiles in terms of a research paper topic ontology. A novel profile visualization approach is taken to acquire profile feedback. Research papers are classified using ontological classes and collaborative recommendation algorithms used to recommend papers seen by similar people on their current topics of interest. Two small-scale experiments, with 24 subjects over 3 months, and a large-scale experiment, with 260 subjects over an academic year, are conducted to evaluate different aspects of our approach. Ontological inference is shown to improve user profiling, external ontological knowledge used to successfully bootstrap a recommender system and profile visualization employed to improve profiling accuracy. The overall performance of our ontological recommender systems are also presented and favourably compared to other systems in the literature.

                                    - Although recording of usage data is common in scholarly information services, its exploitation for the creation of value-added services remains limited due to concerns regarding, among others, user privacy, data validity, and the lack of accepted standards for the representation, sharing and aggregation of usage data. This paper presents a technical, standards-based architecture for sharing usage information, which we have designed and implemented. In this architecture, OpenURL-compliant linking servers aggregate usage information of a specific user community as it navigates the distributed information environment that it has access to. This usage information is made OAI-PMH harvestable so that usage information exposed by many linking servers can be aggregated to facilitate the creation of value-added services with a reach beyond that of a single community or a single information service. This paper also discusses issues that were encountered when implementing the proposed approach, and it presents preliminary results obtained from analyzing a usage data set containing about 3,500,000 requests aggregated by a federation of linking servers at the California State University system over a 20 month period

                                    - Current approaches to the discovery of scientific resources (publications, data sets and web services) are dominated by keyword search. These approaches do not allow scientists to search on the deeper semantics of scientific resources, or to discover resources on the basis of the scientific approaches taken. This article evaluates a user interface that allows users to discover scientific resources through structured knowledge in the form of ontologies describing the domain and the scientific knowledge inherent within the scientific resource, and also through informal user tags. These combined capabilities provide scientists with new and powerful options for resource discovery. A qualitative user evaluation explored how scientists felt about the approach for resource discovery in the context of their scientific work. The study showed that marine scientists were enthusiastic about the capabilities of such an approach and appreciated the ability to browse the visual structure of the knowledge and query on scientific method but, overall, preferred the use of tags over ontologies. The exploratory nature of the user study was used to identify future directions for such improvements.

                                    - The COastal and Marine Perception Application for Scientific Scholarship (COMPASS) is a knowledge infrastructure that supports enhanced discovery of scientific resources, including publications, data sets and web services. It provides users with the ability to discover resources on the basis of domain knowledge using ontologies, and scientific knowledge, including the scientific models, theories and methods that were used to conduct the research described by the resource. The application includes an architecture that adopts standards from the geospatial information community to ensure interoperability between repositories and allow interaction with content from digital libraries. The architecture shows how ontologies can be used as a registry for an interoperable infrastructure. A prototype was successfully implemented and evaluated with users, finding enthusiasm and support for the approach, with some suggestions for improvements of the prototype implementation.

                        - both of these studies are "reaction-based" evals, not necessarily in real usage, but we can see if there's deeper analysis of the reactions and how this might fit

            - edit: quick skim after adding, feeling a little *more* depressed actually - i haven't seen any really strong studies that stood out that could give real deep insight into real-world efficacy... :(

- #writingsession to integrate new stuff from [[Xin Qian]] for [[[[QUE]] - What are the most efficient routes to useful cross-boundary knowledge?]]

    - New stuff to integrate:

        - {{embed: From [[@cataliniMicrogeographyDirectionInventive2017]]: Lab pairs bring novel ideas to **domain-specific** research agendas  }}

            - [[Joel Chan]]: right, this work *suggests* / is consistent with (but doesn't provide direct evidence that) the idea that other channels of search across boundaries are less efficient than face-to-face (presumably "small touch", bc collocation) contact with people from other units (i.e., across boundaries). the logic is that if the search costs were the same / comparable, then those ideas would have initiation probability that is similar to collocation, in the absence of collocation.

                - So file under indirect evidence, and also need to actually micropub it. This excerpt is from discussion.

        - Question: is this claim slightly different from [Seeds](((akWOBsYB8))) for [[[[QUE]] - What are the most efficient routes to useful cross-boundary knowledge?]], in
the sense that the emphasize is in knowledge flow, where the value of people is much greater than written product.

            - --> Why might people be especially efficient access points to cross-boundary information?

        - Rich description of the range of interactions and affordances that mediate these access points (quick emails, memos, informal hallway chats), as well as culture that supports this

            - {{embed: [[@hargadonTechnologyBrokeringInnovation1997]]}}

            - Especially this bit: about the mixed, distributed nature of organizational memory

            - Reminds me very much of [[@ackermanOrganizationalMemoryObjects2004]]'s "five discrete memories": A [HLG employee](((95SLsSLsN))) drew on five discrete "small memories" in her handling of a hotline call, such as the telephone system's short-term memory of the group's activity, her own short-term memory, scrap paper, the CAll Tracking (CAT) system, and records in the CARL database, instead of a single monolithic memory

[[January 18th, 2021]]

- Here we have a concrete #example-of encountering a bridging [[analogy]], but also in conjunction with people, cc [[[[QUE]] - What are the most efficient routes to useful cross-boundary knowledge?]]

    - She [encounters a phrase on the cover of Scientific American](**Martine Rothblatt: **Subscribe to __Scientific American__. I’m sorry to put an advertisement in here, but I find __Scientific American__ and __National Geographic__ to have like the greatest ways for laypeople, which I do consider myself a layperson, to learn about all different types of science that they might not know anything about. So, one day, I got my __Scientific American__ in the mail, and on the cover, it was “Using Electronics to Cure Diseases.” Well, here I am, like my whole career has just been like electronic engineering, building satellites, and now, because of my daughter, I’m in this medical field. So, I’m like so excited. It was one of those lightning bolts to the soul. Now, I have a chance to bring my male and female side together, to bring my satellite and my biology side together and merge them.): "using electronics to cure diseases". She's primed to be excited about hte potential of hte idea because of her background in EE and satellites with Sirius XM, and her work with pulmonary hypertension for her daughter

    - She then [developed a relationship with the right person to talk to to develop this idea](So I got very excited, and I had the chance to meet and now work with and support the work of Dr. Tracey. He taught me a very simple sentence, Tim, which I’ve subsequently found to be absolutely true in all the research I’ve read. It is that the nervous system touches every single cell in your body. The nervous system touches every single cell in our body. The largest nerve in the body, there’s one nerve that is way, way larger than all the rest of them, it’s the vagus nerve. It starts in our mind. It wraps around our heart, our lungs, our gut. It’s an immense nerve.): Kevin Tracey, basically the "father of bioelectronic medicine", and now exploring vagal stimulation therapy

    - The evidence base is limited within mainstream Western medical research, but there is a way to do [[synthesis]], bringing in ["trial and error" evidence from thousands of years of Chinese acupuncture practice](**Martine Rothblatt: **Yeah. It is totally true, and why really would it not be true? I mean, thousands of years of Chinese civilization, they have had a chance to do so much trial and error, and they were a literate civilization for so long, so the results of that trial and error could be passed on and passed on. So, I do think it’s entirely rational that they would have figured this out, and what I’m hoping for now and what I’m trying to support is there is an opportunity to what I call in my own words, crack the human neurome. So, what that means, that there are a unique pattern of amplitudes and signal lanes and signal voltages that will activate some different part of the vagus nerve than others. Each of these different voltages and wavelengths will correlate to a different part of the human body. We don’t know what those are.): [primed from theory of the vagus nerve to recognize](((en-O7VbVu))) the potential sources of therapeutic effects of acupuncture, since they happen to target the key spots that would also stimulate the therapeutic effects of the vagus nerve

        - This reminds me of how Isaac Newton had expressed high skepticism that solutions for the longitude problem could come from outside of astronomic science, in response to multiple failures of proposals from outside astronomy [[@cattaniDeconstructingOutsiderPuzzle2017]]

- Digging through the notes under the [[[[QUE]] - What are the most efficient routes to useful cross-boundary knowledge?]], I am currently focusing on exploring the sources suggested under the following couple of claims.

    - [[[[CLM]] - Substantial portions of knowledge that is critical for innovation are not written down]]

        - #Thought-Fragment This got me thinking: how can [[tacit knowledge]] be codified in a way that is transferable?

        - Want to learn more about this idea: ((cSP4aTgBX))

    - [[[[CLM]] - In interdisciplinary domains, network-based foraging is more powerful than search-based foraging]]

        - #Thought-Fragment This is partially the inspiration for why I added a graph/list option in the wireframe. Maybe, a between-subjects study during the interface evaluation could help reaffirm this claim?
