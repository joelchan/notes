- # Synthesis

    - Hypothesis: we have far better evidence of **people** being the initial / most important first entry points into ideas across disciplinary (and other) boundaries, compared to search or recommendation that is separated from a social interaction of some kind. This is a variant of [[CLM - In interdisciplinary domains, network-based foraging is more powerful than search-based foraging]]

    - We have lots of evidence of people being an effective (and in many cases the most preferred) channel to cross-boundary information

        - In describing how scientists at an interdisciplinary center imported information from outside their specialty, [[@palmerWorkBoundariesScience2001]]

            - For example, Palmer writes, "no other type of information interaction is likely to be [as] efficient and profitable [as interactive discussions with colleagues]" (p. 33-34)

            - She also summarized that scientists at the interdisciplinary research center imported information across disciplinary boundaries predominantly via **personal networks** (pp. 31, 32-35). For example, ((YRq-AQNqf))

        - There is also research on sources of innovation in innovation contests and firm-/organizational-level innovation that suggests an [[outsider innovation]]

            - For example, [[@jeppesenMarginalityProblemsolvingEffectiveness2010]]

        - Additional indirect evidence comes from the literature on collocation and collaboration, which so far we can see generally seems to find facilitative effects on knowledge transfer and collaboration from induced face-to-face contact [[CLM - Physical proximity greatly facilitates initiation of new collaborations]]

            - An entry point is [[@cataliniMicrogeographyDirectionInventive2017]]

                - This work *suggests* / is consistent with the idea that other channels of search across boundaries are less efficient than face-to-face (presumably "small touch", bc collocation) contact with people from other units (i.e., across boundaries). the logic is that if the [search costs]([[search costs of innovation]]

            - Similarly, [[@boudreauFieldExperimentSearch2017]]

                - Note, however: this effect seems to be driven by [facilitating scientist pairs who are from the same clinical area to collaborate](The [estimated increased likelihood of collaboration](((WqhZS9HHR))) from being randomly assigned to be in the same breakout room dropped to basically zero when they added an interaction term between being in the same room and whether pairs of scientists were from the same clinical area; this interaction term was [statistically significant](((jvGl0gqAS))) at p < .10), which suggests there might still be [important inefficiencies](((J4R-1bnk-))) to accessing and using cross-boundary knowledge, even when you get initial access to it through a person.

    - We lack evidence that literature discovery tools that don't involve tight integration with at least one person can actually help people cross knowledge boundaries

    - Why might people be especially efficient access points to cross-boundary information?

        - One explanation might be that [[CLM - Substantial portions of knowledge that is critical for innovation are not written down]]

            - This is partially because [[CLM - Knowledge is fundamentally contextual]]

        - Another related explanation could be [the oblique nature of analogical inspiration]([[CLM - A significant proportion of the benefits of analogical stimuli is oblique or indirect]]

            - This, combined with the previous point, may mean that encountering a paper from a different domain, no matter how relevant, may be inert in itself, if it isn't connected to a rich process of inspiration (e.g., reformulation, query)

    - Note that there are still some inefficiencies for the people route

        - For example, [[@laneEngineeringSerendipityWhen]]

            - It's notable that the observed positive effects here were for estimated [less than 20% of the scientist pairs](note: only 2% of the pairs fell into the "partial overlap" category for field similarity, and the majority of scientists (about 80%) had "low intellectual similarity" (i.e., ~2 common keywords or fewer))!

            - And in some cases (e.g., when field similarity was high), there were [*dampening* effects on co-authorship in the 6 years following the symposium](scientist pairs who were [randomly assigned to talk to each other](((Dvg9ncop6))) (and did so, face-to face) at an [interdisciplinary medical imaging symposium](((HvQgkhAIF))) had *fewer* [co-authored publications with their partner after the symposium](((Dxba0prqe))) when the pair had [high field similarity](((_eEx8ZIIv))), compared to low or moderate overlap (for which there were no clear effects; maybe a slightly positive effect for moderately field-similar pairs, but the 95% confidence interval crosses zero)).

            - #appraisal - these results seem a bit fragile to me: they rest on interaction terms in relatively complex OLS models.

            - Caveats aside, this result suggests that the likelihood that a randomly paired interaction, even within a relatively shared [community of interest]([[communities of interest]]

        - These results raises the question: [[QUE - What is the range of expected benefits of engineered interactions with potential informants across knowledge boundaries]]

orignaization, description, indexing of inofmration in forms of indexes,
catalogs, and reference books makes information accessible to users.

                        - Xinâs question/comment: not sure whether we
could say information is cross-boundary, or the attribute of cross-boundary **lies in its use** by interdisciplinary people

                            - Social construction of technology

                                - (Also as SCOT) is a theory within the field of science andÂ technologyÂ studies. Advocates of SCOT argue thatÂ technologyÂ does not determine human action, but that rather, human action shapesÂ technology.

                            - Answer: why is information that is analogy far apart initially? Boundaries are there for what reason?

                                - Maybe attention, or information-noise ratio? Different classification categories. Prioritize other kinds of metadata which are missing from current infrastructure.

                    - Potential and indirect claim: Citation indexes are likely useful signals for interdisciplinary researchers. The fact that citation index sometimes coming from **someone** in another field or is inherited afterwards by another field bypasses the vocabulary mismatch problem across different fields.

                        - There might be a process starting from the first citation attempt between domain A and domain B. It fruits into interdisciplinary journals (Bioinformatics, etc. )

                        - Seems like People + X (activity) is the most efficient route. What would be X?

        - From [[@cataliniMicrogeographyDirectionInventive2017]]

            - Key idea: [[colocation (matters for the) innovationcollaboration]]

            - Note: collaboration in this paper seems to be an equal share, i.e. not explicitly distinguish source and target domains

            - Ecno-metric for collaboration similarity -> distance, natural experiments etc. instead of regression

                - not a lot of choice in the method

                        - (Disputing) From Catalini: reduction in travel costs leads to an increase in researchers' collaboration decision, specifically helping male researchers
