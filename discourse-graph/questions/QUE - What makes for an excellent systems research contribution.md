    - Descriptions

        - An excellent, impactful systems / design project makes a **conceptual** contribution, if it is to be a research contribution. That is, we should not only be able to do something we couldn't before, but we should know something we didn't before [üìù](An exception might be a "proof of concept", where the knowledge gain is "we thought this was impossible! now we know it's possible". But this is sort of an unusual contribution genre that I'm not as familiar with, in part because it's rare. [[Aniket Kittur]] has more experience with this sort of contribution.).

        - Examples of conceptual contributions might include:

            - innovating in a [[Need thesis]], such as modifying constraints, questioning assumptions, and/or innovating on the elements or combination of elements in an [[Approach thesis]]

            - See also: [[@hookStrongConceptsIntermediatelevel2012]] and [[@galeyHowPrototypeArgues2010]]

            - And [[@wobbrockResearchContributionsHumancomputer2016]] for compelling examples of this in [[HCI]]

            - litany about what kind of knowledge is gained from design research: "if you want to support person P in context C for goal G, then design D will help because of theory T, and we know this because of evidence E from [[@vandenakkerPrinciplesMethodsDevelopment1999b]]

        - Note, however, that this conceptual contribution is almost never apparent from the start. The creation of the artifact (and observation of its use) *is* the way we generate that knowledge. So don't fret if the conceptual contribution of your research isn't super clear from the start, or even while you're making the artifact. Instead, try to have some draft understanding of this externalized to reflect on, and ensure that you're grounded in a thought-out [[Need thesis]] and [[Approach thesis]] (which you will iterate on as you progress).

        - TL/DR: it‚Äôs not necessarily just about one singular insight, but it is really important to motivate the problem and why certain design decisions were made versus alternative approaches. ¬†https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/86066-what-makes-a-good-hci-systems-paper/fulltext
