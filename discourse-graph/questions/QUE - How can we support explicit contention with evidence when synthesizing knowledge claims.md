    - Description

        - Reasoning and [[synthesis]]

        - Examples

            - Consider the case of [[COVID-19]]

            - Another example is [[IVEO Matrix]]

            - In the limit, [[systematic review]]

        - Leaving this out entirely can devolve into mere "counting" and consensus (e.g., based on reputation of authors), which leaves much to be desired! Although this might be all that is really possible epistemically for certain fields of inquiry, and any more quantitative sophistication might be performative rather than actually useful.

        - The core issue here is that evidence is not binary (yes or no). There is nuance behind it.

            - And this nuance matters.

                - It tells us where the argument is "soft", or where we might want to push.

                - And the *reasons* behind the softness and uncertainty may give us clues as to what to do next to resolve tensions and construct novel explanations.

                - In the simplest case, we can use nuanced evidence to decide that one of two competing explanations or claims has more weight.

        - But the notion of "levels of evidence" is contentious, especially in settings with high [[interdisciplinarity]]

            - reminds me of [[@suriAdvancementsResearchSynthesis2009]]

            - later [[Sally Thorne]]

                - [[@greenhalghTimeChallengeSpurious2018]]

            - Also great discussion with [[Jodi Schneider]]

            - Compressing these debates into a single number is technically and mechanically valuable, needed even, for [[synthesis]]

        - What does this mean for conceptual models of [[provenance]]

            - At the least, it seems likely that we would like to have some way to represent or link to the negotiated *rationale* for anything that is like an empirical support score.

            - The thorniness of this problem, though, might be why models like [[stdSEPIO]]

        - Much prior work has grappled with these conceptual difficulties.

            - [[@niccolucciExpressingReliabilityCIDOC2017]]

                - There is significant controversy still over this proposal, however; as of [[October 21st, 2020]]

                - One [issue](https://hyp.is/ewJrXBPnEeu5POdJtyFI7w/www.cidoc-crm.org/Issue/ID-349-belief-values) is a desire to *separate* issues of being ([ontology]([[ontologies]]

                    - There is a related rationale behind the postulation that [[stdNanopublications]]

            - People have worked on the goal of representing evidence [[@brushSEPIOSemanticModel2016]]

            - In [[@clarkMicropublicationsSemanticModel2014]]

            - [[@brushSEPIOSemanticModel2016]]

                - They support connecting to the [[stdEvidence and Conclusion (ECO) ontology]]

            - Different from [[stdMicropublication]]

            - In some areas, such as [[systematic review]]

            - [[@grothAnatomyNanopublication2010]]

        - In general, a more quantitative approach is more amenable to computational, *quantitative* integration; if, however, it doesn't include rich, explicit mappings between the number and the [[context]]

        - ON the flip side, a more qualitative approach (e.g., [[evidence lines]]

            - One challenge maybe is that not all subdomains have a nice ontology of evidence types, although it's
