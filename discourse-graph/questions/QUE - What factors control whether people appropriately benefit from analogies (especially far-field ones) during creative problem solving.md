                            - Abstract

                                - Analogical transfer in problem solving is one example of analogical cognition, which also includes metaphors, similes, and case-based reasoning. The dominant theories in this area posit that abstract schemata mediate transfer (K. J. Holyoak, 1984a, 1985) or that problem solving by means of analogy is accomplished through application of the formal or deep structural characteristics of one problem to another (D. Centner, 1983, 1989). More recently, exemplar-based accounts (D. L. Medin & B. H. Ross, 1989; B. H. Ross, 1987) have emphasized problem content and exemplar-specific details in the various stages of transfer. The present article reviews research on analogical transfer and analyzes the theoretical models in light of this evidence. An adequate theory of analogical transfer must account not only for the use of schematic knowledge but also for the importance of surface informa- tion in all stages of transfer (Reeves & Weisberg, 1993a). As such, it will be a hybrid of the various models presented, with exemplar-based models such as that of B. H. Ross as a base.

                                - Although experts should be well positioned to convey their superior knowledge and skill to novices, the organization of that knowledge, and particularly its level of abstraction, may make it difficult for them to do so. Using an electronic circuit-wiring task, the authors found that experts as compared with beginners used more abstract and advanced statements and fewer concrete statements when providing task instructions to novices. In a 2nd study, the authors found that beginner-instructed novices performed better than expert-instructed novices and reported fewer problems with the instructions when performing the same task. In Study 2, the authors found that although novices performed better on the target task when instructed by beginners, they did better on a different task within the same domain when instructed by experts. The evidence suggests that the abstract, advanced concepts conveyed by experts facilitated the transfer of learning between the different tasks.

                                - When we encounter a new problem, we are often reminded of similar problems solved earlier and may use the solution procedure from an old problem to solve a new one. Such analogical transfer, however, has been difficult to demonstrate empirically, even within a single experimental session. This article proposes a framework for conceptualizing analogical problem solving that can account for the conflicting findings in the literature. In addition, the framework leads to two predictions concerning the transfer behavior of experts and novices. These predictions concern both positive and negative transfer and are based on the different types of features included in the problem representations of experts and novices. First, when two problems share structural features but not surface features, spontaneous positive transfer should be more likely in experts than in novices. Second, when two problems share surface but not structural features, spontaneous negative transfer should be stronger for novices than for experts. These predictions were supported by the results of three experiments involving college students solving a complex arithmetic word problem.

                                - Information learned in one situation often fails to transfer to a similarly structured situation. However, prior findings suggest that comparing two or more instances that embody the same principle can promote abstraction of a schema that can be transferred to new situations. In two lines of research, we examined the effects of analogical encoding on knowledge transfer in negotiation situations. In Experiment 1, undergraduates were more likely to propose optimal negotiation strategies and less likely to propose compromises (a suboptimal strategy) when they received analogy training. In Experiment 2, graduate management students who drew an analogy from two cases were nearly three times more likely to incorporate the strategy from the training cases into their negotiations than were students given the same cases separately. For both novices and experienced participants, the comparison process can be an efficient means of abstracting principles for later application.

                                - A central goal of cognitive science is to develop a general theory of transfer to explain how people use and apply their prior knowledge to solve new problems. Previous work has identified multiple mechanisms of transfer including (but not limited to) analogy, knowledge compilation, and constraint violation. The central hypothesis investigated in the current work is that the particular profile of transfer processes activated for a given situation depends on both (a) the type of knowledge to be transferred and how it is represented, and (b) the processing demands of the transfer task. This hypothesis was investigated in two laboratory training studies. The results from Experiment 1 show that each mechanism predicts specific behavioural patterns of performance across a common set of transfer tasks. The results from Experiment 2 show that people can adaptively shift between transfer mechanisms depending on their prior knowledge and the character- istics of the task environment. A framework for the development of a general theory of transfer based on multiple mechanisms is proposed and implications of the theory are discussed for measuring and understanding knowledge transfer.

                                - Recent findings of transfer and nontransfer in such areas as planning and problem management skills, computer programming instruction, and literacy- related cognitive skills reveal paradoxes that invite explanation. In this article, we separate the "how" of transfer- the mechanisms that lead to it -from the "what" of transfer-the kind of knowledge and skill that might get trans- ferred. We argue that transfer occurs in two ways. Low-road transfer depends on extensive, varied practice and occurs by the automatic triggerihg of well-learneid behavior in a new context. High-road transfer occurs by inten- tional imindful abstraction of something from one context and application in a new context. Such transfer can either be of the forward-reaching kind, whereby one mindfully abstracts basic elements in anticipation for later application, or of the backward-reaching kind, where one faces a new situation and deliberately searches for relevant knowledge already acquired. Findings of transfer or nontransfer reflect whether the conditions for leither low-road or high-road transfer were met. Qualitative predictions steyming from tihis theory of the mechanisms of transfer are offered and discussed.

                                - In this article we provide an overview of research on transfer, highlighting its main tenets. Then we look at interviews of two 5th-grade students learning about mathematical concepts regarding operations on positive and negative quantities. We attempt to focus on how their learning is influenced by their prior knowledge and experience. We take the position that transfer is a theory of learning and we attempt to show that it cannot provide a solid foundation for explaining such examples of learning.

                                - Similarity is universally acknowledged to be central in transfer, but recent research suggests that its role is complex. The present research attempts to isolate and compare the determinants of similarity-based access to memory and the determinants of the subjective soundness and similarity of a match. We predicted, based on structure-mapping theory, that subjective soundness would depend on the degree of shared relational structure, particularly higher-order structure such as causal bindings. In contrast, we predicted that memory retrieval would be highly sensitive to surface similarities such as common object attributes. To assess retrievability, in three studies, subjects were asked to read a large set of stories and were later given a set of probe stories that resembled the original stories in systematically different ways; e.g., purely relational analogies, surface-similarity matches, or overall (literal similarity) matches. Subjects were told to write out any of the original stories that came to mind. To assess subjective soundness, independent subjects (and also the same reminding subjects) were asked to rate the inferential soundness of each pair; i.e., how well inferences true of one story would apply to the other. As predicted, subjective soundness was highly related to the degree of common relational structure, while retrievability was chiefly related to the degree of surface similarity. Ratings of the similarity of the pairs did not predict the retrievability ordering, arguing against the possibility that the retrieval ordering simply reflected overall similarity. Further, a fourth study demonstrated that subjects given a forced-choice recognition task could discriminate between possible matches on the basis of relational structure, ruling out the possibility that the poor relational retrieval resulted from forgetting or failing to encode the relational structure. We conclude that there is a dissociation between the similarity that governs access to long-term memory and that which is used in evaluating and reasoning from a present match. We describe a model, called MAC/FAC ("Many are called but few are chosen"), that uses a two-stage similarity retrieval process to model these findings. Finally, we speculate on the implications of this view for learning and transfer.

Strong evidence exists that comparison induces a structural alignment process that renders common relational structure more salient. We hypothesized that comparisons between exemplars would facilitate learning and transfer of categories that cohere around a common relational property. The effect of comparison was investigated using learning trials that elicited a separate classification response for each item in presentation pairs that could be drawn from the same or different categories. This methodology ensures consideration of both items and invites comparison through an implicit same–different judgment inherent in making the two responses. In a test phase measuring learning and transfer, the comparison group significantly outperformed a control group receiving an equivalent training session of single-item classification learning. Comparison-based learners also outperformed the control group on a test of far transfer, that is, the ability to accurately classify items from a novel domain that was relationally alike, but surface-dissimilar, to the training materials. Theoretical and applied implications of this comparison advantage are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)

    - i think the more general claim here is that open goals can make it more likely that potentially beneficial stimuli will be noticed and processed in useful ways, even if there are normal barriers that might prevent this (such as in the case of far analogies, difficulties with mapping, etc.)

    - with [two analogs and no hint](slight advantage of similar analog pairs compared to one analog; biggest advantage for dissimilar analog pairs, although still quite a bit lower than ceiling (~50% before hint)), the base rate goes up to ~50% (for dissimilar analog pairs), though still lower than with hint

    - #theory  [hints really help]([[[[CLM]] - People are more likely to benefit from analogies if they encounter/process them with an active goal or license to use them for inspiration]]) in original experiments, but are likely far from sufficient in our case

        - After digging a bit more into [[@gickAnalogicalProblemSolving1980]], the initial result in Experiment 1 is more like a pilot study ([N=~10 per cell](Participants: 40 undergrads in intro psych (10 per condition))?), but Experiment 2 is a bit stronger ([N=~50 per cell](((vvoHhxAvu))))

        - The specific setting has some important differences from our setting:

            - The "bad" condition (no hint) is one where the **task is explicitly framed as separate from the problem solving task**, although various characteristics of the experiment suggest it wouldn't be hard at all to infer that they should be related (e.g., minimal delay, demand characteristics from typical experiments). In contrast, in the cases we care about, search is motivated by / embedded in a larger problem solving task

                - So any component of the original hint > no hint effect that has to do with instructional set effects should not transfer to our setting

                - Note, however, that in Experiment 5, whose "incubation" procedure resembled that of the [[open goals]] paradigm in [[@tsengRoleTimingAnalogical2008]], [[@patalanoOpportunisticPlanningBeing1997]], and others, the basic hint >> no hint result remained untouched

            - The analogs were **well within the range of knowledge of the subjects**, and were __pre-processed__ to highlight the relevant schematic elements and solutions. In contrast, in the settings we care about, the new knowledge is likely outside of reach of the seeker, and presented/encountered in "raw" form (vs. written to include/highlight key schematic elements).

                - In cases where the knowledge is within reach of hte seeker, relatively simple interventions like hints might suffice, as we see in these experiments.

                - So any component of the original hint > no hint effect that has to do with lack of understanding / hiding of the schematic elements is likely to be magnified in our setting

                    - Reminds me of cognitive costs we saw in [[@chanBenefitsPitfallsAnalogies2011]]

                - This, along with the previous point about [disembeddness of task from problem solving](The "bad" condition (no hint) is one where the **task is explicitly framed as separate from the problem solving task**, although various characteristics of the experiment suggest it wouldn't be hard at all to infer that they should be related (e.g., minimal delay, demand characteristics from typical experiments). In contrast, in the cases we care about, search is motivated by / embedded in a larger problem solving task), might be by far the most important aspect of the original experiments

            - The **analogs were largely experienced in relative isolation** (max amongst two "distractors" in [Experiment 4](Procedure: Memorize and summarize three stories, where one is the attack-dispersion story in a "story recall task" and two are [distractor stories](((8hr4ve5ke))), before proceeding to "problem-solving tasK', where they tried to solve the radiation problem. In Hint condition, booklet instructions noted "In solving this problem you may find that one of the stories you read before will give you a hint for a solution of this problem") of [[@gickAnalogicalProblemSolving1980]]). In contrast, in our setting, people are facing orders of magnitude higher levels of [[information overload]] to sift through

                - So the effects of distractors and load might be *stronger* in our case

                    - This reminds me of the idea of "[interactive honing](The Vision Specialist [said](((EMco58rHR))) talking to another expert was like "honing" two interactive databases to efficiently converge on the right person/reference)" that participants in [[@palmerWorkBoundariesScience2001]] touted

        - The upshot of all of this is that ^^**any of the "medicine" that worked in these original experiments (including a mere "hint") is likely going to be insufficient for our setting**^^.

    - #theory [[[[CLM]] - People are more likely to benefit from analogies if they encounter/process them with an active goal or license to use them for inspiration]]

        - An early indication of this effect was demonstrated in the classic study by [[@gickAnalogicalProblemSolving1980]]: without an explicit hint that a given analogical source was relevant, participants who read and summarized the source infrequently (~20-30% of the time) noticed its relevance for an analogous problem and transferred the solution; when a hint was given that the story (or even one of 3 stories) might be relevant for a problem, transfer rates were much higher (~70-90%). This was demonstrated across [two](When they [weren't told](((nUhHJHMvI))) that the story they had [just read (as 1 of 3 stories) and summarized/recalled](((4cg_grSB8))) was analogous to a problem they were asked to solve, [undergrads](((b1acxCzgd))) [only transferred the analogous solution ~20% of the time](((U91thKLi8))); when they were explicitly told that one of the stories might contain a hint, they transferred the analogous solution ~90% of the time) [experiments](((GCX7BvKNW))), and in contrast with earlier [sets](((w6f5AauxY))) of [experiments](((B5PNvu38b))) where transfer rates were almost at ceiling. Note though that these were undergraduate intro psych participants, and the Ns were quite small (in the low 10s per condition).

        - The basic phenomenon was established in two experiments in [[@gickAnalogicalProblemSolving1980]]:

            - participants noticed and transferred a key solution from an analogous story between ~[20](When they [weren't told](((nUhHJHMvI))) that the story they had [just read (as 1 of 3 stories) and summarized/recalled](((4cg_grSB8))) was analogous to a problem they were asked to solve, [undergrads](((b1acxCzgd))) [only transferred the analogous solution ~20% of the time](((U91thKLi8))); when they were explicitly told that one of the stories might contain a hint, they transferred the analogous solution ~90% of the time)-[40](((GCX7BvKNW)))% of the time without a hint. This was in sharp contrast to near-ceiling [[spontaneous analogical transfer]] when the possible connection between the source problem and the target problem was hinted at in instructions (~90% transfer), and in two prior experiments where this hint was also integrated into instructions (~[70](((B5PNvu38b)))-[100](((w6f5AauxY)))% of the time).

        - This contrast between spontaneous transfer and hint-assisted transfer was replicated across three initial experiments in [[@gickSchemaInductionAnalogical1983]], where various attempts to facilitate [[spontaneous analogical transfer]] --- [summarization](No advantage of summary over recall.), [statement of principle](((jPHrhJ99T))), and [diagram of principle](((Q9SmOi4Nv))) --- all failed to move the needle up from this low base rate of approximately ~30% transfer.

[[Notes from Joel's PhD about analogy]]

- What do we currently know about what influences this process? [[[[QUE]] - What factors control whether people appropriately benefit from analogies (especially far-field ones) during creative problem solving?]]

    - The would-be analogizer must have a “prepared mind” [[[[CLM]] - Inspiration favors the prepared mind]]

        - If designers or problem solvers are looking for potential analogies, (e.g., have been instructed to use analogies in problem-solving), the likelihood of successfully accessing and using a far-field analogy goes up significantly ([Gick & Holyoak, 1980]([[@gickAnalogicalProblemSolving1980]]); Casakin & Goldschmidt, 1999)

        - If designers or problem solvers have an open goal to solve the problem (e.g., they reached an impasse and are now puttering around looking for inspiration or just relief from unproductive problem solving, but still really really want to solve the problem), then the likelihood of successfully accessing and using a far-field analogy goes up significantly (Christensen & Schunn, 2005; Tseng et al, 2008) – this fits with some work on incubation in creative problem-solving (see, e.g., Seifert et al, 1995)

    - Superficial similarity (e.g., near-field analogies, exemplars/[[prototypes]]) dominate access quite strongly

        - Using [[prototypes]] (high superficial detail) during design was associated with decreased use of far-field analogies relative to sketches or unsupported ideas (little or no superficial detail; Christensen & Schunn, 2007)

        - Using exemplars results in lots of transfer of solution elements, even when the designer “doesn’t want to” (Dahl & Moreau, 2002; Jaarsveld & van Leeuwen, 2005; Jansson & Smith, 1991; Marsh, Bink, & Hicks, 1999; Marsh, Landau, & Hicks, 1996; Marsh, Ward, & Landau, 1999; Smith, Ward, & Schumacher, 1993; Ward, 1994)

    - Beyond just looking at levels of superficial similarity, the way a potential analog is represented (e.g., how it’s presented to the designer in the environment, how it’s represented in memory) matters

        - A domain general representation of an analog in memory and when presented to designers is better for retrieval and successful use than a domain specific representation (Linsey et al, 2007)

        - Some modalities appear to be better than others for retrieval, e.g., Markman, Taylor & Gentner (2007) found that auditorily presented proverbs were more easily recalled later than verbally presented ones.

        - Going back to the perceptual simulation idea, it may be that certain modes of representation (form vs. content) lend themselves better to activating relevant image schemas; this complicates things, such that it’s no longer merely the level of detail that matters, but the type of detail and how the analog actually looks, that affects analogical processes in different ways. Investigating how these various dimensions of modality might interact should be interesting.
[[May 19th, 2020]]

- For Chen: [[[[QUE]] - What factors control whether people appropriately benefit from analogies (especially far-field ones) during creative problem solving?]]

    - Need to refine this more. What do we mean by "appropriately process"?

    - Classically, this has been studied in cognitive science in terms of [[spontaneous analogical transfer]]: that is, given that we know you have encountered some piece of knowledge that we know is analogous to your current problem, how likely is it that you will correctly notice the mapping and transfer that analogy to solve your problem?

    - In the setting of analogical inspiration systems, the situation is slightly different: we have many options for controlling the manner in which you encounter an analogy.

        - Abstractness/concreteness of the analogy

            - Examples? [[Schema]]s?

        - Modality of the analogy (related to the first) [[@chanBenefitsPitfallsAnalogies2011]]

            - Some work showing that people do more [[spontaneous analogical transfer]]

        - Manner of processing

            - Probably biggest effect: [[Analogical Comparison]] with at least two analogs. The comparison process (if appropriately scaffolded) leads to processing of them in terms of [[Schema]]s, which then predicts spontaneous transfer.

                - #SupportedBy

                    - [[[[EVD]] - direct comparison of dissimilar analogs approximately doubled rates of spontaneous far analogical transfer for the radiation problem - [[@gickSchemaInductionAnalogical1983]]]]

        - Mindset "prepared mind effect" [[@tsengRoleTimingAnalogical2008]]; see also [[@siangliulueProvidingTimelyExamples2015]]

    - In general, this is a hard problem. It's quite tricky to get people to benefit from analogical inspirations, even if we know they are "good". Original demonstration from [[@gickAnalogicalProblemSolving1980]]

        - Participants [rated](![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FSFVl17CxBW.png?alt=media&token=658f26b1-df77-4d12-ad79-f74e37c43a54)) the relevancy of near stimuli higher than far stimuli and also rated them more useful

        - The amount of ideas generated in each word set seemed greater in both word sets, but it was only in word set 2 which held statistically relevant results for greater [amount of ideas](![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FIuMYgn6URM.png?alt=media&token=eb9d5056-a052-4805-974c-8951b3694072)) generated by stimuli as opposed to the control

        - A lot here that I struggle to examine, but it has something to do with providing evidence that in word set 2 they were able to show that if [not given inspirational stimuli](![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FYDLsVXYo8D.png?alt=media&token=ca526866-d21c-4d8a-9825-56049fb6a424)) idea generation is reduced.

        - It is possible that inspirational stimuli become more relevant when all other means of ideation have been exhausted.

        - possible that far stimuli could be more beneficial if participants had been given more time for ideation.

        - near-field stimuli are superior to far-field stimuli
