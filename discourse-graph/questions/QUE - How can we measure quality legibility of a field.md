- #Question

    - Related to: [[[[QUE]] - (How) do fields of innovation vary in their legibility of quality?]]

    - # Synthesis

        - [[@coleHierarchySciences1983]] argues that basically frontier-level measures (citation concentration, obsolescence, peer review IRR, peer evals) don't give us much signal, but ["core knowledge" measures (e.g., textbooks) probably will]([[[[CLM]] - There is systematic variation in consensus of the core knowledge of fields - [[@coleHierarchySciences1983]]]]).

            - Really need to trace this forward, see whether there are any better signals today with better methods. To their credit, Cole et al were quite upfront about methodological limitations.

                - bunch more from: core of first half of paper is review of a bunch of prior studies, which basically provide no/negative evidence that there's systematic variation in consensus across fields that are thought to be at different levels of the [[hierarchy of the sciences]]: [[[[CLM]] - There is no systematic variation in consensus across fields on judging quality of contributions to research frontiers - [[@coleHierarchySciences1983]]]]
