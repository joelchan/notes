            - Really need to trace this forward, see whether there are any better signals today with better methods. To their credit, Cole et al were quite upfront about methodological limitations.

                - bunch more from: core of first half of paper is review of a bunch of prior studies, which basically provide no/negative evidence that there's systematic variation in consensus across fields that are thought to be at different levels of the [[hierarchy of the sciences]]
