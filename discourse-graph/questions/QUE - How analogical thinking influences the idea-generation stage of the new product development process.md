            - [[[[EVD]] - The percentage of analogies used by designers had a statistically significant effect on originality of product designs judged by potential customers of that product. - [[@dahlInfluenceValueAnalogical2002]]]]

            - [[[[EVD]] - Student subjects in the no prime (example)/multiple base of analogies condition produced designs that were statistically more original than the other combinations of w/ and w/o primes and single base/multiple bases of analogies. - [[@dahlInfluenceValueAnalogical2002]]]]

            - [[[[EVD]] - The external prime (example) reduced design originality by structuring the form of the design. - [[@dahlInfluenceValueAnalogical2002]]]]

            - [[[[EVD]] - Student subjects who are encouraged to access multiple base domains in the design task will access a higher proportion of far analogies than will those who are encouraged to access only one domain. - [[@dahlInfluenceValueAnalogical2002]]]]
