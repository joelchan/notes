- # Synthesis

    - Related questions:

        - [[QUE - What is the range of expected benefits of engineered interactions with potential informants across knowledge boundaries]]

    - I think the first subclaim is the most obvious one: [[CLM - Analogical distance of inspirations for an idea are positively related to the idea's creativity]]

        - There is some weak [support]([[SupportedBy]]

            - In the one case, analogical distance was measured post-hoc from the analogies that the sample of engineering students turned out to use (think of; not given). They found a __positive__ correlation between % far analogy use and originality/value: [[EVD - designs that were measured during an ideation session to have come from a higher percentage o... as more original and valuable by potential customer judges - @dahlInfluenceValueAnalogical2002]]

            - In the other case, analogical distance was not varied directly in terms of the stimuli, but was manipulated in a "one or more stimuli vs. no stimuli" way. All stimuli were near analogies. They found a __negative__ effect of the near stimuli compared to seeing nothing: [[EVD - Engineering students who were given one or more near analogies as stimuli generated design id...tential customer judges, compared to being given no stimuli - @dahlInfluenceValueAnalogical2002]]

        - There's also some [evidence]([[SupportedBy]]

            - [[EVD - highly novel papers had higher variance in their citation outcomes over a 15-year window, biased towards the higher impact tail of the distribution - @wangBiasNoveltyScience2017]]

        - ## Counterarguments

        - There is some [counter-evidence]([[Opposed By]]

            - For example, Dunbar traced the discovery process of four top molecular biology labs, and found that they rarely used far analogies to generate novel scientific concepts: [[EVD - Molecular biologists with a reputation for innovation rarely used very far analogies in their...d mainly on analogies to the same or other biological organisms - @dunbarHowScientistsThink1997]]

                - This is a strong result, even though it isn't experimental, due to its high external validity. Despite lack of experimental controls, it at least puts a cap on the claim about far analogies being important/necessary for creative breakthroughs, at least in molecular biology.

            - A very similar result was found by Saner et al (1999), who found that far analogies were basically never used in reasoning in psychology lab meetings, but were used in colloquia while ideas were being communicated with new audiences: [[EVD - Far analogies were rare and never used in psychology lab group meetings for reasoning (vs. me... rare in colloquia as well, but were frequently used for reasoning - @sanerAnalogiesOutBlue1999]]

            - Related to this is [[EVD - In a design team, concepts tended to be more similar to their immediately preceding concepts after far analogy use compared to using near or no analogies - @chanImpactAnalogiesCreative2015]]

            - Dunbar also claims that [[CLM - far analogies are systematically overrated in their importance for creative breakthroughs due to memory bias - @dunbarHowScientistsThink1997]]

                - Note: Most of the cases were drawn from other industries that were quite close by and ((E4MwwsilX)), so probably there is range restriction.

                    - 25 cases is also really really small for a correlation analysis.

                    - I think the most we can say from this is an existence proof that relatively [[near analogies]]

                    - Telling that I previously classified this study as "anecdotal"! Yikes... This was a rigorously done multiple-case-study analysis.
