- # Synthesis

    - Related questions:

        - [[[[QUE]] - What is the range of expected "benefits" of engineered interactions with potential "informants" across knowledge boundaries?]]

    - I think the first subclaim is the most obvious one: [[[[CLM]] - Analogical distance of inspirations for an idea are positively related to the idea's creativity]]. This is kind of a weak sauce claim, to be honest. A bit too general for my taste.

        - There is some weak [support]([[SupportedBy]]) from an early experiment from [[@dahlInfluenceValueAnalogical2002]] that everyone cites in the creativity/engineering design literature. Two core results relating to [[analogical distance]] come from the third experiment.

            - In the one case, analogical distance was measured post-hoc from the analogies that the sample of engineering students turned out to use (think of; not given). They found a __positive__ correlation between % far analogy use and originality/value: [[[[EVD]] - designs that were measured during an ideation session to have come from a higher percentage of far analogies were perceived as more original and valuable by potential customer judges - [[@dahlInfluenceValueAnalogical2002]]]]

            - In the other case, analogical distance was not varied directly in terms of the stimuli, but was manipulated in a "one or more stimuli vs. no stimuli" way. All stimuli were near analogies. They found a __negative__ effect of the near stimuli compared to seeing nothing: [[[[EVD]] - Engineering students who were given one or more near analogies as stimuli generated design ideas that were perceived as less original and valuable by potential customer judges, compared to being given no stimuli - [[@dahlInfluenceValueAnalogical2002]]]]

        - There's also some [evidence]([[SupportedBy]]) from citation level data that looks at combinations of "knowledge domains" (with journals as a proxy) and finds correlations between having atypical or highly novel combinations of knowledge domains being related to being outliers in terms of citation impact

            - [[[[EVD]] - papers with high median conventionality and high tail atypical combinations of journals they cited were 2x more likely than average to be in top 5 percent of citation distribution - [[@uzziAtypicalCombinationsScientific2013]]]]

            - [[[[EVD]] - highly novel papers were more likely to be in the top 1% of citations in the long run, but not in the short run, and particularly in other fields - [[@wangBiasNoveltyScience2017]]]]

            - [[[[EVD]] - highly novel papers had higher variance in their citation outcomes over a 15-year window, biased towards the higher impact tail of the distribution - [[@wangBiasNoveltyScience2017]]]]

        - [Evidence]([[SupportedBy]]) from patent studies (at coarser level of granularity)

            - [[[[EVD]] - patents filed by inventors who was new to the patent's field tended to be more novel; this was less true if they collaborated with an expert in the new field - [[@artsParadiseNoveltyLoss2018a]]]]

            - [[[[EVD]] - patenting teams with a greater number of prior patenting fields were more likely to generate patents that were technological outliers - [[@kneelandExploringUnchartedTerritory2020]]]]

        - Some complicated, qualified [support]([[SupportedBy]]) also comes from studies that find contingent benefits of far analogies

            - [[[[EVD]] - Far analogies' effects on MechE students' ideation fluency and diversity were different depending on timing: more ideas (but with more functional repeats) before ideation began, vs. more functionally distinct designs after problem solving began (during a break), both compared to seeing nothing - [[@tsengRoleTimingAnalogical2008]]]]

            - [[[[EVD]] - Far analogies' effects on MechE students' novelty of ideas were different depending on timing: more novel ideas when seeing them after problem solving began vs. before - [[@tsengRoleTimingAnalogical2008]]]]

        - Also some [support]([[SupportedBy]]) from [[outsider innovation]] effects

            - [[[[EVD]] - Self-rated technical distance from open innovation contest problems was slightly positively correlated with submitting winning solutions - [[@jeppesenMarginalityProblemsolvingEffectiveness2010]]]]

        - And some [support]([[SupportedBy]]) in the form of negative effects of near analogies

            - Near associated with fixation: [[[[EVD]] - Undergrad MechE students who saw near analogies (clocks) for a time-keeping problem preferred discrete (drip-based) solutions to continuous (e.g., flow/fill) solutions - [[@tsengRoleTimingAnalogical2008]]]]

        - Weak [[SupportedBy]] from examples

            - [[[[EVD]] - a substantial number of IDEO-designed products incorporated technological solutions from other industries - [[@hargadonTechnologyBrokeringInnovation1997]]]]

        - ## Counterarguments

        - There is some [counter-evidence]([[Opposed By]]) from [[m/s/In vivo]] studies of science labs and design teams

            - For example, Dunbar traced the discovery process of four top molecular biology labs, and found that they rarely used far analogies to generate novel scientific concepts: [[[[EVD]] - Molecular biologists with a reputation for innovation rarely used very far analogies in their lab meetings while generating novel scientific concepts; instead, they relied mainly on analogies to the same or other biological organisms - [[@dunbarHowScientistsThink1997]]]]

                - This is a strong result, even though it isn't experimental, due to its high external validity. Despite lack of experimental controls, it at least puts a cap on the claim about far analogies being important/necessary for creative breakthroughs, at least in molecular biology.

            - A very similar result was found by Saner et al (1999), who found that far analogies were basically never used in reasoning in psychology lab meetings, but were used in colloquia while ideas were being communicated with new audiences: [[[[EVD]] - Far analogies were rare and never used in psychology lab group meetings for reasoning (vs. mere mentions); far analogies were rare in colloquia as well, but were frequently used for reasoning - [[@sanerAnalogiesOutBlue1999]]]]

            - Related to this is [[[[EVD]] - In a design team, concepts tended to be more similar to their immediately preceding concepts after far analogy use compared to using near or no analogies - [[@chanImpactAnalogiesCreative2015]]]]. This isn't *quite* a measure of novelty as we normally think of it (the reference for similarity is concepts generated in the last 10 or 5 lines). But it at least opposes the idea that you might be primarily using far analogies to get some distance from where you currently are.

            - Dunbar also claims that [[[[CL]] - [[far analogies]] are systematically overrated in their importance for creative breakthroughs due to memory bias - [[@dunbarHowScientistsThink1997]]]]

                - One [support]([[SupportedBy]]) for this is a specific anecdote of tracing a significant discovery through a series of (near) analogies, and then asking the scientist to recall/recount the origins of that discovery: Dunbar found that [[[[EVD]] - A molecular biologist who had made a major scientific conceptual change did not recall any of the spontaneous analogies used to enact that change - [[@dunbarHowScientistsThink1997]]]]

        - And some experimental [counter-evidence]([[Opposed By]]) showing equal effects of near analogies on novelty

            - [[[[EVD]] - In general, MechE students' ideas when given near analogies were at least as novel, and sometimes moreso, then ideas generated with far analogies, or seeing nothing - [[@tsengRoleTimingAnalogical2008]]]]

            - [[[[EVD]] - no overall effect of analogical distance of cases on novelty or usefulness of campaign ad ideas - [[@althuizenSupportingCreativeProblem2014]]]]

            - [[[[EVD]] - overall marginally significant negative effect of analogically distant cases on creativity of campaign ad ideas, mostly for students with high creative ability - [[@althuizenSupportingCreativeProblem2014]]]]

        - Some experimental [counter-evidence]([[Opposed By]]) showing the opposite: far < near

            - [[[[EVD]] - participants who received computationally selected far analogical stimuli had a lower ceiling on novelty and quality of ideas compared to participants who received near or no analogical stimuli - [[@fuMeaningFarImpact2013]]]]

        - [Counter-evidence]([[Opposed By]]) from observational/correlational studies

            - Admittedly underpowered correlational case study from industry: [[[[EVD]] - No significant correlation between analogical distance of cross-industry inspirations and degree of innovation outcome (incremental, market or breakthrough, and radical) - [[@enkelCreativeImitationExploring2010]]]].

                - Note: Most of the cases were drawn from other industries that were quite close by and ((E4MwwsilX)), so probably there is range restriction.

                    - 25 cases is also really really small for a correlation analysis.

                    - I think the most we can say from this is an existence proof that relatively [[near analogies]] can frequently lead to quite innovative outcomes.

                    - Telling that I previously classified this study as "anecdotal"! Yikes... This was a rigorously done multiple-case-study analysis.

            - [[[[EVD]] - patents filed by inventors who was new to the patent's field tended to receive slightly fewer citations, except when they collaborated with an expert in the new field - [[@artsParadiseNoveltyLoss2018a]]]]

            - [[[[EVD]] - greater mean and max conceptual distance of cited inspirations was associated with lower probability of a concept being shortlisted across 12 social innovation design challenges - [[@chanBestDesignIdeas2015]]]]

    - Here is a more precise version: [[[[CLM]] - There is a 'Sweet Spot' in Analogical Distance. Somewhat far analogies lead to better creative outcomes than very near or very far analogies]]

        - this is [[SupportedBy]]

            - [[[[EVD]] - Molecular biologists with a reputation for innovation rarely used very far analogies in their lab meetings while generating novel scientific concepts; instead, they relied mainly on analogies to the same or other biological organisms - [[@dunbarHowScientistsThink1997]]]]

            - [[[[EVD]] - papers with high median conventionality and high tail atypical combinations of journals they cited were 2x more likely than average to be in top 5 percent of citation distribution - [[@uzziAtypicalCombinationsScientific2013]]]]

            - These are technically not analogies, but are somewhat relatinoal in that the stimulus words are verbs

    - Digging back into this was also substantively useful, for resurfacing the idea of "expertise mediation" as another spin on the [attribute problem]([[[[CLM]] - Core attribute (mis)matches mediate the benefits of analogies in real-world, complex problem solving]]): if I show you something from a far domain, and your understanding of that domain is shallow, it's not going to be very useful to you, probably even if it's quite thoroughly explained - what needs to happen is a fruitful iteration or co-evolution (a la [[@dorstCreativityDesignProcess2001]] and [[@helmsCompoundAnalogicalDesign2008]]) between your problem space and the other problem space

            - Important, important context here: the magnitude of the effect of being female is WAYYYYYY bigger than the effect of being technically distant. This might be a first-order approximation of the relative contributions of perspectives (roughly [[problem (re)formulation]]) and heuristics (roughly "direct transfer") of being "distant"/marginal from the domain

        - The [core result]([Solvers](((8JunxBU6A))) who chose to submit their solutions to the 2nd stage of an innovation contest and [self-rated themselves as more technically distant from the problem domain](((LtwnesPYh))) were slightly more likely to submit winning solutions for [Innocentive science problem solving contests](((OztGD5jl4)))) is often cited as an #example-of the phenomenon of [[outsider innovation]].

    - Other observations

        - Interesting to note here that the canonical [example]([[example-of]]) in the intro for [[outsider innovation]] ([[broadcast search]]) is the case of [[John Harrison]] solving the "longitude problem"

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FEly_CcbPL7.png?alt=media&token=8a402763-7005-429f-b085-8b61e9784a80)

            - Here, the long time lag (~[60 years!](John Harrison (an outsider to the field of astronomy) invented a new mechanical method to measuring longitude at sea in 1710. This method was different from the dominant astronomical approach. It took ~60 years for this innovation to be accepted by the board of longitude in 1770 (the core of the field), because he had to pass through barriers of legitimacy, including initial resistance from the astronomers and politicians (despite initial positive reception from the navy). This internal resistance was eventually overcome by external actors intervening, such as the royal society (which influenced the astronomers), and the monarchy (which influenced the politicians).)) and serious challenges John faced in getting his idea accepted (as discussed by [[@cattaniDeconstructingOutsiderPuzzle2017]])

            - This is really useful to think about with [[Matt Clancy]]: if there really is some kind of ["sweet spot"]([[[[CLM]] - There is a 'Sweet Spot' in Analogical Distance. Somewhat far analogies lead to better creative outcomes than very near or very far analogies]]) of analogical distance, it is actually possible that "near citations" are... more performative (or social / framing / narrative) than causal for the innovation itself

                - see, e.g., [[@cattaniInnovatorsActsFraming2020]]

                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FNi-B5MKcce.png?alt=media&token=4679efb3-3ba6-4cdd-8c20-2803c746af6a)

                    - what's interesting too is that there might be a tension in the other direction as well: under some conditions, it may be more advantageous to "dress up" your explanations of your innovation with far (perhaps more familiar?) analogies than were actually used to generate your idea (see [[@sanerAnalogiesOutBlue1999]])

                - more citations here:

                    - {{embed: Citations of [[@cattaniDeconstructingOutsiderPuzzle2017]] that might be relevant for us:}}

        - ALSO! Important to state here: we can't rule out the possibility that the solutions that ended up being proposed were "near" (drew primarily from domain knowledge or didn't involve outside concepts): so it could be that it was *ALL* perspectives, no heuristics. We can't tell.
[[February 15th, 2021]]

- Ok let's get into the zone by fleshing out [[[[QUE]] - How might domain distance modulate the effects of analogies on creative output?]]

    - Becoming quite clear to me that the question is far too broad to be useful. Seeing different effects on different variations of "creative outcomes", which wouldn't be super surprising from a theoretical standpoint (fundamentally different processes related to divergence and convergence, sort of like the [[dance between the theoretical and the evidential]])

“…This potential boost from working on the intervening task for creativity on the main task may be present only when individuals work on tasks within the same general domain and not when they engage in tasks that are in a different knowledge domain. Similar to previous studies on “near” and “far” analogies in design (Fu et al., [ref]), our results demonstrate that switching to an intervening task may be more beneficial to creativity when this task is at least in the same knowledge domain or not “too far” away from the main task.…”

Observing such tradeoffs, Fu et al (2013aFu et al ( , 2013b hypothesized that the stimuli from the "middle ground" may be desirable.

“…With regard to quality, although there is slight discrepancy among average quality, maximum quality and the percentage of ideas having higher quality, the results of the second row of Figure 4 show a negative correlation between analogical distance and the quality of ideas: Stimuli of closer analogical distance (Near-field) generally trigger the generation of ideas which are more effective and more capable of matching the design specification. This is consistent with the findings of Chan, Dow, and Schunn (2015) and Srinivasan et al (2018): also in this experiment the quality of generated ideas. as inspired by near-field analogies is better than the ones inspired by the far-field analogy and control conditions.…”

A similar study [6] concurs with this finding, but with the caveat that "conceptually closer, rather than farther sources appear more beneficial."

- And challenges my thinking about wanting to parse out the "intrinsic quality" of an idea (cf. against [[reception penalties]] in discussions of [[[[QUE]] - How might domain distance modulate the effects of analogies on creative output?]])

    - Intuitively I want to parse it out, but it may actually be... inextricable?

        - It's not just that "worse is better" helps with reception, but... it's also "better" in some deeper sense of fitness and usefulness. Said another way, "the right thing" is right in some narrow sense, but actually wrong/worse in a broader collection of important senses.

    - That said, it is still possible to break out different senses of reception penalties: some are more related to [[[[CLM]] - Prestige substantially controls how scientific ideas spread]]

    - second part of the paper is empirical quant analysis though, relating inventor (team) characteristics to p(outlier) in terms of novelty/distance from similar patents (so basically super novel above some threshold of quality?).

        - study 3: experiment (main one of interest, directly relevant results)

            - the main result of interest for our question is the correlation between the observed dependent variable of % far analogies: [[[[EVD]] - designs that were measured during an ideation session to have come from a higher percentage of far analogies were perceived as more original and valuable by potential customer judges - [[@dahlInfluenceValueAnalogical2002]]]]

                - it's an odd choice to control for expert judge effects by making them dummies, but... ok i guess? more sensible might be to aggregate the judgments somehow. the worst thing here is that the analysis seems to be at the judgment level, not even at the design level, and i don't understand how they would compute % far at that level??? and there are no corrections or attempts to model within-design (bc these are repeated measures) OR within-person (also repeated measures) dependencies

                - this is a weak result overall, imo. i would probably have complained as a reviewer, and asked to see degrees of freedom, and/or descriptives. the relatively high p value and small effect (with no measures of variability given) make me quite nervous.

                - in any case, it's really important to note here that the far analogies were *NOT* given to the designers in a controlled fashion as stimuli, as in [[@chanBenefitsPitfallsAnalogies2011]] and similar, BUT were observed and correlated with a suboptimal statistical modeling approach. so this is essentially an observational correlational result.

    - # Method

        - very similar to [[@dunbarHowScientistsThink1997]]'s [[m/s/In vivo]] method

        - sample: three ~70-90 min colloquia sessions (one speaker + ~30-60 audience members from department; all 3 speakers were senior researchers, well-known, two from other universities) in social psych, cognitive psych, and cognitive neuropsych + five ~70-90 min lab group meetings from two different lab groups (one in developmental psych with 10 scientists: two faculty, three postdocs, three graduate students, and two research assistants; one in cognitive psych, with 19 scientists: three faculty, six postdocs, five graduate students, and five research assistants), all at major research university in North America

            - core contrast between lab group meetings vs. colloquia  rests on assumption that lab group meetings are early/in-progress, vs. colloquia (late/finished, similar to historical record)

            - important to note here that there is a strong connection to research on the varying *functions* of [[analogy]]: sometimes for explanation and persuasion, and not for... actual problem solving? e.g., via direct transfer, influencing problem formulation, etc.

    - # Conclusions

        - Authors claim that these results (particularly the [contrast in use of far analogies]([[[[EVD]] - Far analogies were rare and never used in psychology lab group meetings for reasoning (vs. mere mentions); far analogies were rare in colloquia as well, but were frequently used for reasoning - [[@sanerAnalogiesOutBlue1999]]]]) between lab group meetings and colloqiua) support the claim that [[[[CL]] - [[far analogies]] are systematically overrated in their importance for creative breakthroughs due to memory bias - [[@dunbarHowScientistsThink1997]]]]

            - I am not so sure, though! This rests on the assumption that no discovery and conceptual work is happening in colloquia. Only reasoning that happens in lab groups counts as real. Can see this as defensible for analogies from the presenter: in colloquia you're presenting fully formed work. And the "use" measure But what about analogies from the audience that are between-domain? Could those be generative in some way?

                - This study can't tease that out though. Could *maybe* look only at audience-generated between-domain analogies and see if there's anything going on there. But probably too small N to say anything. Could be an interesting case study though!

                - In general I think the shape is fine: generally low proportions of far analogies, and generally low proportions of those used in actual reasoning.

        - [[[[EVD]] - Far analogies' effects on MechE students' novelty of ideas were different depending on timing: more novel ideas when seeing them after problem solving began vs. before - [[@tsengRoleTimingAnalogical2008]]]]

        - [[[[EVD]] - In general, MechE students' ideas when given near analogies were at least as novel, and sometimes moreso, then ideas generated with far analogies, or seeing nothing - [[@tsengRoleTimingAnalogical2008]]]]

        - [[[[EVD]] - Undergrad MechE students who saw near analogies (clocks) for a time-keeping problem preferred discrete (drip-based) solutions to continuous (e.g., flow/fill) solutions - [[@tsengRoleTimingAnalogical2008]]]]

            - this might be an example of [[🧱 fixation]], cc [[@janssonDesignFixation1991]] and [[@linseyStudyDesignFixation2010]]

    - # conclusions

        - on the basis of these results, the authors claim that timing, and specifically [[open goals]] determine [[[[QUE]] - What factors control whether people appropriately benefit from analogies (especially far-field ones) during creative problem solving?]]. Specifically, they claim that [[[[CLM]] - People are more likely to benefit from far analogies if they encounter them while they have an open goal - [[@tsengRoleTimingAnalogical2008]]]]

            - this finding has been replicated somewhat in our work with [[@siangliulueProvidingTimelyExamples2015]], although it is in tension with [[@kulkarniEarlyRepeatedExposure2012]]

            - this comes most from the work of [[@patalanoMemoryImpassesProblem1994]] [[@patalanoOpportunisticPlanningBeing1997]] and connects to the [[Zeigarnik effect]]

            - i think the more general claim here is that open goals can make it more likely that potentially beneficial stimuli will be noticed and processed in useful ways, even if there are normal barriers that might prevent this (such as in the case of far analogies, difficulties with mapping, etc.)

- [[@dahlInfluenceValueAnalogical2002]] for [[[[QUE]] - How might domain distance modulate the effects of analogies on creative output?]] | negative effect of being given one or more near analogies compared to nothing

    - revisiting this while synthesizing. the negative effect of being given one or more near analogies is worth separating out.

    - so, something like [[[[EVD]] - Engineering students who were given one or more near analogies as stimuli generated design ideas that were perceived as less original and valuable by potential customer judges, compared to being given no stimuli - [[@dahlInfluenceValueAnalogical2002]]]]

        - [concerns about the odd analysis choices](it's an odd choice to control for expert judge effects by making them dummies, but... ok i guess? more sensible might be to aggregate the judgments somehow. the worst thing here is that the analysis seems to be at the judgment level, not even at the design level, and i don't understand how they would compute % far at that level??? and there are no corrections or attempts to model within-design (bc these are repeated measures) OR within-person (also repeated measures) dependencies) still stand for this one

                - reminds me of that one paper on long paths. ugh can't remember atm.

                - one implication here is that [[far analogies]] seem more important than they really are because they are easier to remember than the "prosaic" incremental steps that are actually super important to the process

                    - Basically, [[Kevin Dunbar]] is claiming here that [[[[CL]] - [[far analogies]] are systematically overrated in their importance for creative breakthroughs due to memory bias - [[@dunbarHowScientistsThink1997]]]]

                - in particular, the idea of model organisms as analogies is very similar to the way [[analogy]] use is described as model-based reasoning in  [[@nersessianHybridAnalogiesConceptual2009]]

            - [[[[EVD]] - A molecular biologist who had made a major scientific conceptual change did not recall any of the spontaneous analogies used to enact that change - [[@dunbarHowScientistsThink1997]]]]

            - episode of major conceptual change involved chain of exclusively [[near analogies]] - noted here as an example of the primacy of relatively near analogies

        - ## analogy (focus on this)

            - [[[[EVD]] - Molecular biologists with a reputation for innovation rarely used very far analogies in their lab meetings while generating novel scientific concepts; instead, they relied mainly on analogies to the same or other biological organisms - [[@dunbarHowScientistsThink1997]]]]

                - i've often wondered if there's something fundamentally different about the way [[analogy]] works in science (for understanding) vs. invention (for problem solving); could far analogies be more important in the latter case? how does this jive with findings about [[interdisciplinarity]], such as with [[@uzziAtypicalCombinationsScientific2013]]? in those papers, i recall claims that the distance between the combinations is important, but i don't recall how this is tested.

            - Old draft

                - [molecular biologists](Participants and Setting: 25 scientists (ranging from technicians/grad students to postdocs to senior scientists) across 4 molecular biology labs from a single major university, all with a reputation for innovation) with a reputation for innovation rarely used [very far (nonbiological) analogies](((0mXe7k16u))) [in their lab meetings](((bARJ_fZPw))) (only [2 occurrences observed in total](((yzyBTj9So)))); when they were, they were used for explanation purposes. In contrast, analogies to other organisms occurred quite frequently (57 occurrences in total), and were used to generate hypotheses, design and fix experiments, and generate explanations. Analogies to the same organism also occurred quite frequently (40 occurrences in total), and were used primarily to generate explanations, with some other uses for hypothesis-generation, and experiment design/fixes.

    - Need to spec out calculus of how evidence and claims come to relate to one another

    - Feel reticent to "pollute" the space with claims. Would love to have a way to filter and separate out or sort through the ones that are "tested" and the ones that are speculative. The latter in particular can be very generative and useful, so I don't want to be afraid of creating them. But I want to be able to distinguish them, especially over time and if I can't be immersed in that problem area for the whole time.

    - Would like to be able to "drag and drop" evidence items to "refactor". Case study: I noticed a bunch of evidence notes opposing a claim: and then realize it makes sense to parse out a separate claim that these evidence notes support. How to specify this?

        - Option 1: Repeat. Leave the stuff in place, and start a new branch.

        - Option 2: Move/refactor. Move the stuff that relates to a specific claim and "collapse" them into it, and then use that claim as an opposition for the claim.

    - Another operation: refining of claims over time. Shades of this. Do I modify this, or branch it out? No easy and hard-and-fast answers, I think. Reticent to over-specify this.

        - I think a graphical/exploratory UX is probably needed in the beginning. A clean prose/paragraph representation is appropriate when understanding is mature, but feels too heavy for exploring in the beginning.

            - Exploratory sensemaking that is *generating* claims is potentially more immediately useful and exciting compared to a simpler case where you have one or more well-specific claims and evidence types that you're trying to just audit. We need to support this.

    - Idea for a prototyping UI: have a representation of the graph that "talks back to me" that I can see. What is latent in the graph based on what I'm writing in prose/outline, or on a map?

                - if farther, then something new is being brought in (direct transfer)

                - if nearer, then maybe it's more about novel problem framing that allows for novel combination of existing pieces

                - for now, we know this connects well to [[far analogies]] because ~96% of the novel combinations are cross-disciplinary. which... makes sense based on how they define it.

        - the measurement of impact in terms of the long run outcomes for a single paper seem... off to me. i want to know about field-wide changes. which i suppose is not really possible to glean from citation data, because they involve counterfactuals. maybe in some limited cases we can get some natural experiments to compare.

        - i keep thinking about relationships between this and [[literature-based discovery]]! which has a similar intuition about basically "undiscovered public knowledge" (undiscovered fruitful connections between things)

        - the results on delayed recognition and lower-impact factor REALLY throw a wrench in heuristics that focus on filtering papers based on "top-tier venues"

            - yeah you can recover by buzz making its way through the community post-hoc, but based on the dynamics laid out here, basically guarantees that you'll be like... 7 years behind the curve on new breakthroughs? in exchange for what? higher short-run throughput maybe?

            - how far does this extend? to workshop papers? "just books" (no peer-reviewed journal papers???)

                - see, e.g., this book on [[Naturalistic Decision-Making]]

            - my intuition is also that this *underestimates* the delayed recognition penalty, when accounting for other forces like active prestige differentials and so on

                - thinking of [[@morganPrestigeDrivesEpistemic2018]] and [[@cattaniDeconstructingOutsiderPuzzle2017]] and [[@gruberDarwinManPsychological1974]]

            - and i really wonder if things have changed now: this was for papers published in 2001; this was pre-Google Scholar, pre-BERT, and pre-Twitter - and throughout this time, my feeling is that the constricting forces of publish or perish have only gotten stronger

        - should really pay attention to the variance in these effects: how tight is the relationship? we know for sure that the variance in hits

            - it's hard/impossible to tease apart variance due to extraneous factors vs. variance due to intrinsic variation in the quality of hte outcome

            - woudl really want to dive into the highly novel combos that didn't pan out, and see what was going on

        - some questioning of the novelty measure in a later paper ([[@bornmannWeMeasureNovelty2019]])  comparing it to [[@uzziAtypicalCombinationsScientific2013]]'s measure in terms of correlation to [[F1000 Prime]] ratings of biomed papers: depending on how you slice it, this is a plus or minus, since one key result in Wang is the asymmetry between home vs. foreign impact, and these F1000 tags are for papers that get recommended
