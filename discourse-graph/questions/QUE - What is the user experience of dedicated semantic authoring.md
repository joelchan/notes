- Adding to [thread](This actually has a similar research goal as the [[P: COVID-19 treatment search]], centered around the [[Authorship Bottleneck]] (cc. [[[[CLM]] - The central bottleneck to synthesis infrastructures is authoring]])) on [[Authorship Bottleneck]]: [[[[QUE]] - What is the user experience of dedicated semantic authoring?]] and [[[[QUE]] - What is the user experience of semantic authoring within regular scholarly workflows?]]

    - [[@vigoComparingOntologyAuthoring2019]] interesting study of authoring [[m/Quantitative]] [[m/Log analysis]] of both [[m/s/Lab]], semi-controlled, and [[m/s/In vivo]] authoring of [[ontologies]] using the [[sys/Protege]] ontology authoring tool

    - [[@warrenUsingOntologies2014]]

    - Reminded that [[Andrea Thomer]] is working on this too! Studying taxonomy work, and trying to make the authoring experience better and more effective [[@thomerTransformingTaxonomicInterfaces2018]]

    - TONS Of tabs open in Chrome rn!

    - Also some stuff in zotero from [[May 20th, 2020]] from [this thread](Follow citation thread from [[@shipmanFormalityConsideredHarmful1999]] to see what we've done already ont his integration question. NOT tool development only, or description only, but studies of how we can __integrate__ standards and [[formality]] into existing workflows (and if not, how to sustainably change them))

    - Important nuances that define the gap we want to fill

        - **who** is the user?

        - **what** is the nature of the semantic authoring? ontology? data? metadata? and what kind of referents?

        - **why** (for what purpose) is the semantic authoring?

        - **where** is the work being done?

        - what kind of **data** do we have about the experience?

    - Started [[sys/Knovigator]] [quest](https://knovigator.com/quest/What-know-user-experience-semantic-authoring-science-scholarship-vo8n6wyo). Also doing something in parallel in [[sys/Fuse]]
