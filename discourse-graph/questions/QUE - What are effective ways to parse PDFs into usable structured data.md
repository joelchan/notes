- This ([[PDF parsing]]) [problem]([[[[QUE]] - What are effective ways to parse PDFs into usable structured data?]]) was and remains a huge bottleneck. Without some kind of semantics behind it, we continue to have the problem of [[Disembeddedness]] with annotations and lossy [[compression]]. I'm thinking of basically all [[annotation]] approaches now, including [[sys/Hypothes.is]], which completely strip the excerpt from its [[context]]

    - the [[IBM Research]] folks have followed up on this work quite well, see, e.g., #[[@gentilePersonalizedKnowledgeGraphs2019]]
[[Grant proposal for Synthesis Infrastructure - NSF CHS  SOS 2020]]
