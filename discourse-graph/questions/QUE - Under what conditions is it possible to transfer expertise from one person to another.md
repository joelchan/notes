- # Synthesis

    - sociotechnical roles

        - [[@ackermanAnswerGardenMerging1996]] has technical design patterns for gracefully escalating from local-first experts to broader organizational-level experts, as well as anonymity mechanisms (no evidence notes, but [trails to past ones](key learnings from the first two field studies of [[sys/Answer Garden]] are super releveant: we [should read]([[➰ breadcrumbs]]). that's where the evidence is. but the claim basically is that [context is necessary to make information useful]([[[[CLM]] - Knowledge must be recontextualized to be usefully reused]]), and often it's best to get that context from a person. this is the major motivation for maknig the answer garden not just a repo, but also a help-seeking platform))

                - Case Study/Experiment

                - Case Study of making pizza was not in this paper, despite being cited. We tracked it down to [[@darrAcquisitionTransferDepreciation1995]], but even here it's not actually a result, but a contrived example

                    - Harder to share how to hand-toss a pizza (tacit) than to share the cook time of different pizza (explicit)

                    - Experts usually only tell part of the story (explicit part) about task that require tacit knowledge (hand-tossing a pizza)

            - [[expert blind spot]] aka [[curse of knowledge]] - can't just ask people

                    - Citation statements from the book

                        - Case Study/Experiment

                        - Experts' lists less specific steps than novice.

                        - Experts oversimplified the steps and methods (abstracting the tasks) in order to process information rapidly and view task holistically.

                        - This make it harder to transfer knowledge

                    - Citation statements from the book

                        - Case Study/Experiment

                        - Experiment about completing an electronic circuits

                        - Expert provide more simplified and abstract (less concrete) instructions to the novices than those with less expertise.

                        - Novices often perform better with instruction from those with less expertise.

                - [[@hindsCurseExpertiseEffects1999]]

                    - Case Study/Experiment

                    - Expert often underestimate novice performance times. (They think novice perform faster than they do)

                    - Expert have difficulty recalling their ability when they were novice. (They have difficulty recalling how little they knew as novice)

                    - They attempt to anchor their previous performance and other performance based on their current expert performance. They would adjust down from this anchor to predict novices.

                    - Because of inaccurate memories of their own novice performance, they often overestimate their ability as novice.

                    - Availability bias and Anchoring

                    - Case Study/Experiment

                    - Expert vs Novice in electronic repair.

                    - Expert tends to view the electronic devices as a system of components and follow abstract conceptual model of the way the device work. (more abstract and conceptual)

                    - Novice tends to use trail-and-error procedure and see see the device as unrelated parts.

                    - Instructions on how to order a series of abstract shapes

                    - Experts uses more abstract idiosyncratic language than those with less expertise when explaining to others.

                    - This might not be published

                    - Case Study/Experiment

                    - Student estimating company earnings

                    - Student were not able to ignore their current knowledge when making the estimates.

                    - The knowledge of the company biases these student to their own knowledge hence having a harder time trying to guess prediction of uninformed subjects.

                    - The curse of knowledge make it difficult for expertise to bridge with novice because "they have difﬁculty imagining ever having been so ill-informed on the topic and accurately imagining the information that novices might not know."

                    - Feedback does not change the expert (student with knowledge about the company) estimate of company earnings and they were anchor to their original knowledge.

                    - Anchoring

                - [[@adelsonWhenNovicesSurpass1984]]

                    - Case Study/Experiment

                    - Experts vs Novice in Programming Tasks

                    - expert uses more conceptually based representation (abstract)

                    - novice uses syntactically based representations (concrete)

                - This probably has implications for how we elicit the knowledge to add to our wiki - how do we create the conditions where they can be specific?

        - [[[[CLM]] - Knowledge is fundamentally contextual]]

            - [[@laveSituatedLearningLegitimate1991]]

                - Knowledge is embedded so it is difficult to extract.

                - It is embedded in a context (place, people, situation)

            - [[@singleyTransferCognitiveSkill1989]]

                - Book

                - Knowledge transfer will be greater if the tasks are more similar.

                - There can be negative transfer when the context of the tasks does not match.

        - people may be resistant to knowledge from outside their speciality (cc [[[[QUE]] - How might domain distance modulate the effects of analogies on creative output?]])

            - [[@hindsLayingGroundworkRole2001]]

                - Case Study/Experiment

                - Employee were resistant to transfer knowledge that require adaption from original context to a new context within a consumer products organization

            - [[@argoteLearningCurvesManufacturing1990]]

                - Case Study/Experiment

                - Managers were reluctant to seek knowledge from other plant, arguing that they are not relevant to their operations in truck assembly plants.
