- # Synthesis

    - sociotechnical roles

        - [[@ackermanAnswerGardenMerging1996]] has technical design patterns for gracefully escalating from local-first experts to broader organizational-level experts, as well as anonymity mechanisms (no evidence notes, but [trails to past ones](key learnings from the first two field studies of [[sys/Answer Garden]] are super releveant: we [should read]([[➰ breadcrumbs]]). that's where the evidence is. but the claim basically is that [context is necessary to make information useful]([[[[CLM]] - Knowledge must be recontextualized to be usefully reused]]), and often it's best to get that context from a person. this is the major motivation for maknig the answer garden not just a repo, but also a help-seeking platform))

                - Case Study/Experiment

                - Case Study of making pizza was not in this paper, despite being cited. We tracked it down to [[@darrAcquisitionTransferDepreciation1995]], but even here it's not actually a result, but a contrived example

                    - Harder to share how to hand-toss a pizza (tacit) than to share the cook time of different pizza (explicit)

                    - Experts usually only tell part of the story (explicit part) about task that require tacit knowledge (hand-tossing a pizza)

            - [[expert blind spot]] aka [[curse of knowledge]] - can't just ask people

                - [[@langerWhenPracticeMakes1979]]

                    - Citation statements from the book

                        - Case Study/Experiment

                        - Experts' lists less specific steps than novice.

                        - Experts oversimplified the steps and methods (abstracting the tasks) in order to process information rapidly and view task holistically.

                        - This make it harder to transfer knowledge

                - [[@hindsBotheredAbstractionEffect2001]]

                    - Citation statements from the book

                        - Case Study/Experiment

                        - Experiment about completing an electronic circuits

                        - Expert provide more simplified and abstract (less concrete) instructions to the novices than those with less expertise.

                        - Novices often perform better with instruction from those with less expertise.

                - [[@hindsCurseExpertiseEffects1999]]

                    - Case Study/Experiment

                    - Expert often underestimate novice performance times. (They think novice perform faster than they do)

                    - Expert have difficulty recalling their ability when they were novice. (They have difficulty recalling how little they knew as novice)

                    - They attempt to anchor their previous performance and other performance based on their current expert performance. They would adjust down from this anchor to predict novices.

                    - Because of inaccurate memories of their own novice performance, they often overestimate their ability as novice.

                    - Availability bias and Anchoring

                - [[@gitomerIndividualDifferencesTechnical1988]]

                    - Case Study/Experiment

                    - Expert vs Novice in electronic repair.

                    - Expert tends to view the electronic devices as a system of components and follow abstract conceptual model of the way the device work. (more abstract and conceptual)

                    - Novice tends to use trail-and-error procedure and see see the device as unrelated parts.

                    - Instructions on how to order a series of abstract shapes

                    - Experts uses more abstract idiosyncratic language than those with less expertise when explaining to others.

                    - This might not be published

                - [[@camererCurseKnowledgeEconomic1989]]

                    - Case Study/Experiment

                    - Student estimating company earnings

                    - Student were not able to ignore their current knowledge when making the estimates.

                    - The knowledge of the company biases these student to their own knowledge hence having a harder time trying to guess prediction of uninformed subjects.

                    - The curse of knowledge make it difficult for expertise to bridge with novice because "they have difﬁculty imagining ever having been so ill-informed on the topic and accurately imagining the information that novices might not know."

                    - Feedback does not change the expert (student with knowledge about the company) estimate of company earnings and they were anchor to their original knowledge.

                    - Anchoring

                - [[@adelsonWhenNovicesSurpass1984]]

                    - Case Study/Experiment

                    - Experts vs Novice in Programming Tasks

                    - expert uses more conceptually based representation (abstract)

                    - novice uses syntactically based representations (concrete)

                - This probably has implications for how we elicit the knowledge to add to our wiki - how do we create the conditions where they can be specific?

        - [[[[CLM]] - Knowledge is fundamentally contextual]]

            - [[@laveSituatedLearningLegitimate1991]]

                - Knowledge is embedded so it is difficult to extract.

                - It is embedded in a context (place, people, situation)

            - [[@singleyTransferCognitiveSkill1989]]

                - Book

                - Knowledge transfer will be greater if the tasks are more similar.

                - There can be negative transfer when the context of the tasks does not match.

        - people may be resistant to knowledge from outside their speciality (cc [[[[QUE]] - How might domain distance modulate the effects of analogies on creative output?]])

            - [[@hindsLayingGroundworkRole2001]]

                - Case Study/Experiment

                - Employee were resistant to transfer knowledge that require adaption from original context to a new context within a consumer products organization

            - [[@argoteLearningCurvesManufacturing1990]]

                - Case Study/Experiment

                - Managers were reluctant to seek knowledge from other plant, arguing that they are not relevant to their operations in truck assembly plants.

    - semi-structured interviews with 24 informants (21 users and 3 managers) who use the CAD system HP ME30 in the general fields of architecture, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and industrial design, across seveon companies of varying sizes. All informants had used the CAD system for at least five years.

        - something intersting to keep in mind when we read those papers, is to consider how their users compare to ours. interesting obseration cited here is that in many cases people did *not* need context.
