    - Description

        - Want to specifically distinguish from endpoint of jump-starting collaborations, but instead ok with endpoint of success being learning or knowledge transfer, a la [[@laneEngineeringSerendipityWhen]]'s finding about [knowledge transfer effects from matched interactions](scientist pairs who were [randomly assigned to talk to each other](((Dvg9ncop6))) (and did so, face-to-face) at an [interdisciplinary medical imaging symposium](((HvQgkhAIF))) used about 6 new [MeSH keywords from their partners in future publications](((08vh79BF1))) when the pair had [moderate overlap in intellectual interests](((_eEx8ZIIv))), compared to low or high overlap (for which there were no clear effects))

            - So carefully distinguish from work on [[synthesis centers]], and also [[science of team science]]
