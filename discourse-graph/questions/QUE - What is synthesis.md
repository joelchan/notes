    - Description

        - [[Z: Synthesis is a creative act]]

            - [[[[CLM]] - Synthesis is creating a new whole out of component parts]]

            - So the new thing should have properties that the mere sum of the parts doesn't. But what properties? We think the core idea is that [[[[CL]] - Clearer cases of synthesis involve substantial conceptual innovation]]

                - [[Z: Theories are core examples of synthesis]]

                - [[Z: Design spaces are core examples of synthesis]]

                - [[Z: Frames are core examples of synthesis]]

                - Consider the difference between these two "summaries" of a set of papers:

                    - {{table}}

                        - Example

                            - A

                                - B

                        - Related work for systems paper

                            - There are a few ways to solve problem X. One is <method1> [1,2]. People have also tried <method2> [3,4,5]. Finally, others have tried <method3> [6,7,8]. In this paper, we introduce <method4>.

                                - The earliest attempts to solve problem X took the angle of <method1> [1,2]. But it has limitations ABC. For example, [1] showed that... To address limitations ABC, others have explored the possibility of <method2> [3,4,5], which makes key modifications XYZ to <method1>. This yields some gains under settings DD, but doesn't work in settings EE. The overarching open problem seems to be the tradeoff between XXX (common in settings EE) and the side effect BB of <method2>. To address this open problem, researchers are exploring <method3> [6,7,8]. <method3> has shown some promise, yielding X% gains in settings EE; but a remaining open problem is YY. In this paper, we build on these efforts by addressing this key limitation.

                        - Darwin's theory of evolution

                            - Species vary: some variations are bad, and some help with survival. Species struggle to survive. Some, but not all, organisms pass on new offspring.

                                - Species struggle to survive. Species also vary, and some variations are good and some are bad for survival. Therefore, one precondition for species to survive and pass on offspring is by having or inheriting beneficial variations. This variation and selection process explains how we get the diversity of species we see today.

                        - Weighing the bulk of the evidence (aka meta-analysis / [[systematic review]])

                            - cc [[[[CLM]] - [[systematic review]]s are typically narrowly focused, and provide less insight]]

                        - Judgment

                    - 14: Application and program development (p. 354)

                    - 15: Assemblages (p. 354)

            - Examples of Synthesis

                - {{query: {and: [[example-of]] [[synthesis]]}}}

        - Counterexamples

            - We can also look at examples of intellectual acts that do not seem to produce something more than the sum of their parts.

                - Classic undifferentiated list, as noted in #[[@holbrookLevelsSuccessUse2008]] and others.

                    - So, idea of "parts, not whole"? Assemblage? Can't transcend the sum of the parts. Or might not even have the sum.

                    - The idea of a conceptually new whole construction is in contrast with what we often see in related work sections and literature reviews, which are much more about assemblage, often listing in chronological or author-order, what things have been done, what topics have been covered, with little to no synthesis into a coherent new whole.

                        - In this vein, [[systematic review]]s can be construed as a narrow subset of [[synthesis]] (and literature reviewing)

                            - It's not just that they're more easily done in well-structured domains where we have a bit more agreement.

                            - It's also that these [[systematic review]]s and meta-analyses are often laser-focused on just one edge in a causal model!

                                - Granted, good reviews (especially [[m/meta-analysis]]) might try to estimate some of the variability, but they're rarely focused on explicating a causal model or larger whole.

                                    - Especially in medicine (e.g., [[Cochrane systematic reviews]]), the goal is more about getting a really good handle on what the evidence can say about a very narrowly defined question.

                        - #Thought-Fragment Additionally, the [[IVEO Matrix]] isn't quite where we want it to be yet: it's more of a meta-analysis or [[systematic review]], rather than a coherent new whole. There is no causal model or graph that ties it all together to support sophisticated reasoning and decision-making

        - this one in particular has some really nice reflections on the notion of a [[deductive chain]] that precedes hypothesis testing - a lot of the core activities that help strengthen the deductive chain can be thought of as [[synthesis]]

            - this pairs nicely with [[@vanrooijTheoryTestHow2021]] in specifying heuristics and moves for theory-building, which... I think is a nice fit for [[[[PTN]] - discourse graph]] and [[context queries]]

                - how nice if we had tools and systems (with data!) that allowed us to explore these, in a somewhat analogous way to photoshop (exploring variants), simulations, statistical software, and other tools for thought.

                - what are the tools for synthesis?

                    - as I've said in the past [[[[CLM]] - Effective individual synthesis systems (seem to mostly) exist (for a select few)]]

                        - the critical problem, though is this: because they're so individual, everyone is effectively an island. what if you don't have?

                        - a small exception, again, is sofware for [[systematic review]]s, but again, this doesn't solve our problem, bc so much [[synthesis]] that we want to do goes far beyond [[RCT]]s

                            - plus, they're often, afaict, "use once", not really supporting [[interoperability]] [[@oconnorStillMovingAutomation2019]] and [[reuse]] [[@blakeCollaborativeInformationSynthesis2006a]]
[[May 19th, 2020]]

- For [[JCDL]], we need to really sharply articulate what we mean by synthesis. Let's start a new question for that. [[[[QUE]] - What is synthesis?]] That is something we should develop. Can also prune single tags for synthesis. Becoming unmanageable.

    - Reviewing quickly also [[@strikeTypesSynthesisTheir1983]], the first necessary condition is that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. This could be quite a simple bar to clear, and they even include something as simple as a generalization as a synthesis, albeit a "low/unclear" form. The ["higher"/harder forms](Harder: ((-Pdz5e5m_)), ((_cIRupmm-)), ((w9aNIYgU5)), ((UFzZnNqFE)), ((UxD1YQjsZ)), ((eWor9m7Fq))) have higher levels of "conceptual innovation" (read: higher levels of generativity?)

    - Quick thoughts on [[Jodi Schneider]]'s stuff: building an argument representation from a collection of texts is an #example-of [[synthesis]] in the sense that it affords a new ability to generate inferences (it's similar in that way to a theory or causal model, or a design space)

- Working on fleshing out #[[[[QUE]] - What is synthesis?]]

    - Basic intuition of whole > parts is there. Clearly a necessary condition. But it's a low bar. Hard part is clarifying the higher levels / clearer cases of [[synthesis]] we ultimately want to support.
[[May 28th, 2020]]

- More on the thread of #[[[[QUE]] - What is synthesis?]]

    - Specifically re: #[[Z: Theories are core examples of synthesis]], it will be valuable to build on what #[[@strikeTypesSynthesisTheir1983]] do to talk through a few canonical examples of [[synthesis]] through the paper to illustrate/speculate what kinds of standards/affordances of information objects would facilitate the creation of those artifacts, as well as how they might be impaired without those affordances. The interesting thing about this is that, at least in the case of [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of evolution, we have some nice evidence from his notebook (cf. #[[@gruberDarwinManPsychological1974]])!

        - We can start with a nice example of a theory that I should be more familiar with than I am: [[Prospect Theory]]. I want to understand it, but also analyze its properties in detail as an example of synthesis. #[[R: kahnemanProspectTheoryAnalysis1979]]

            - Side note: want to be careful that this doesn't devolve into "synthesis = science". It is certainly an absolutely __essential__ component of science. But is not the only component of science (at least if you're a strong empiricist :)).

                - Nevertheless, I think we can safely make the strong claim that [[[[CLM]] - Scientific fields stall without adequate theoretical synthesis]]

        - Can also think of what other core examples of theories we can think about.

        - My instincts tell me that a running example based on Darwin's Theory of Evolution is the best place to start.

            - The notebooks are available

            - And there is basically universal consensus that the resulting [[synthesis]] is "good" (a gross understatement)

            - ~40% of the pages in [[Darwin's notebooks]] are excised  [[[[EVD]] - Almost half of the pages in Darwin's notebooks were excised - [[@herbertRedNotebookCharles1980]]]]

                - speaks to the nonlinearity [[compression]] and [[compositionality]]

            - It's also an interesting example because of how little Darwin had to build on in terms of previous "literature" compared to today (not 100% sure that's true, but that's my impression)!

                - And we can ask: is it possible for today's scientists and scholars to do work like this, with the increasing [[Burden of Knowledge]]? How might we build scholarly [[infrastructure]]s to enable this?

    - I'm now wondering if we need to transform the problem of [[WP: TOCHI Requirements framework for synthesis systems]] to the simpler case of "data models" for individual synthesis. And then once that is clear, think about how it might generalize to the sharing / collaborative case? I don't even know if we fully understand the **principles** for individual synthesis yet (might be a reason that #[[[[CLM]] - Effective individual synthesis systems (seem to mostly) exist (for a select few)]]: we don't have clear ways to decide, so other factors like convenience and marketing win, and people leave too much on the table). Let's solve that first, maybe?

        - Then we can add the 1+N case (collaborative, team), and see how the set of requirements changes.

            - We might ask: what (packages of) elements of individual synthesis are shareable? We know that [[[[CLM]] - Most private annotations aren't useful to other people]]

        - Then scale up to harder levels of [[reuse]]

        - Along these lines, we need to think very carefully about #[[Z: Sensemaking models partially model scholarly synthesis as of [[April 21st, 2020]]]] and #[[[[CLM]] - Synthesis is sensemaking on "hard mode"]], because that will probably be our first place to look to derive principles of the **data models** for systems that support synthesis.

            - Although efforts like #[[@russellBeingLiterateLarge2006]] and #[[@russellCostStructureSensemaking1993]] and #[[@pirolliSensemakingProcessLeverage2005]] seem to target more **__process__**-level frictions, and not as much the data model / artifacts themselves.

                - Slight exception from #[[@russellBeingLiterateLarge2006]]: Good example on p5: if "moving" a paper is costly, people do it a lot less

[[February 3rd, 2021]]

- Integrate stuff from [[[[QUE]] - What is synthesis?]] into [this section](Beyond operating at the claim level, however, our researcher will need to work through a range of **contextual details**. For example, to judge which studies and findings/theories are "actually applicable" (e.g.,, studying similar populations, interventions, settings, or outcome measures?) to her setting, she might need to reason over the fact that two studies that concluded limited efficacy of bans had ban interventions that were quite short, on a forum with no identity verification. Or she might reason through the fact that a prominent theory of bad faith and discourse was proposed by a philosopher from the early 2000's (before the rise of modern social media). To judge the validity of past findings (e.g., what has been established with sufficient certainty, where the frontier might be), she would need to know, for example, which findings came from which measures (e.g., self-report, behavioral measures), and the extent to which findings have been replicated cross authors from different labs, and across a variety of settings.) to help build intuition for what is really needed to enable synthesis

    - Lots of good text also in [[P: Synthesis requirements theory paper]] and many related pages (damn, been marinating this for awhile)

        - See especially: systems will hinder/limit the level of [[synthesis]] to the extent that they limit one or more of these affordances.
