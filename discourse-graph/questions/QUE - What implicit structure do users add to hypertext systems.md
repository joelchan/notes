        - Summary

            - > In this paper, we examine implicit structures that do not rely on system interpretation of content, but rather on interpretation of spatial context. The structures that we are concerned with are freewheeling, although they are often subject to authors’ visual conventions or self-imposed layout constraints. These structures are conveyed graphically, in a manner often orthogonal to a hypertextual framework (pg. 218).

            - > Our results indicate that (1) recognition of implicit structures in spatial hypertext is feasible, (2) interaction will be important in guiding such recognition, and (3) the hypertext system can provide layout facilities that will render later systematic interpretation much easier. Found structures can be used as a basis for supporting information management, as a straightforward way of promoting knowledge-base evolution, as a way of solving representational problems endemic to many hypertext systems, or as a basis for collaboration or interaction. (pg. 217)

    - Discussion/implications

        - Spatialized text allows connections between objects to be defined later, reducing the problem of premature structure. [[[[CLM]] - (premature) formalism considered harmful]]

        - Implicit structure from spatialized text reduces common representational problems (i.e. is this a node or a link? is this part of an object or an object itself?).

            - > In practice, people experience difficulty trying to articulate why they’ve linked two things (or even deciding if what they’re trying to express is a node or a link) [Ship93]. But they are accustomed to arranging text in space, both in computational media and, if somewhat less facilely, in the physical world. Computational tools like text editors, structured graphics editors, outliners, hypertext systems, and even multiple window displays (where different documents or different portions of the same document can be juxtaposed) all support spatialized text. Sometimes links are noted graphically in these media -- lines are drawn from one piece of text to another, or boxes group several textual items -- but often interconnections are left implicit; ambiguities in interpretation area desired consequence of not defining links explicitly. Many current hypertext linking mechanisms have no simple way of expressing ambiguity or lack of certainty -- “this node may be part of this structure, or it may be part of its neighbor.” But such uncertainty can be conveyed using spatial relationships such as distance and collocation, as it is in some automatic content-based clustering algorithms. (pg. 219)

        - Spatialized text structures help collaborators get up-to-speed and promote mutual intelligibility, which helps collaborative knowledge organization.

        - Implicit structure helps support simple and repetitive information management tasks, like ongoing re-organization.

            - Seeing as most people view refactoring notes as a cost, adding a spatial recognition algorithm to knowledge management tools could reduce friction of reusing old notes. [[[[CLM]] - Specifying context for future reuse is costly]]
