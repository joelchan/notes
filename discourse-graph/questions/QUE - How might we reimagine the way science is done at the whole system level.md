- What if this "alt-academia" / independent research thing were the norm, and not the exception? Is that possible? #[[Question]] #idea [[[[QUE]] - How might we reimagine the way science is done at the whole system level?]]

    - It's possible that no path exists to a better ecosystem for science through the current system. But in any case, it would be highly transformative to construct a roadmap and focused effort to try to get there, whether it's through burning bridges and siphoning off the many people who have left academia because [[[[CLM]] - Prevailing incentives in academia are bad for science]] (e.g., Blogpost by [[James Heathers]] about leaving academia [[@heathersQuit2020]] )

    - A vision for this might also come from [[tools for conviviality]]: instead of thinking about constructing an industrialized system, envision a system that is convivial, that empowers each person with maximal freedom to contribute to the advancement of scientific knowledge.
