            - Abstract

                - Traditionally, we think of 'mind' as something in the head or brain. But when one studies scientists and inventors, one quickly realizes that much of their cognition is distributed in the world. This paper applies a cognitive framework to a fine-grained analysis of the invention of the telephone, in which we look closely at a series of Bell's experiments and show how his devices serve as representations of his intentions and understandings. This kind of analysis also establishes that, although Bell and his chief rival, Elisha Gray, built devices that appeared similar, their representations of their function and potential were different.
