        - Abstract

            - This paper seeks to draw generalized profiles of a scientist and a social scientist as an information user. The profilts are based rrpon the results of a selection of science user studies and the Investigation into Information Requirements of the Social Sciences (INFROSS). The problems encountered in comparind user studies are discussed. On the whole scientists and social scientists do not differ to any large extent in their information seeking behaviour. They both use similar information sources, similiar methods to retrieve information and both experience similiar problems in dealing with information. However, the extent of use of different methods and the degrees of problem created do vary and account for the differences in the information seeking behaviour of scientists and social scientists.
