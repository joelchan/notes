- [[Notes]]

    - Task:

    - - Over 15 rounds, search for oil fields in a virtual desert

    - - After each round, you see the history of places you've searched as well as their payoffs (unambigous feedback, similar to Boudreau and Lakhani; this might be a key enabling condition for these effects)

    - - Also see history and payoffs of 3 "collaborators" in a network (4 efficient [decentralized] and 4 inefficient [centralized]

    - Findings:

    - - Average performance is higher in networked vs independent collectives

    - - Average performance is higher in efficient vs inefficient networks

    - - Players explore more in efficient networks (because players are more likely to copy neighbors in the same location, and players are more likely to be in the same location as neighbors in efficient networks)

        - Abstract

            - Complex problems in science, business, and engineering typically require some tradeoff between exploitation of known solutions and exploration for novel ones, where, in many cases, information about known solutions can also disseminate among individual problem solvers through formal or informal networks. Prior research on complex problem solving by collectives has found the counterintuitive result that inefficient networks, meaning networks that disseminate information relatively slowly, can perform better than efficient networks for problems that require extended exploration. In this paper, we report on a series of 256 Web-based experiments in which groups of 16 individuals collectively solved a complex problem and shared information through different communication networks. As expected, we found that collective exploration improved average success over independent exploration because good solutions could diffuse through the network. In contrast to prior work, however, we found that efficient networks outperformed inefficient networks, even in a problem space with qualitative properties thought to favor inefficient networks. We explain this result in terms of individual-level explore-exploit decisions, which we find were influenced by the network structure as well as by strategic considerations and the relative payoff between maxima. We conclude by discussing implications for real-world problem solving and possible extensions.
