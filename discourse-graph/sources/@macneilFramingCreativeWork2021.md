        - Abstract

            - Problem framing—the process of defining a problem—has been described by many researchers and designers as the crux of the design process. However, novice designers struggle with problem framing. To better understand this process and the potential for scaffolding, we conducted two studies. In the first study, we analyzed 41 problem statements from an introductory design course and found that novices often omit key information, like the primary stakeholder or the obstacles they face. To get novices to reflect on and include necessary design information, we created a tool called ProbLib that cues novices to explicitly reflect on aspects of the problem such as the stakeholders. To evaluate this approach, we conducted a between-subjects study (N=73) to compare ProbLib with an unstructured open text form. We found that participants using ProbLib wrote higher quality statements, included more information, and were more confident about specifying design needs. We observed creative behaviors such as brainstorming and analogical reasoning.

- Effective problem formulation is one of the most important aspects of the creative tasks ([[@goelStructureDesignProblem1992]]) such as design ([[@dorstFrameInnovationCreate2015]], [[@kolkoExposingMagicDesign2007]], [[@patonBriefingAndReframing2011]], [[@macneilFramingCreativeWork2021]]).

    - [[[[CLM]] - Effective problem formulation is-necessary-for creative knowledge work]]

    - Q: What's the difference between creative knowledge work and creative tasks? Is creative knowledge work particularly for research? Is design one kind of knowledge work?

        - ^^[[From: [[Joel Chan]]]]: [[@[[Jason Ding]]]] yeah, design is one kind of creative knowledge work. I like to add the term "knowledge" to emphasize the conceptual aspect, rather than the artifact itself as the output; e.g., in design, I care less that you made a thing that works really well, and more that you've created a new understanding of how to approach or solve a particular problem, that others can build on. It's possible to make a thing that works really well by simple trial and error or brute force search, and have no idea how it works.^^

- **Clear (cognitive / process) model of problem formulation** One thing we need is a clear idea of what constitutes problem reformulation for people. What do people do? [[[[QUE]] - How do people effectively (re)formulate creative problems?]]. We need this so that we don't fall into the trap of just automating problem formulation. ^^Jason: Yes, our previous work [[@macneilFramingCreativeWork2021]] could contribute to that discussion.^^

    - One insight I want to make sure we write down is that problem reformulation isn't a task that happens in isolation. Instead there is co-evolution with "solution processes"; see, e.g., [[[[CLM]] - Design proceeds by co-evolution of problem and solution space]]

        - This implies that it is probably not only hard, but maybe even incoherent to try to do this task in isolation.

        - So one #[[➰ breadcrumbs]] here is to articulate a few coherent examples of problem formulation, ideally in real-world scenarios

            - Starting points:

                - [[@dorstCreativityDesignProcess2001]] and [[@schonReflectivePractitionerHow1983]]

    - Once we understand the pieces, of what people do, and what inputs and outputs they have, and when in the process this happens, we can start to decompose into coherent subtasks for AI. ^^Jason: Exactly, and I strongly recommend to talk to [[Stephen MacNeil]] who has worked on problem framing (with me) over the past three years.^^

        - Again, taking a "[[distributed cognition]]" lens to this.

        - I think this is ultimately where we want to get to: an understanding of the design problem of AI-assisted problem reformulation. Not autonomous problem reformulation, but AI-assisted or augmented.

            - One of the subtasks, to be sure, is to get a feeling for how to evaluate the outputs of the models. But to do that before we have a clear sense of what their *task* is, seems... backwards. We don't have to have a *complete* model, but we do need to have at least some plausible starting points.

    - This is a big task, however. Our focus here is on [analogical problem reformulation]([[[[CLM]] - Analogies can power creative breakthroughs by stimulating effective problem (re)formulation]])
