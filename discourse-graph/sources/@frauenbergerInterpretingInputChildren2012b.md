        - Abstract

            - Involving children in the design process of interactive technology can greatly enhance its likelihood of successful adoption. However, children's input and ideas require careful interpretation to reach viable designs and technical specifications, which poses a significant challenge to an adult design research team. In this paper we discuss our approach to managing the complexity of combining concepts and ideas that were generated through participatory design work with the practical, technical, ethical and theoretical constraints of developing a technologically enhanced learning environment for children with and without Autism Spectrum Conditions. We found that the nature of this design problem did not lend itself to be rationally reduced to produce a single solution, but required an understanding of interpretive and speculative approaches for us to be able to cope with the complexity of requirements. We describe a workshop in which members of the design team used such approaches to develop a design brief that is faithful to the children's input. By making this process transparent, we aim to contribute to the methodology of using such designerly approaches in combination with participatory and human-centred methods to develop interactive technology.

                - good label for this is stakeholders - recognizing the multiple, potentially competing stakeholders that might overwrite the voice of the "primary stakeholders"

            - tension again with level of interpretation and faithfulness

While in other contexts, the contribution of participants is more tangible, as they are directly co-designing the output, **the given context did not allow for this immediacy, and it fell to the designers to ensure that the input from our participants was upheld and shaped the outcome**.

    - GOAL of Echoes that has direct relevance/impact on Democratizing Design:

    - "The overall approach to designing such a learning environment for a user population that has varying abilities was to **__evolve a participatory process that could include a range of children as design partners from early concept development through to prototyping and evaluation__**." p. 2378  Followed the process below.

    - **Foundation:** - building lasting relationships and initial observations;

        - [[**BUILDING RAPPORT**]]

        - "language games" to develop empathy and [[**BUILDING RAPPORT**]] p. 2384

    - **Inspire:** - creative design activities facilitating outside-the-box thinking,

    - **Listen:** - capturing and interpreting input and translating it into a design, and,

    - **Evaluate:** - testing design ideas with the participants.

    - **Focusing on the [Q: What tension points exist between the goals of diversity and depth of user participation in participatory design?]**

    - [[beth note]] I want to put these first two under [[**Logistics**]]

    - The team has to be "agile enough to respond to unpredictable issues as they arose, particularly as **__working with demanding school schedules necessitates pragmatic flexibility__**." p. 2378

    - Have to work within existing context constraints -- like a school or other formal education environment:

    - Had to set up meetings with teachers "to provide a meaningful context for participation and **__avoided placing unnecessary demands on teaching schedules__**"

    - **Role of the co-design participant **may influence the type of tension or challenge that the design team faces. Every role a child assumes in the "onion model" has inherent challenges:

    - > "Neither of these roles is without its problems. As testers, children have no direct means to of creatively contributing to the development, and are therefore restricted to giving feedback on artefacts that were created based on adult assumptions. At the other end of the scale, as full design partners children may be exposed to undue pressure to act as designers without possessing the necessary skills and intuition that most trained designers will have gained over many years of problem solving."

    - The tension between addressing the gap in perspective and context through participation, and the danger of building up undue expectations in terms of creative contribution to the design has troubled many design efforts in this field

    - **Content knowledge or 'ability' conundrum**: "__often there is a gap between the contributions from young design partners and the realities of designing a technological artefact, particularly when the children have special needs__"

    - cf the "conundrum" from the [[2013 CSCL paper]], where you are asking children who don't have content expertise to help co-design a technology or experience whose goal it is to teach the content expertise.

    - The context and abilities of co-designers/participants such as neurodiverse children results in more** indirect co-design/or design requirement articulation**. It requires some level of interpretation by designers.

    - > "We identified a key challenge in **faithfully representing input from participants while appreciating the value in our own experiences**. While in other contexts, the contribution of participants is more tangible, as they are directly co-designing the output, **the given context did not allow for this immediacy, and it fell to the designers to ensure that the input from our participants was upheld and shaped the outcome**.

    - > "Typically developing" children foregrounded different aspects of objects than neuro-diverse (ASC) children - Sensory Objects activity (p. 2379)

    - **Competing Requirements:** expandability and flexibility for play and social dev, but simple enough for use by a wide range of children

    - > "The project aims to evaluate the intervention created with respect to its impact on the social skills development of children. To facilitate such an evaluation, the design—as a research tool—had to be flexible and expandable to provide enough material for children to play with over several weeks. Furthermore, with the number of children being involved in such an evaluation, the design had to satisfy a wide range of preferences. On the other hand interaction had to be focused and simple enough to be able to collect data on a level that would allow meaningful analysis. It immediately becomes clear that all these forces do not necessarily pull the design in a single direction and it became a “wicked” problem. Neither the goals nor the expectations inherently linked to the different perspectives on developing ECHOES naturally converge." (p. )

    - What they did // **Method**

    - **What:** "Creative Workshop"

    - **Who:** Interdisciplinary team of researchers

    - **Goal:** To interpret the input of a year’s worth of PD work and converge the many disparate and complex requirements of ECHOES into a workable concept

    - **ECHOES:** To create a technologically enhanced learning environment to scaffold the social skill development of typically developing children and children with high functioning Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) or Aspergers Syndrome (AS).

    - Two Schools: one with 3 children with ASD; another with 30 typically developing children
