        - Abstract

            - We describe the development, application and evaluation of a design method tailored for working with people with mild to moderate dementia. Our experiences with the approach highlighted areas where designers and participants held radically different views. The tenet of our approach was that to overcome these differences we needed to create an empathic relationship between participants and designers. To achieve this we modified participatory design techniques to foster respectful engagement with participants in the development of a digital aid to facilitate "safe walking". The process begins with broad qualitative scoping and design work then moves to developing personally tailored, individual designs to further exploration of the experiential elements of the domain while reducing the need for the participants to engage in abstract thought. Reflection highlights a number of important areas that demand consideration when undertaking research in this area and, more generally, when performing design work with people with dementia.

    - [[AJ Rudd Jr]] read this paper and extracted notes from it. Discussed with [[Joel Chan]] and [[Wei-Wei Chi]].

    - There were three main evidence notes that emerged from this:

        - [[[[EVD]] - physical prototypes were necessary to prompt aid discussion with codesigners with dementia, but also led to fixation on unfinished aspects of the design - [[@lindsayEmpathyParticipatoryDesign2012b]]]]

        - [[[[EVD]] - Using language to evoke separation between participants with dementia and the design team was sometimes necessary to allow for honest feedback - @lindsayEmpathyParticipatoryDesign2012b]]

        - [[[[EVD]] - Designers inadvertently made assumptions while analyzing transcripts from design sessions which discounted important desires from participants with dementia - [[@lindsayEmpathyParticipatoryDesign2012b]]]]

    - This would be an interesting piece to compare with [[@pradhanUnderstandingOlderAdults2020]] because of the shared population of older adults (though in pradhan's case, not with dementia), and the theme of self-censoring.
