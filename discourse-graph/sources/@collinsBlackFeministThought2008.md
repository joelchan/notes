        - Abstract

            - In spite of the double burden of racial and gender discrimination, African-American women have developed a rich intellectual tradition that is not widely known. In Black Feminist Thought, originally published in 1990, Patricia Hill Collins set out to explore the words and ideas of Black feminist intellectuals and writers, both within the academy and without. Here Collins provides an interpretive framework for the work of such prominent Black feminist thinkers as Angela Davis, bell hooks, Alice Walker, and Audre Lorde. Drawing from fiction, poetry, music and oral history, the result is a superbly crafted and revolutionary book that provided the first synthetic overview of Black feminist thought and its canon.

- [[@collinsBlackFeministThought2008]] idea of [[matrix of domination]] as a framework - what are different ways that power dynamics shape society?

    - Four aspects/levels

        - **Structural** - organizes oppression (law and policies)

        - **Disciplinary** - administers and manages oppression (implements laws and policies)

        - **Hegenomic** - circulates oppressive ideas (culture and media)

        - **Interpersonal** - individual experience of oppression (individual experiences of oppression)
