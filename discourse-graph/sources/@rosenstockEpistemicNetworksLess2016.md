        - Abstract

            - We show that previous results from epistemic network models by Kevin J. S. Zollman and Erich Kummerfeld showing the benefits of decreased connectivity in epistemic networks are not robust across changes in parameter values. Our findings motivate discussion about whether and how such models can inform real world epistemic communities.

    - interesting exploration and insights on the propagation of belief in epistemic communities

        - What if the node represents an idea rather than an individual?

            - Is it possible to strengthen certain ideas while weakening others through spaced repetition?

                - A potential motivation for exploring  unlearning obsolete knowledge

            - Does spaced repetition of a particular idea reinforce its belief?

                - Another way of phrasing it: Does the degree of interconnectedness of an idea indicative of the strength of its belief?
