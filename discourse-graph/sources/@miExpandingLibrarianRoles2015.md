    - #lit-context

        - [[SOTA]] for [[P: Libraries supercharging communities of practice]]

        - Still an underexplored thread, looks like, based at least on citations (9 citations as of [[May 25th, 2020]], and except for [[@radfordSharedValuesNew2017]], no citations that focus on this specific sort of bridge between [[libraries]] and [[communities of practice]]):

        - #C-Setting #[[m/s/In vivo]] in academic context (so [[Academic [[libraries]]]])

    - #[[üìù lit-notes]]

        - #TLDR - case study of a librarian developing a [[faculty learning community]]. includes rich descriptions what was *done*, but lacking in understanding of what *works* and *why.

        - Questions I have after skimming the abstract

            - I wonder what kinds of information the faculty were seeking?

            - I wonder what challenges the librarians faced when trying to set up the community?

            - I wonder what the implementation looked like?

        - Framing as learning (p. 25) - I wonder what this means for #D/KNEXT ?

        - Interesting difference in the #C-Setting from #D/KNEXT - here, the librarians seem more physically embedded with the community bc they are on the same campus.

        - Many of the goals of the [[faculty learning community]] seem very similar to ours at #D/KNEXT (p. 29)

        - Some details of the setup

            - When

                - Year long

                - At least bi-weekly events

            - Who

                - Librarian

                    - Seek input before and throughout on what to discuss (p. 30)

                        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FYD6OD9-bQN.png?alt=media&token=e944b376-7751-4345-b5ef-60b50d8e2179)

                    - Provide resources to help FLC members lead discussions at events (p. 31)

                        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FNwuPa3espd.png?alt=media&token=ba730e45-c0db-490e-b3aa-4aec87b26748)

                - FLC members

                    - Participate

                    - Present

            - What

                - Mix of events: seminars, workshops, open discussion, research forums, and opening and closing retreats (all [[f2f]] as far as I can tell) (p. 30)

                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FAdwOv4r7pM.png?alt=media&token=7537dbf5-df49-4bbf-8805-66579cefac87)

                - Supplemented with online stuff (p. 31), like Google Calendar, and a [[sys/Wiki]] too!

                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FRRyfbEbHWT.png?alt=media&token=48ad6c50-1dda-488b-843f-e4a452d23bfa)

        - Challenges/opportunities

            - Lots of time needed to set up (p. 31). Maybe this is partly what the grant paid for?

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FThoFVs3sq6.png?alt=media&token=4ed44ac5-638b-4a0f-9375-85bafac34a3a)

            - #appraisal hard to tell if it worked well. there are two positive comments, but they're quite general and don't really tell us anything about the core outcomes of interest that the authors themselves note are important (interactions, relationships, knowledge exchange) (p. 32)

                - How do you know if it's working??
