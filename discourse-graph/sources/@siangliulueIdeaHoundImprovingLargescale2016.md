        - Introduces idea of [[[[PTN]] - Integrated crowdsourcing]]: instead of having people do a laborious secondary task that is valuable for others (e.g., semantic judgments), seamlessly integrate that task into a primary task that people are already intrinsically motivated to do

            - In collaborative brainstorming with virtual whiteboards, clustering of ideas (post-its) is a natural behavior that is intrinsically useful for the task. [[sys/Ideahound]] integrated semantic judgment work into this by providing "boxes" for users to use as containers for clusters, and building a semantic model of the space based on how post-its clustered together. This semantic model allowed for more intelligent recommendation of diverse examples, as well as visual overviews of the evolving design space.

            - Could be a powerful pattern to apply for [[[[QUE]] - How can we best bridge private vs. public knowledge?]]: use private stuff as grist for **computing** something that is shared in a useful way, instead of sharing private stuff directly.

                - Long-range analogy to [[Preparation for Future Learning]]?
