        - Abstract

            - The dominant literature on research synthesis methods has positivist and neo-positivist origins. In recent years, the landscape of research synthesis methods has changed rapidly to become inclusive. This article highlights methodologically inclusive advancements in research synthesis methods. Attention is drawn to insights from interpretive, critical, and participatory traditions for enhancing trustworthiness, utility, and/or emancipatory potential for research syntheses. Also noted is a paucity of the literature that builds connections between methodologically diverse segments of the literature on research synthesis methods. Salient features of a methodologically inclusive research synthesis (MIRS) framework are described. The MIRS framework has been conceptualized by distilling and synthesizing ideas, theories, and strategies from the extensive literatures on research synthesis methods and primary research methods. Rather than prescribe how a research synthesis should be conducted or evaluated, this article attempts to open spaces, raise questions, explore possibilities, and contest taken-for-granted practices.

- Let me do a quick read of [[@suriAdvancementsResearchSynthesis2009]] to get the juices flowing.

    - Some thoughts while reading:

        - This quote:

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FqdEpiMgXJS.png?alt=media&token=9feb00ea-cf3d-45e4-ad76-b93829c09158) (p. 401)

        - Sparked a thought about framing the second piece of the puzzle as essentially a rapid generative distributed synthesis

            - This is really only possible with the right tools!

            - And gets out of the framework of other tools that are meant to speed up a specific kind of [[systematic review]] leading to a quantitative synthesis, such as a [[m/meta-analysis]]

        - At this high level then, we essentially have a workshop that involves (cycles of) two elements:

            1. A ^^**framing**^^ component to rapidly build shared ownership and trust and a generative (vs. evaluative, adversarial) task framing

                1. Built in part on elements from [[Design Thinking]], with a helpful output as one or more generative frames (questions), as well as ideas (that can be seeds of claims to explore)

            1. A ^^**rapid collaborative synthesis**^^ component

        - There is a shared sense of this being a faster than usual process. But speed itself isn't the main thing: it's the getting over the big common barriers of integrating diverse perspectives.

            - Basically, best case scenario is a single head integrating diverse perspectives over a long period of time. This is best for the bus factor: [[[[CLM]] - The most transformative insights must come from a single "mind"]]

            - But we don't have this very often and can't control it.

            - So we can assemble multidisciplinary teams.

                - But there's a TON of overhead for this, which basically can boil down to:

                    - Socially being able to work together (gel-ing, norming, forming), and

                    - Knowing the same things, so that our respective ideas can start to intermingle and intercombine towards synergy

                - Both of these are at play in regular teams, but are especially magnified in cross-boundary teams. I think? see [[@paletzSocialCognitiveFrameworkMultidisciplinary2010]]

                    - There's status stuff at play, trust, adversarial, territorial dynamics

                    - As well as translational problems and hierarchies of evidence and tacit knowledge

                        - For that we need a representation that can bring these to the surface in a concrete way to be explicitly negotiated and used

                            - In short, a [[[[PTN]] - boundary object]]!

                                - It's been shown to facilitate coordination across boundaries (see review from [[@huvilaBoundaryObjectsInformation2017]], although see cautions from [[@leighstarThisNotBoundary2010]]). more stuff from [[Gerhard Fischer]] too [[@ariasEnvisionmentDiscoveryCollaboratory2015]].

                                - And has been extended to the idea of design artifacts as boundary objects to facilitate [[multivoicedness]]: Design success may not involve convergence to "unite the many voices of design into one"; rather, the goal might be to find a way to let many voices live in tension and conversation, without premature resolution.  [[@bodkerDesignCollaboratoriumPlace2002]]

                                    - This relates very well to [[@strikeTypesSynthesisTheir1983]]'s criterion of synthesis as clarifying, but not necessarily resolving, underlying differences in material synthesized!

- reminds me of the stuff bouncing around in my head with [[org/invisible college]], "real" [[citizen science]], epistemic diversity w/ [[Chinmay Kulkarni]]: Enable **epistemological diversity**: Another core problem to be solved when synthesizing ideas across disciplines is epistemological diversity. If people are too narrow in their thinking about what is "admissible knowledge" and/or "admissible ways of knowing", we risk missing crucial pieces of the puzzle, or operating from incorrect assumptions (also [[@suriAdvancementsResearchSynthesis2009]])
