        - Abstract

            - This paper describes the design work being conducted as part of the OutsideTheBox project. Within the time-frame of eight months, we engaged four children with autism in a participatory design process to develop their own smart object. We re-interpreted Future Workshops and Co-operative Inquiry to demonstrate that a) autistic children can lead processes with a deliberately open design brief and b) this leads us to explore design spaces that are un-imaginable for neuro-typical, adult designers. To capture these four design cases, we have developed Design Exposes, a concept that is inspired by annotated portfolios and Actor-Network Theory. We apply this concept to our cases and present four exposes that subsequently allow us to draw out intermediate-level design knowledge about co-creating technology with autistic children. We close by critically reflecting on the design processes as well as our concept of capturing them.

        - [[EVD]]s

            - teachers and helpers needed to be present in the beginning to help them get comfortable

                - also echoed in [[@bentonDevelopingIDEASSupporting2012b]], but there they were there all the team (could be bc it was group)

            - need structure

                - theme of structure connects with [[@bentonDevelopingIDEASSupporting2012b]], who go a bit further

            - negotating the space was necessary (moving to the ground led to better results)

                - reminds [[Salma Elsayed-Ali]] of [[@walshFACITPDFramework2013]]

                    - 8. **Physical Interaction** #barrier (design is messy process that necessitates movement of people and things?)
