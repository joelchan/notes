        - Abstract

            - We are reaching the end of the second generation of knowledge management, with its focus on tacit‚Äêexplicit knowledge conversion. Triggered by the [[SECI model]] of Nonaka, it replaced a first generation focus on timely information provision for decision support and in support of BPR initiatives. Like BPR it has substantially failed to deliver on its promised benefits. The third generation requires the clear separation of context, narrative and content management and challenges the orthodoxy of scientific management. Complex adaptive systems theory is used to create a sense‚Äêmaking model that utilises self‚Äêorganising capabilities of the informal communities and identifies a natural flow model of knowledge creation, disruption and utilisation. However, the argument from nature of many complexity thinkers is rejected given the human capability to create order and predictability through collective and individual acts of freewill. Knowledge is seen paradoxically, as both a thing and a flow requiring diverse management approaches.

        - Talks a lot about how [[[[CLM]] - Knowledge is fundamentally contextual]], and defines boundaries of [[context]] within which knowledge transfer is easier/feasible

- [[Cynefin model]] (see [[@snowdenComplexActsKnowing2002]]) is entry point into [[Knowledge Management]] lit that echoes a lot of what was described in [[@ackermanSharingKnowledgeExpertise2013]], but from a (very? no citations of [[David Snowden]] at all in ackerman) different lineage, a lot running through knowledge management proper, and involving other canonical ideas like the [[SECI model]] and this influential [[Cynefin model]] from [[David Snowden]], less so [[[[PTN]] - boundary object]]s and the like from CSCW.

    - This stuff is actually hugely foundational, for both [[D/KNEXT]] and [[D/Synthesis Infrastructure]]. In some ways, a core defining concern of mine is [[Knowledge Management]] for creative work. And [[D/Synthesis Infrastructure]] is really about [[Knowledge Management]] but for scientific discovery and [[synthesis]]?
