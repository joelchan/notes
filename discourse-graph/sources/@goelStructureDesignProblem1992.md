        - Abstract

            - It is proposed that there are important generalizations about problem solving in design activity that reach across specific disciplines. A framework for the study of design is presented that (a) characterizes design as a radial category and fleshes out the task environment of the prototypical cases; (b) takes the task environment seriously; (c) shows that this task environment occurs in design tasks, but does not occur in every nondesign task; (d) explicates the impact of this task environment on the design problem space; and (e) demonstrates that, given the structure of the information-processing system, the features noted in the problem spaces of design tasks will not all occur in problem spaces where the task environment is vastly different. This analysis leads to the claim that there are a set of invariant features in the problem spaces of design situations that collectively constitute a design problem space. Protocol studies are reported in which the problem spaces of three design tasks in architecture, mechanical engineering, and instructional design are explored and compared with several protocols from nondesign problem-solving tasks.

    - #lit-context

        - studies are greatly expanded on book-length treatment (summarizing the dissertation work) in [[@goelSketchesThought1995]]

    - #[[üìù lit-notes]]

        - the designers they studied returned to problem formulation activities throughout the design process, not just in the beginning of the process

        - similar to [[@simonStructureIllStructured1973]] and [[@rittelDilemmasGeneralTheory1973]], lays out characteristics of [[Ill-structured problem]]s, specifically a set of dimensions on which to contrast them with [[well-structured problem]]s

            - distribution of information

            - nature of constraints

            - size and complexity of problems

            - component parts

            - interconnectivity of parts

            - right and wrong answers

            - input/output

            - feedback loop

            - cost of errors

            - independent functioning of artifact

            - distinction between specification and delivery

            - temporal separation between specification and delivery
