- Sketch of an idea to develop for new forms of moldable conversation (cc [[@kriegerChattingGlueCognitive2020]]) in [[sys/RoamResearch]] [[@[[roaminati]]]]:

    - With some basic JS/CSS, it is quite feasible to replicate basic chat affordances in Roam, to simulate the "stream", back and forth feel of a regular chatroom

        - This is basically what I'd sketched out earlier: Probably easier to make a "chat-like" or "forum-like" space in Roam (forced sequential / shared time stream, which we simulate with a note-taker)

        - We already have the beginnings of a prototype for this in the [[roaminati]] graph, courtesy of [[Beau Haan]]

        - Another set of possible primitives come from [[David Vargas]]'s new timeline JS extension

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FeD6vsmXNbj.png?alt=media&token=4543c7ba-6b61-462d-a784-c745184455c8)

    - To recap, the core question from [[@kriegerChattingGlueCognitive2020]]:

        - > How can we go beyond a linear, temporal low-bandwidth activity without getting in the way of the sublime symbiosis of speaking?

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F2em53H71ug.png?alt=media&token=4dd67b6a-16da-473b-920a-e7ac28a15785)

        - I agree with the basic point, cc [[[[PTN]] - Prefer to accrete new infrastructures on top of existing ones]], that:

            - > ...I'm not thinking of a radically new design for chat. I prefer an incremental, familiar form, but with the **affordances** we need to break free of the linearized world

                - And I'd add to that, not just linearized, but de[[context]]ualized, flattened, atomic world. Like [[@jollyFlatlandFallacyMoving2019]]

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2Fv29xwYZ83s.png?alt=media&token=df675819-c57f-4c49-a7f7-92516024ad90)

    - In summary, I think it is very possible (and desirable!) to explore these ideas around grounding in familiar linear, synchronous streams, but providing means to escape that into nonlinear explorations, as [[@kriegerChattingGlueCognitive2020]] [posits](> How can we go beyond a linear, temporal low-bandwidth activity without getting in the way of the sublime symbiosis of speaking?) is desirable.

        - This is important, because I think ^^many things cannot **start** in an asynchronous, structured medium: they may need to end up there, or be possible to view in that space, but they cannot be born there^^.

            - This feels similar to [[[[PTN]] - incremental formalization]]

                - Seen in this way, the problem of "bubbling up" structure from the beautiful chaos of synchronous conversation is analogous to (or maybe a special case of?) the more general problem of how to join the chaos stream / magical junkyard of fleeting notes with the [[disciplined imagination]] of other spaces?

    - But because this is in Roam, we can do more: we don't have to stay in the linear dimension

        - People can bring a whole lot more of themselves into the conversation, and provide powerful [[context]] and entry points into their wisdom, cc [[conversations as context]]

            - Doubly so once roam/inter becomes a widely available thing. I can write in a shared chatroom while having full access to my own graph to reference things in and weave it together with others'.

        - On top of that, nonlinear threading can happen within the chat stream, not unlike what happens on Twitter. It's just not visible or interactable.

            - But [[sys/Treeverse]] shows us an alternative interaction layer on top of this!

                - It has the feeling of "unspooling" - taking a different vantage point to "see" the underlying hidden structure

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FcVyxida0sb.png?alt=media&token=69996178-bf46-4f6d-8644-367178df8d69)

        - And of course, efforts like [[sys/Wikum]] [[@zhangWikumBridgingDiscussion2017]] show us other ways to "pull out" or "view" or "unspool" a conversation

            - The unspooling in Wikum still happens within the threaded conversation medium, but it doesn't have to stay there!
