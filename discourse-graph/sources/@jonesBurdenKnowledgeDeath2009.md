- To advance science, scientists must __synthesize__ what is currently known and unknown about scientific problems. However, synthesis is a difficult task that is growing harder, leading to slowdowns in research progress [[@jonesBurdenKnowledgeDeath2009]]. Published synthesis outputs, such as systematic reviews, often fail to keep pace with the growth of knowledge  [[@shojaniaHowQuicklySystematic2007]], and automated synthesis is still a distant frontier [[@kilicogluBiomedicalTextMining2017]]. The current trajectory is unsustainable and the need for synthesis is likely to increase, as significant problems (e.g. climate change, information warfare, pandemic response) increasingly cross disciplinary boundaries.

    - This proposal investigates a key underexplored __process-level__ barrier to synthesis: the **mismatch between the information models that would best enable knowledge synthesis, and the models that actually underlie most scientists' reading and synthesis practices and systems**.
