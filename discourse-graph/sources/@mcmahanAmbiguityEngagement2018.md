            - culture (as applied to science and scholarship)

                - maybe similar to [[@cetinaEpistemicCulturesHow1999]]?

        - Approach

            - Coming from sociological background and stance (in American Journal of Sociology), but is computational social science

            - Draws on [[information theory]], including [[@shannonMathematicalTheoryCommunication1948]] and [[Shannon Entropy]].

                - Shannon and Weaver 1963 is key ref

        - Claimed contributions

            - model of ambiguous expression in scholarly literature

            - results that show how ambiguity acts like a [[[[PTN]] - boundary object]] that stimulates social learning (not sure how this is going to be shown)

    - # Implications / Discussion

        - Authors want to claim that reductions in ambiguity could be bad for science bc they reduce fragmentation. And therefore we should be careful about trying to remove ambiguity.

            - But I'm not entirely convinced, for two reasons.

                - Effect size here is very small.

                - Not clear to me that fragmentation per se is bad - feel like we need to have a sense of useful "set points" or equilibria for this parameter.

                    - See, e.g., suggestions of [[Zollman Effect]]

            - In favor of this:

                - ideas around [[ðŸ§± sensemaking]] and [[[[PTN]] - incremental formalization]] (see, e.g., [[@shipmanFormalityConsideredHarmful1999]])

                - phenomenon of [[Scatter]] is thought to be [major reason interdisciplinarity is hard]([[[[CLM]] - Interdisciplinary synthesis is hard because of scatter in the literature]])

                - Representing ideas more abstractly in terms of [[Schemas]] in can facilitate [analogical]([[analogy]]) transfer

        - Other connections/seeds for thought

            - Against "objectivity theater" (h/t [[Alan (Red) Ransil]])

            - What are the implications here for [[interoperability]], maybe vs. standardization?

                - Cc [[[[CLM]] - Knowledge is fundamentally contextual]] and potentially [[[[CLM]] - Universal Semantic Webs are neither feasible nor useful]]

                    - Past thinking on this:

                        - A fundamental uncertainty is whether the relatively formalized nature of [[[[PTN]] - discourse graph]] can be integrated with the open-ended, seemingly unstructured, backtrack-ridden, speculative and "half-baked" nature of thinking that underlies real synthesis (see [[@gruberDarwinManPsychological1974]] for vivid descriptions of this). Some past work on whether/how formality can be integrated into systems for supporting thinking suggests there is a real danger that imposing such formalisms may yield more harm (e.g., by cutting off speculative lines of inquiry, imposing too much overhead) than benefits in settings characterized by context-dependent, evolving requirements for formal structure, such as creative knowledge work in uncharted domains (see [[@shipmanFormalityConsideredHarmful1999]] for an excellent introduction to this). A related danger is that the kinds of knowledge that is necessary for

    - # Methods

        - [[ambiguity]] operationalized as word synonym entropy

            - define as posterior distribution over pr(M | t, c) (probability of each possible meaning for a given token in a given context) - see Appendix A (how to build "meaning graph" for each token), and Appendix B (how to estimate ambiguity)

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FyJ2BvBP1aJ.png?alt=media&token=06e19e17-993e-43dc-9095-47215d99ff63)

                - very similar to [[LDA]]

                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FkBZZ_HTTGv.png?alt=media&token=1b9f4a7c-5f25-4555-82c0-4f2785d46fb6) (p. 898)

            - meaning simplified to proxy into synonyms from Moby and WordNet thesauri

                - would prefer to define as cliques in synonym graph, but... for reasons, decided to simplify to just directed edges + the neighborhood

            - validated against human judgments (see Appendix C)

            - examples (from data)

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FgI8AhKGeTl.png?alt=media&token=ae39c2be-5b06-48f4-bb34-4216808fc838) (p. 885)

        - "engagement" operationalized as graph entropy over subgraph from each article for max (1k cites, 3 recursive runs), computed in terms of maximal [[network modularity]] (intuitively, a kind of "cliqueiness" or fragmentation, so higher here = lower engagement, i think)

            - examples (from data):

            - network modularity correlated at -.76 with topological entropy for random sample of 1.2k abstracts

        - sample: ~1.1M abstracts from Web of Science (after trimming for min. threshold citations, and at least 5 usable terms for ambiguity measure in abstract)

    - # Misc notes

        - There's something really important here, I think, about the connection between ambiguity and generativity... more than you can credibly claim

            - relevant for [[[[QUE]] - What are the most efficient routes to useful cross-boundary knowledge?]]: answer here is - sometimes through inspirational public syntheses that are both unoriginal and untrue????

            - and also there is something here about [[[[CLM]] - Paths to creative breakthroughs are frequently oblique]]: look at this! objectively speaking, schrodinger's book/lecture was both unoriginal and untrue!!! but yet it had a really big impact!!! why???

        - Came across this note in Evernote from [[February 26th, 2019]] in google search:

            - Not published yet. Key finding: jargon can balkanize field, hindering integration, but not always. Scientists' awareness of other work is independent of their ability to understand it.

        - Example of ambiguity and engagement: [[social capital]] facilitates conversations between sociology and economics

        - Scope of claim: social/human "sciences" only, or also natural sciences? Authors want to go further than just human sciences.

- [[@mcmahanAmbiguityEngagement2018]]

    - Ambiguity in language can be helpful for integrating work: even [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Thomas Kuhn]] were examples of work where language was ambiguous, and this ended up having positive effects on the science
[[February 3rd, 2021]]

- Here is the paper [[@mcmahanAmbiguityEngagement2018]]

    - They make an explicit connection to [[[[PTN]] - boundary object]]s!

    - I think the lesson here is: if you try to pretend the ambiguity doesn't exist, or force it to go away (necessary maybe for machine Reasoning over Knowledge Graph), then you run into problems
