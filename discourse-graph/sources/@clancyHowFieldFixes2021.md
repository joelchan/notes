        - Abstract

            - Listen now (30 min) | Getting an academic field to change its ways is hard. Independent scientists canâ€™t just go rogue - they need research funding, they need to publish, and they need (or want) tenure. All those things require convincing a community of your peers to accept the merit of your research agenda. And yet, humans are humans. They can be biased. And if they are biased towards the status quo, it can be hard for change to take root.

    - one impactful cite is this one: [[@akerlofPersistenceFalseParadigms2018]], which matt unpacks in the blog post nicely: provides a way of thinking about how small amounts of bias in favor of the ingroup can lead to large dynamical effects over time on diversity/health of methods, but also how there seem to be "cut points" in the parameter space of bias levels that can meaningfully curtail these negative effects
