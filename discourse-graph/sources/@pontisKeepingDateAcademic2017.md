    - Year: [[2017]]

    - Publication: Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology ([[JASIST]])
- Reading notes

    - really interesting examination of the degree to which scicomm happens through formal vs. informal channels (cf. I think the idea here is that a surprising amount of communication occurs between scientists through "informal" channels? #[[Z]]) (from [[@menzelPlannedUnplannedScientific1959]])

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FY_4EsrnlEP?alt=media&token=5a6eb3ba-020f-465b-b31d-d4f442a07470)

    - focused on information seeking mostly ([[üß± foraging]]), but talks about the need for mechanisms to help "filter information" at the point of need.

        - Not quite [[synthesis]], but seems like a place where [[synthesis]] shoud be happening and helping (p. 30-31)
