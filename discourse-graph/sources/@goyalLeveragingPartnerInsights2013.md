        - Abstract

            - SAVANT is a web-based tool that enables information and knowledge sharing between remote partners through explicit and implicit communication to help them collaboratively analyze and make sense of distributed data. SAVANT's implicit sharing provides an opportunity to leverage partners' insights and reduce cognitive tunneling, and explicit sharing facilitates discussion. Both techniques assist collaborative sensemaking processes.
