        - Abstract

            - Since a series of academic case studies had revealed Toyotaâ€™s unique product development practices to the world, a flurry of research has been conducted into [[set-based design]], also known as set-based concurrent engineering. In this paper, we review work related to set-based design across academic communities in efforts to find common themes and influences. After a review of this literature, we inductively arrive at two Principles of Set-Based Thinking: considering sets of distinct alternatives concurrently and delaying convergent decision making. These Principles allow us to articulate a working description of set-based design. We then examine these two Principles at work in a case example of a common theoretical construct in design.
