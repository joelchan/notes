- Title:: Embodied cognition and the magical future of interaction design
- Author(s):: [[David Kirsh]]
- Abstract:: The theory of [[embodied cognition]] can provide HCI practitioners and theorists with new ideas about interaction and new principles for better designs. I support this claim with four ideas about cognition: (1) interacting with tools changes the way we think and perceive -- tools, when manipulated, are soon absorbed into the body schema, and this absorption leads to fundamental changes in the way we perceive and conceive of our environments; (2) we think with our bodies not just with our brains; (3) we know more by doing than by seeing -- there are times when physically performing an activity is better than watching someone else perform the activity, even though our motor resonance system fires strongly during other person observation; (4) there are times when we literally think with things. These four ideas have major implications for interaction design, especially the design of tangible, physical, context aware, and telepresence systems.

- something from the embodied/distributed/situated cognition folks. from [[David Kirsh]] - [[@kirshEmbodiedCognitionMagical2013]] is not a bad in, and maybe also [[@klemmerHowBodiesMatter2006]]

    - These empirical and design insights have grounding in the idea that cognition is embodied, situated, and distributed [[@clarkSupersizingMindEmbodiment2010]], [[@klemmerHowBodiesMatter2006]], [[@hollanDistributedCognitionNew2000]], [[@greenoSituativityKnowingLearning1998]]: cognitive processes are not just "influenced by" tools and environments and embodied states; they are also "implemented" in a distributed "hardware", of which the brain is but one component alongside other materials such as other people, tools, and the structure of one's environment.
