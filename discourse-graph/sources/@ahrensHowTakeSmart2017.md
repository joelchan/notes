- [[Raul Pacheco-Vega]] reviews [[@ahrensHowTakeSmart2017]]! Doesn't use [[sys/Zettelkasten]] proper, but there are definitely some important points of overlap

- Roots in the practices of [[Niklas Luhmann]] (good intro in [[@schmidtNiklasLuhmannCard2018]]; popularized to the English-speaking world through [[@ahrensHowTakeSmart2017]])

    - Has [[Atomicity]]/[[compression]] (granularity)

    - And [[context]] (literature notes), although not quite as strong on this front, perhaps owing a little to the context of its development: social theory

    - And a strong emphasis on the graph component
[[PTN - Organize by using]]

- Also related to idea from [[sys/Zettelkasten]] (cc. [[@ahrensHowTakeSmart2017]]) on the need to tag by context of use, not as  "taxonomy" (cc )

    - Principle #8: Organize your notes by context, not by topic
