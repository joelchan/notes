        - Abstract

            - We develop a model describing how false paradigms may persist, hindering scientific progress. The model features two paradigms, one describing reality better than the other. Tenured scientists display homophily: They favor tenure candidates who adhere to their paradigm. As in statistics, power is the probability (absent any bias) of denying tenure to scientists adhering to the false paradigm. The model shows that because of homophily, when power is low, the false paradigm may prevail. Then, only an increase in power can ignite convergence to the true paradigm. Historical case studies suggest that low power comes either from lack of empirical evidence or from reluctance to base tenure decisions on available evidence.

- one impactful cite is this one: [[@akerlofPersistenceFalseParadigms2018]], which matt unpacks in the blog post nicely: provides a way of thinking about how small amounts of bias in favor of the ingroup can lead to large dynamical effects over time on diversity/health of methods, but also how there seem to be "cut points" in the parameter space of bias levels that can meaningfully curtail these negative effects
