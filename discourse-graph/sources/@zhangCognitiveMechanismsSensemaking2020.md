    - Authored by::  [[Pengyi Zhang]] ,  Dagobert Soergel

    - Year: 2020

    - Publication: Journal of the Association for Information Science and  Technology ([[JASIST]])
- Context

    - Task is [[ðŸ§± sensemaking]] that seems lower in terms of [[synthesis]] than a lit review for [[problem (re)formulation]]

- Reading notes

    - Analyzes very detailed "cognitive mechanisms" (processes) that are sequenced together to make up [[ðŸ§± sensemaking]]

        - "data-driven" inductive mechanisms like key item extraction, [[Schema]] induction, and generalization

        - structure-driven and logic-driven (top-down?) like defintion, specification, elemination, and explanation and inference

        - combo of top-down and bottom-up, ,.like comparison, classification, analogy/metaphor

- [[@zhangCognitiveMechanismsSensemaking2020]] Title: Cognitive mechanisms in sensemaking: A qualitative user study

    - New stuff following up on [[@zhangpengyiComprehensiveModelCognitive2014]] thread with a really nice focus on cognitive mechanisms, probably SOTA rn on models of [[ðŸ§± sensemaking]] - still at different level of analysis (much more granular and much less object-focused, and for quite different tasks than scholarly [[synthesis]])
[[Z Sensemaking models partially model scholarly synthesis as of April 21st, 2020]]

- Outside of lit reviewing and scholarly synthesis specifically we have a large number of models, with one recent synthesis of models by [[@zhangpengyiComprehensiveModelCognitive2014]] - best in this thread rn is [[@zhangCognitiveMechanismsSensemaking2020]]
