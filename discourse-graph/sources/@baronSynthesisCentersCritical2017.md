- maybe a touch more insight into that in this paper [[@baronSynthesisCentersCritical2017]] (and the literature it cites)

    - See especially the point about "active management"

    - Ok, so:

        - [[@palmerPracticesFacilitatingInterdisciplinary2016]] (not to be confused with [[Carole L. Palmer]]) talks about the importance of matchmaking for facilitating productive collaborations in a [[synthesis centers]], but there isn't a more precise quantitative argument, nor much detail on what works and what doesn't work

        - [[@lyallExperimentsInterdisciplinaryCapacitybuilding2013]] is an intro paper to a special issue on how to facilitate large-scale, long-term interdisciplinary collaborations

            - the papers have a case study flavor, so they might be worth looking into
