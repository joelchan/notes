        - Abstract

            - Drawing on the philosophy of psychological explanation, we suggest that psychological science, by focusing on effects, may lose sight of its primary explananda: psychological capacities. We revisit Marr’s levels-of-analysis framework, which has been remarkably productive and useful for cognitive psychological explanation. We discuss ways in which Marr’s framework may be extended to other areas of psychology, such as social, developmental, and evolutionary psychology, bringing new benefits to these fields. We then show how theoretical analyses can endow a theory with minimal plausibility even before contact with empirical data: We call this the theoretical cycle. Finally, we explain how our proposal may contribute to addressing critical issues in psychological science, including how to leverage effects to understand capacities better.

            - Which is a reason that [[[[CLM]] - Effective synthesis is hard]]: need more than just data

            - But also need lots of data! This is the idea of "background knowledge" (e.g., psychological plausibility constraints)

        - beautiful expression of this [[dialectic]] with the term "disciplined dreaming" (cf. [[disciplined imagination]])

                    - maybe fits with stuff that [[Matthew Akamatsu]] has been saying about the undervaluing of [[synthesis]] in his field

                - talks about the need for the [[dialectic]] [[dance between the theoretical and the evidential]] that is foundational to the scientific method

- this pairs nicely with [[@vanrooijTheoryTestHow2021]] in specifying heuristics and moves for theory-building, which... I think is a nice fit for [[[[PTN]] - discourse graph]] and [[context queries]]

    - how nice if we had tools and systems (with data!) that allowed us to explore these, in a somewhat analogous way to photoshop (exploring variants), simulations, statistical software, and other tools for thought.

    - what are the tools for synthesis?

        - as I've said in the past [[[[CLM]] - Effective individual synthesis systems (seem to mostly) exist (for a select few)]]

            - the critical problem, though is this: because they're so individual, everyone is effectively an island. what if you don't have?

            - a small exception, again, is sofware for [[systematic review]]s, but again, this doesn't solve our problem, bc so much [[synthesis]] that we want to do goes far beyond [[RCT]]s

                - plus, they're often, afaict, "use once", not really supporting [[interoperability]] [[@oconnorStillMovingAutomation2019]] and [[reuse]] [[@blakeCollaborativeInformationSynthesis2006a]]

- One thing I'm thinking about, still inspired by [[@vanrooijTheoryTestHow2021]] and [[@scheelWhyHypothesisTesters2020]] is to really dig into what the main concepts and [[explananda]] are here

    - In the past I've tended to use examples for exposition, with the "real meat" being the theory and experiments

    - But that's exactly backwards! The phenomena always need to be absolutely FRONT AND CENTER, driving the whole process from the get-go

    - In this case, I want to pay attention to subtle differences in mechanisms/patterns: direct borrowing of a solution (classical [[@gickAnalogicalProblemSolving1980]] style), flavor of [[bricolage]], probably easier lift, vs. more [indirect pathways of inspiration]([[[[CLM]] - A significant proportion of the benefits of analogical stimuli is oblique or indirect]])

- On the other hand, theory-free mining of data patterns cannot lead to the depth of understanding needed to explain and solve difficult real-world problems ([[@newellYouCanPlay1973]], [[@katzHowPlay202018]], [[@jonasCouldNeuroscientistUnderstand2017]], [[@vanrooijTheoryTestHow2021]], [[@marderTheoreticalMusings2020]]). This is because observations are inherently driven by our theories, which can often preclude observing the very data needed to construct powerful new theories [[@popperLogicScientificDiscovery1959]]; further, the space of possible theories is typically severely underdetermined by data.
