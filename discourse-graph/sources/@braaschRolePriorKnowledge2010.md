    - [[EVD - Participants with more domain knowledge about the source domain performed better on all asses...hen they were presented with analogies in their learning text. - @braaschRolePriorKnowledge2010]]

    - [[EVD - Participants who were presented with the analogy text exhibited better learning rates, exhibi...lanations than participants who were presented a summary text. - @braaschRolePriorKnowledge2010]]
