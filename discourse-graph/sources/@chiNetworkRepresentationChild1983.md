- Title:: Network representation of a child's dinosaur knowledge.
- Author(s):: [[M. T. H. Chi]], [[R. D. Koeske]]
- Abstract:: A young child's knowledge of 40 dinosaurs was elicited from two tasks. The data gathered from these knowledge-production protocols were used to map two in- terrelated semantic networks of dinosaurs, viewed as concept nodes connected by links. The two mappings corresponded to two sets of dinosaurs (20 each), partitioned on the basis of external criteria: mother's subjective judgment of the child's knowledge of each dinosaur and the frequency of mention in the child's dinosaur books. Comparisons of the structure of the two mappings were based on three attributes: (a) number of links, (b) strength of links, and (c) the internal cohesion of the network in terms of higher order groupings and specific patterns of interlinkages. The validity of the differential structures of the two mappings was verified by the corresponding differential memory performance. The better structured set of dinosaurs was more easily remembered and retained by the child over a year than the less structured set of dinosaurs.
