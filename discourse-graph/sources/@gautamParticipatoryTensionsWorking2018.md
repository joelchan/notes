        - Abstract

            - This note uncovers a design tension in participatory design practice in the context of two organizations in Nepal working on reducing sex-trafficking and helping survivors. The dilemma consists of contradictions between the public face that the organizations present to the world and the more complex underlying picture painted by survivors. In initial work, we created and deployed a value-elicitation game for survivors that gave us better access to their voices. However, the implications for ongoing participatory work remain to be unpacked. The veneer may constitute a necessary part of the staffs' successful interactions with external funders. The survivors rely on the resources that the organization gathers, yet the veneer may also obscure some aspects of the survivors' needs. The question raised is "how should our PD practice position itself with respect to the ideal of comprehensive democratic participation when potential harm may ensue to vulnerable people?"

    - they did some ethnographic work (over roughly four weeks of observations of site visits and site interviews), and also did some PD work on value elicitation

    - Participants: included members of a professional organization, and members of a survivor organization, as well as survivors of sex trafficking, who the team refers to as sister-survivors, in Nepal

    - in the value elicitation branch,

        - they initially thought of doing a story-writing  exercise, but decided against it when the [sister-survivors told them that they had very difficult negative experiences with writing their stories in the past]([[[[EVD]] - Sex trafficking survivors shared concerns about painful experiences from writing their stories in design exercises. A future-focused photo elicitation method seemed to be a viable alternative - @gautamParticipatoryTensionsWorking2018]])

        - for this reason, the design team decided to go ahead with a [photo elicitation activity that was focused on their current and future in a positive way]([[[[EVD]] - Design team modified photo elicitation method so sex trafficking survivor participants' faces were not shown, for safety concerns - [[@gautamParticipatoryTensionsWorking2018]]]])

            - the designers felt it was necessary to modify the photo elicitation method to prevent the sister-survivors from showing their face in photos, due to safety concerns

            - [[Elizabeth Bonsignore]]: this technique is generally effective and has been used in various other "participatory" situations, but not necessarily PD (e.g., [[m/Participatory Action Research]])

                - similar to take-home camera journaling activity in [[[[EVD]] - Older adults needed to use special take-home activities to escape self-stereotyping - @pradhanUnderstandingOlderAdults2020]]

                - see [[Frank Vetere]] with youth literacy

    - from the ethnographic work, the team noticed that the [survivor organization staff members would sometimes speak of and for the sister-survivors]([[[[EVD]] - Sex-trafficking survivor organization staff members would sometimes speak of and for the survivors when talking about their needs - [[@gautamParticipatoryTensionsWorking2018]]]]). Sometimes this manifested as "**gentle correction**" of their statements about their goals

        - [[Salma Elsayed-Ali]] thought about two papers where the danger of things getting lost in translatino with proxies in [[Participatory Design]] - maybe this was with neurodiverse children

            - The challenges of proxies shows up in "Three tensions in participatory design for inclusion"

        - [[Elizabeth Bonsignore]] thinks that might show up with users who are nonverbal - probably [[Christopher Frauenberger]] has done some stuff with this?

            - see also JP Hourcade

            - and storykit

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FlrNnjgs1UR.png?alt=media&token=7ded0fe3-b2e8-4dea-a3ec-bbd870957100) (p. 3)

    - the design team also perceived possible tensions around how to navigate **power dynamics** and multiple competing values/goals from the main user population vs. the organizations that served them and provided access to them

        - for example, they worried that

            - > prioritizing the iteratively emerging voices of sister-survivors may put them at risk, especially if their directions require side-stepping and possibly alienating the NGOs

                - this is simlar to [[[[EVD]] - Black and LatinX codesign participants were reluctant to fully disclose past experiences bc they perceived researchers as connected to outsider authorities who could harm them - [[@harringtonDeconstructingCommunityBasedCollaborative2019]]]]

                - see also Pam Wisniewski's work with youth engaging in risky behaviors

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2Fi8LUqOArpD.png?alt=media&token=12a38791-227d-4b73-bfdd-852b99bd81f2) (p. 4)

    - in summary, there seem to be three evidence pieces

- {{[[DONE]]}} [[Sarah Dipasquale]] trial run extracting evidence and claims from [[@gautamParticipatoryTensionsWorking2018]] for our focal question

    - remember: claims are generalizations (that can be supported/opposed), evidence are concrete observations (that can be reproduced)

    - do this in whatever software you're comfortable with, we will compare formats next week

    - example of the elements of an evidence note: [[[[EVD]] - physical prototypes were necessary to prompt aid discussion with codesigners with dementia, but also led to fixation on unfinished aspects of the design - [[@lindsayEmpathyParticipatoryDesign2012b]]]]

    - for evidence notes, we want basiaclly three things:

        - 1) a self-contained statement of the observation

            - use past tense, be as specific as possible

        - 3) collection of notes and excerpts that explain how to reproduce the observation

        - 2) excerpts or snippets that ground the observation (e.g., a graph, screenshot of participant quotes)
