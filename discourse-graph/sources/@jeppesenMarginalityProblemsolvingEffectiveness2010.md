        - Abstract

            - We examine who the winners are in science problem-solving contests characterized by open broadcast of problem infor-mation, self-selection of external solvers to discrete problems from the laboratories of large research and development intensive companies, and blind review of solution submissions. Analyzing a unique data set of 166 science challenges involving over 12,000 scientists revealed that technical and social marginality, being a source of different perspectives and heuristics, plays an important role in explaining individual success in problem solving. The provision of a winning solution was positively related to increasing distance between the solvers field of technical expertise and the focal field of the problem. Female solversknown to be in the outer circle of the scientific establishmentperformed significantly better than men in developing successful solutions. Our findings contribute to the emerging literature on open and dis-tributed innovation by demonstrating the value of openness, at least narrowly defined by disclosing problems, in removing barriers to entry to nonobvious individuals. We also contribute to the knowledge-based theory of the firm by showing the effectiveness of a market mechanism to draw out knowledge from diverse external sources to solve internal problems.

        - The [core result]([Solvers](((8JunxBU6A))) who chose to submit their solutions to the 2nd stage of an innovation contest and [self-rated themselves as more technically distant from the problem domain](((LtwnesPYh))) were slightly more likely to submit winning solutions for [Innocentive science problem solving contests](((OztGD5jl4)))) is often cited as an #example-of the phenomenon of [[outsider innovation]].

    - Other observations

        - Interesting to note here that the canonical [example]([[example-of]]) in the intro for [[outsider innovation]] ([[broadcast search]]) is the case of [[John Harrison]] solving the "longitude problem"

            - Here, the long time lag (~[60 years!](John Harrison (an outsider to the field of astronomy) invented a new mechanical method to measuring longitude at sea in 1710. This method was different from the dominant astronomical approach. It took ~60 years for this innovation to be accepted by the board of longitude in 1770 (the core of the field), because he had to pass through barriers of legitimacy, including initial resistance from the astronomers and politicians (despite initial positive reception from the navy). This internal resistance was eventually overcome by external actors intervening, such as the royal society (which influenced the astronomers), and the monarchy (which influenced the politicians).)) and serious challenges John faced in getting his idea accepted (as discussed by [[@cattaniDeconstructingOutsiderPuzzle2017]])

            - This is really useful to think about with [[Matt Clancy]]: if there really is some kind of ["sweet spot"]([[[[CLM]] - There is a 'Sweet Spot' in Analogical Distance. Somewhat far analogies lead to better creative outcomes than very near or very far analogies]]) of analogical distance, it is actually possible that "near citations" are... more performative (or social / framing / narrative) than causal for the innovation itself

                - see, e.g., [[@cattaniInnovatorsActsFraming2020]]

                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FNi-B5MKcce.png?alt=media&token=4679efb3-3ba6-4cdd-8c20-2803c746af6a)

                    - what's interesting too is that there might be a tension in the other direction as well: under some conditions, it may be more advantageous to "dress up" your explanations of your innovation with far (perhaps more familiar?) analogies than were actually used to generate your idea (see [[@sanerAnalogiesOutBlue1999]])

        - ALSO! Important to state here: we can't rule out the possibility that the solutions that ended up being proposed were "near" (drew primarily from domain knowledge or didn't involve outside concepts): so it could be that it was *ALL* perspectives, no heuristics. We can't tell.
