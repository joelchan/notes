        - Abstract

            - We examine who the winners are in science problem-solving contests characterized by open broadcast of problem infor-mation, self-selection of external solvers to discrete problems from the laboratories of large research and development intensive companies, and blind review of solution submissions. Analyzing a unique data set of 166 science challenges involving over 12,000 scientists revealed that technical and social marginality, being a source of different perspectives and heuristics, plays an important role in explaining individual success in problem solving. The provision of a winning solution was positively related to increasing distance between the solvers field of technical expertise and the focal field of the problem. Female solversknown to be in the outer circle of the scientific establishmentperformed significantly better than men in developing successful solutions. Our findings contribute to the emerging literature on open and dis-tributed innovation by demonstrating the value of openness, at least narrowly defined by disclosing problems, in removing barriers to entry to nonobvious individuals. We also contribute to the knowledge-based theory of the firm by showing the effectiveness of a market mechanism to draw out knowledge from diverse external sources to solve internal problems.
