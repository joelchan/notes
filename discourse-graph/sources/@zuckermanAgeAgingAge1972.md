- [[@zuckermanAgeAgingAge1972]] for [[[[QUE]] - (How) do fields of innovation vary in their legibility of quality?]]

    - #inspectionalread

        - key concepts:

            - codification (this is what was referenced in [[@coleHierarchySciences1983]])

            - gerontocracy (presumably this refers to the dominance of science by the older)

            - obsolesence

                - related to "half-life of facts" [[@arbesmanHalfLifeFactsWhy2012]]?

        - section 2 on age stratification and the codification of scientific knowledge is the most relevant, so i'll focus on that

    - #lit-context

        - coming from [[Sociology]]

    - core focus of chapter is on age-related dynamics in science - science as a "young man's game". cross-check with:

        - [[@simontonVarietiesScientificCreativity2009]] for age-related dynamics (there might be a more precise cite)

        - [[@jonesAgeGreatInvention2010]] seems to have contradictory results: that the balance of power has shifted from the young to the old in comparison to Zuckerman's time

        - connection to age structure suggests a hypothesis too for a convergent/alt measure of [[Legibility]]: age structure (where, all things being equal, fields where great achievements occur later have lower rates of legibility; takes longer to get to the frontier)

    - generally what they seem to be arguing

    - core definitions of [[codification]] on pp. 303-305

        - connects to [[obsolescence]]

        - family resemblance

        - connects to degree of [[degree of empiricism, after Conant]] (more codified = less empiricist)
