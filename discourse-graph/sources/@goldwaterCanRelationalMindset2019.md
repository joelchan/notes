“…In summary, although neither experiment 1 nor experiment 2 alone replicate the pattern from Vendetti et al (2014) exactly, combining the results of experiments 1 and 2 show quite similar values to the prior research. This raises our confidence that the current experiments successfully tapped into the same cognitive processes as Vendetti et al (2014), while highlighting the need to compare the magnitude of relationships across conditions without relying on a difference between a statistically significant versus nonsignificant finding.…”

    - the trail goes cold here..... :( no more follow-up supporting or opposing cites. we have stopped with two sets of studies with western undergrads!!!!!
