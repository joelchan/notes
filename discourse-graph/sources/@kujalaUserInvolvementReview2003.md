        - Abstract

            - User involvement is a widely accepted principle in development of usable systems. However, it is a vague concept covering many approaches. This study ®rst clari®es the nature of user involvement and its expected bene®ts, and secondly reviews three streams of research, to evaluate the bene®ts and problems of varied user involvement approaches in practice. The particular focus of this study is on the early activities in the development process. An analysis of the literature suggests that user involvement has generally positive eects, especially on user satisfaction, and some evidence exists to suggest that taking users as a primary information source is an eective means of requirements capture. However, the role of users must be carefully considered and more cost-ecient practices are needed for gathering users' implicit needs and requirements in real product development contexts.

- processing [[@kujalaUserInvolvementReview2003]]

    - is kind of a light review (not really anything new AFAIK), and focused a lot more on benefits than barriers

    - but Table 2 has like 4 studies across 3(?) papers that we can write `observation notes` from

    - so let's do that

        - {{[[TODO]]}} [[AJ Rudd Jr]] do the analog version of the observation notes

        - {{[[TODO]]}} [[Joel Chan]] will add this to zotero and roam

        - {{[[TODO]]}} [[AJ Rudd Jr]] will transfer in from analog-land
