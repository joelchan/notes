        - Abstract

            - Semantic publishing has significant potential to transform scholarly work. While much progress has been made on conceptual models and technical infrastructure, authorship remains an open problem. Here, we explore whether and how semantic publishing labor might be integrated into the existing practices of scholars reading and synthesizing the literature. From a series of studies of scholars, we observe rich practices across a variety of workflows and tool ecologies that overlap with key aspects of semantic publishing: 1) creating granular knowledge artifacts (\rcompress{}), extracting and specifying provenance and contextual details (\rcontext{}), and 3) specifying semantically typed entities and relations between knowledge units (\rcompose{}). We discuss implications of these findings for developing sustainable, scholar-powered models of semantic publishing.

- Yet, there are some hints of optimal paths, that on closer analysis, seem to align with the epistemic models [[@qianOpeningBlackBox2020]] [[@chanWhereRubberMeets2020]]

        - What we see now is not infrastructure for synthesis. Instead, we see people either resort to all sorts of "hacks" and workarounds, or put in a substantial amount of work to "mine" publications for what they need (for an evocative example of this, see [[@knightEnslavedTrappedData2019]]). We have a whole cottage industry that is dedicated to fueling workarounds of this sort, for systematic reviewing. While these hacks often work well enough for the task at hand, they are rarely transferred in systematic ways across projects and people, violating the dimensions of "reach or scope" and "embodiment of standards", laid out by [[@starStepsEcologyInfrastructure1996]].
