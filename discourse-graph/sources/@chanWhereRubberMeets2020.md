        - Abstract

            - Semantic publishing has significant potential to transform scholarly work. While much progress has been made on conceptual models and technical infrastructure, authorship remains an open problem. Here, we explore whether and how semantic publishing labor might be integrated into the existing practices of scholars reading and synthesizing the literature. From a series of studies of scholars, we observe rich practices across a variety of workflows and tool ecologies that overlap with key aspects of semantic publishing: 1) creating granular knowledge artifacts (\rcompress{}), extracting and specifying provenance and contextual details (\rcontext{}), and 3) specifying semantically typed entities and relations between knowledge units (\rcompose{}). We discuss implications of these findings for developing sustainable, scholar-powered models of semantic publishing.
