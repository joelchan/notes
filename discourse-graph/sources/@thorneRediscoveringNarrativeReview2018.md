- later [[Sally Thorne]] follows up on this to say "let's rediscover the narrative review! [[@thorneRediscoveringNarrativeReview2018]]

    - reminds me of [[@suriAdvancementsResearchSynthesis2009]]'s point about the need to deal with heterogeneity in the evidence types and assumptions, not just integrate over RCTs or something.

    - [[@greenhalghTimeChallengeSpurious2018]] then cites [[@thorneRediscoveringNarrativeReview2018]] to critique the fetishizing of systematic reviews, noting that (similar ot my point), #CLlaim [[[[CLM]] - [[systematic review]]s are typically narrowly focused, and provide less insight]].
