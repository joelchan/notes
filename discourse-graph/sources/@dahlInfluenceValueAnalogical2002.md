        - Abstract

            - Although both the academic and the trade literature have widely acknowledged the need to foster the development of more-innovative products, little empirical research has examined the cognitive processes underlying the creation of these novel product concepts. In this research, three empirical studies examine how analogical thinking influences the idea-generation stage of the new product development process. The first study uses the verbal protocols of real-world industrial designers to trace the role of analogy in the context of a new product development task, and the second and third studies use an experimental approach to assess the effectiveness of different ideation strategies and conditions. Findings from these studies indicate that the originality of the resulting product design is influenced by the extent of analogical transfer, the type of analogies used, and the presence of external primes. In addition, these studies reveal a positive relationship between the originality of the product concept and consumers' willingness to pay for it, an important measure in the concept- testing phase of product development.

        - Study 2: use an experimental approach to assess H1-H3 about the effectiveness of different ideation strategies and conditions

            - 3 Hypotheses

                - H1: More-original designs will be produced when no external cue is provided and there is encouragement to use as many analogies as possible. (**supported**)

                    - [[[[EVD]] - Student subjects in the no prime (example)/multiple base of analogies condition produced designs that were statistically more original than the other combinations of w/ and w/o primes and single base/multiple bases of analogies. - [[@dahlInfluenceValueAnalogical2002]]]]

                - H2: The presence of an external cue will moderate the relationship between access strategy and the number of analogies accessed. Specifically, when instructed to use a multiple access strategy, people viewing an external prime will access fewer base domains than will those who do not view an external prime. (**not supported**)

                - H3: The presence of an external prime will increase the likelihood that the new design shares the same form as the prime. (**supported**)

        - Study 3: use an experimental approach to assess H4-H6 about the effectiveness of different ideation strategies and conditions

            - 3 Hypotheses

                - H4: The higher the proportion of far analogies used in a design task, the greater is the originality of the resulting design. (**supported**)

                - H5: When the use of multiple base domains is recommended, a greater proportion of far analogies is accessed. (**supported**)

                    - [[[[EVD]] - Student subjects who are encouraged to access multiple base domains in the design task will access a higher proportion of far analogies than will those who are encouraged to access only one domain. - [[@dahlInfluenceValueAnalogical2002]]]]

                - H6: The greater the number of external primes provided, the lower is the proportion of far analogies accessed. (**partially supported**)
