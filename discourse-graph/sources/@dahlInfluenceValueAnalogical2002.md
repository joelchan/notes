        - Abstract

            - Although both the academic and the trade literature have widely acknowledged the need to foster the development of more-innovative products, little empirical research has examined the cognitive processes underlying the creation of these novel product concepts. In this research, three empirical studies examine how analogical thinking influences the idea-generation stage of the new product development process. The first study uses the verbal protocols of real-world industrial designers to trace the role of analogy in the context of a new product development task, and the second and third studies use an experimental approach to assess the effectiveness of different ideation strategies and conditions. Findings from these studies indicate that the originality of the resulting product design is influenced by the extent of analogical transfer, the type of analogies used, and the presence of external primes. In addition, these studies reveal a positive relationship between the originality of the product concept and consumers' willingness to pay for it, an important measure in the concept- testing phase of product development.

        - Study 2: use an experimental approach to assess H1-H3 about the effectiveness of different ideation strategies and conditions

            - 3 Hypotheses

                - H1: More-original designs will be produced when no external cue is provided and there is encouragement to use as many analogies as possible. (**supported**)

                    - [[[[EVD]] - Student subjects in the no prime (example)/multiple base of analogies condition produced designs that were statistically more original than the other combinations of w/ and w/o primes and single base/multiple bases of analogies. - [[@dahlInfluenceValueAnalogical2002]]]]

                - H2: The presence of an external cue will moderate the relationship between access strategy and the number of analogies accessed. Specifically, when instructed to use a multiple access strategy, people viewing an external prime will access fewer base domains than will those who do not view an external prime. (**not supported**)

                - H3: The presence of an external prime will increase the likelihood that the new design shares the same form as the prime. (**supported**)

- the main result of interest for our question is the correlation between the observed dependent variable of % far analogies: [[[[EVD]] - designs that were measured during an ideation session to have come from a higher percentage of far analogies were perceived as more original and valuable by potential customer judges - [[@dahlInfluenceValueAnalogical2002]]]]

    - it's an odd choice to control for expert judge effects by making them dummies, but... ok i guess? more sensible might be to aggregate the judgments somehow. the worst thing here is that the analysis seems to be at the judgment level, not even at the design level, and i don't understand how they would compute % far at that level??? and there are no corrections or attempts to model within-design (bc these are repeated measures) OR within-person (also repeated measures) dependencies

    - this is a weak result overall, imo. i would probably have complained as a reviewer, and asked to see degrees of freedom, and/or descriptives. the relatively high p value and small effect (with no measures of variability given) make me quite nervous.

    - in any case, it's really important to note here that the far analogies were *NOT* given to the designers in a controlled fashion as stimuli, as in [[@chanBenefitsPitfallsAnalogies2011]] and similar, BUT were observed and correlated with a suboptimal statistical modeling approach. so this is essentially an observational correlational result.

                - people who saw an external near analogy prime transferred lots of form features from the design, more than control, or no prime

        - study 3: experiment (main one of interest, directly relevant results)

            - the main result of interest for our question is the correlation between the observed dependent variable of % far analogies: [[[[EVD]] - designs that were measured during an ideation session to have come from a higher percentage of far analogies were perceived as more original and valuable by potential customer judges - [[@dahlInfluenceValueAnalogical2002]]]]

                - it's an odd choice to control for expert judge effects by making them dummies, but... ok i guess? more sensible might be to aggregate the judgments somehow. the worst thing here is that the analysis seems to be at the judgment level, not even at the design level, and i don't understand how they would compute % far at that level??? and there are no corrections or attempts to model within-design (bc these are repeated measures) OR within-person (also repeated measures) dependencies

                - this is a weak result overall, imo. i would probably have complained as a reviewer, and asked to see degrees of freedom, and/or descriptives. the relatively high p value and small effect (with no measures of variability given) make me quite nervous.

                - in any case, it's really important to note here that the far analogies were *NOT* given to the designers in a controlled fashion as stimuli, as in [[@chanBenefitsPitfallsAnalogies2011]] and similar, BUT were observed and correlated with a suboptimal statistical modeling approach. so this is essentially an observational correlational result.

    - same problem across all three studies: design a new product for the commuting diner

    - summary: studies 1 and 2 aren't directly relevant to this, but study 2 (and to a certain extent study 3) to the extent that they study what influences the use of analogies, are relevant for [[[[QUE]] - What factors control whether people appropriately benefit from analogies (especially far-field ones) during creative problem solving?]]

        - study 1's basic result about the value of any analogy use could be support for the basic value of [[analogy]]

- [[@dahlInfluenceValueAnalogical2002]] for [[[[QUE]] - How might domain distance modulate the effects of analogies on creative output?]] | negative effect of being given one or more near analogies compared to nothing

    - revisiting this while synthesizing. the negative effect of being given one or more near analogies is worth separating out.

    - so, something like [[[[EVD]] - Engineering students who were given one or more near analogies as stimuli generated design ideas that were perceived as less original and valuable by potential customer judges, compared to being given no stimuli - [[@dahlInfluenceValueAnalogical2002]]]]

        - [concerns about the odd analysis choices](it's an odd choice to control for expert judge effects by making them dummies, but... ok i guess? more sensible might be to aggregate the judgments somehow. the worst thing here is that the analysis seems to be at the judgment level, not even at the design level, and i don't understand how they would compute % far at that level??? and there are no corrections or attempts to model within-design (bc these are repeated measures) OR within-person (also repeated measures) dependencies) still stand for this one
[[QUE - How might domain distance modulate the effects of analogies on creative output]]

- There is some weak [support]([[SupportedBy]]) from an early experiment from [[@dahlInfluenceValueAnalogical2002]] that everyone cites in the creativity/engineering design literature. Two core results relating to [[analogical distance]] come from the third experiment.

    - In the other case, analogical distance was not varied directly in terms of the stimuli, but was manipulated in a "one or more stimuli vs. no stimuli" way. All stimuli were near analogies. They found a __negative__ effect of the near stimuli compared to seeing nothing: [[[[EVD]] - Engineering students who were given one or more near analogies as stimuli generated design ideas that were perceived as less original and valuable by potential customer judges, compared to being given no stimuli - [[@dahlInfluenceValueAnalogical2002]]]]

    - In the one case, analogical distance was measured post-hoc from the analogies that the sample of engineering students turned out to use (think of; not given). They found a __positive__ correlation between % far analogy use and originality/value: [[[[EVD]] - designs that were measured during an ideation session to have come from a higher percentage of far analogies were perceived as more original and valuable by potential customer judges - [[@dahlInfluenceValueAnalogical2002]]]]
