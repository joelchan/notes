[[👩‍🏫 HowToSynthesis]]

- [[@templateSource]] - sources

    - most commonly academic/research literature, but can also include any specific "container" where the provenance of claims and evidence can be traced to, such as people, blogposts, tweets or videos.

    - a heuristic for this might be that anything you might cite academically is a permissible source.

    - in other words, it's about provenance (can in principle go and verify contents of CLM / EVD), and less about peer review / correctness per se.
