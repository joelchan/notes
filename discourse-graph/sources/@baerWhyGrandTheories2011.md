            - Abstract

                - The success of physics and other sciences is in many ways attributable to unifying theories that bring seemingly disparate phenomena together under a single conceptual framework. This model is inviting for creativity theorists because grand theories have great power, but there is no guarantee that any large theory can describe the many very different kinds of cognitive processes that underlie creativity in diverse domains. Trying to force creativity into an ill-fitting Procrustean bed can distort both theory and practice (such as in creativity-training programs and in creativity assessment) and in doing so cause us to misunderstand what we observe and to promote activities that may be counter-productive. Domain specificity, which argues that the skills and other factors leading to creative performance vary across domains, cautions against seeking grand, domain-general theories. Although there has been increasing interest in domain specificity in recent years, creativity researchers remain divided regarding the extent to which creativity is domain specific and the likelihood that there may be any significant domain-general factors in creative performance. Because this question is unlikely to be resolved soon and domain-specific theories of creativity are less likely to mislead us, practitioners should resist the allure of grand theories and try to understand and promote creativity on a smaller, domain-by-domain scale. Some limited general creativity meta-theories can be useful as heuristic devices to point us toward possibly productive domain-specific theories of creativity, however, if their limitations are clearly recognized and understood.
