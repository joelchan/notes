        - Abstract

            - The inufl ence of similarity on emergence in interpretations of conceptual combinations was assessed. Partici-pants wrote two denfi itions for each of eight similar and eight dissimilar word pairs and then listed the important features of each denfi ition. Those features were compared with the features collected from a different group of participants who listed the characteristic properties of the parent concepts presented individually. Features listed for the combinations but not for the parent concepts separately were considered emergent. Similar pairs led to fewer emergent features than dissimilar pairs, and rfi st attempts at denfi ing the combinations produced fewer emergent features than second attempts. Denfi itions of similar pairs more often assigned a property of one con-cept to the other, whereas denfi itions of dissimilar pairs more often identiefi d a thematic relation between the con-cepts. Similar pairs and rfi st attempts also had higher proportions of features from within the structural alignments of the combinations parent concepts. The results are consistent with the inufl ence of structural alignment on con-ceptual combination and with a q uick xfi hypothesis. Members of similar pairs, which could easily be aligned, facilitated the identicfi ation of a property of the modiefi r to project onto the head noun, and their compatible structures required little emergent modicfi ation to incorporate the projected property. Dissimilar pairs, whose structures were less readily alignable, provided fewer projectible properties, required more emergent modicfi ation to incorporate them, and more often required participants to go beyond the alignable properties of the parent con-cepts to achieve coherent interpretations. On second denfi itions, participants may have pursued less satisfactory secondary alignments that led to less property projection more emergent features.

    - the key idea here seems to be that of [[emergent properties]], which are properties that are characteristic of a combination, but not of its constituent parts - an example is the property of being a "personal electronic entry" (for a homepage), which isn't true of either homes or pages, separately.

        - this seems closely related to the idea of [[synthesis]], to be honest, regarding the idea of a [novel conceptual whole](#Claim There are two core concepts for synthesis: 1) creating a new whole from parts, and 2) displaying at least some level of __conceptual__ innovation (higher = clearer case of synthesis)) from [[@strikeTypesSynthesisTheir1983]]

    - concrete examples of [[ðŸ§± conceptual combination]]s: homepage, soccer mom, couch potato

    - two basic results are going to be about how similarity of constituent pairs for combination influence 1) form of interpretation (e.g., relation linking, property interpretation, hybridization), and 2) degree of emergence in combination

    - the base of this work on forms of interpretation is in [[@wisniewskiWhenConceptsCombine1997]]'s account based on structural alignment from [[@markmanSplittingDifferencesStructural1993]] (p. 23).

        - in this way, this work connects quite closely with [[analogy]]

        - the key theoretical idea here is that similar pairs are easier to align and identify [[Z: Alignable differences]], which leads to simpler property transfer operations; in contrast, dissimilar pairs are harder to align, so people need to construct more novel and creative scenarios that can combine the two concepts
