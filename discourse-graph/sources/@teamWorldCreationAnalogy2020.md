        - Abstract

            - The magic behind how we use GPT-3 to create worlds.

        - **How did the authors approach their questions/problems?** ((most of this is going to come from the methods sections, although some info about conceptualization of key concepts might be relevant to pull from intro/lit-review)) #lit-context

        - **What did they find?** ((keep this as contextualized as possible; resist the urge to repeat claims or generalizations)) #[[observation-notes]]

            - replicates and extends [[[[EVD]] - given one set of objects from a few classic analogies such as solar system / atom, [[sys/GPT-3]] was able to complete the corresponding objects on the other side for a few examples - [[@stayMachinamentaFormingExtended2020]]]]

            - NOTE: no sense of how often the new worlds generated were plausible!
