    - Expert often underestimate novice performance times. (They think novice perform faster than they do)

    - Expert have difficulty recalling their ability when they were novice. (They have difficulty recalling how little they knew as novice)

    - They attempt to anchor their previous performance and other performance based on their current expert performance. They would adjust down from this anchor to predict novices.

    - Because of inaccurate memories of their own novice performance, they often overestimate their ability as novice.

    - Availability bias and Anchoring

    - Case Study/Experiment
