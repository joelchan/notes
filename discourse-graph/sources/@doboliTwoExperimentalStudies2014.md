        - Abstract

            - This paper discusses the nature of concept combinations in modular design of electronic embedded systems as well as the relation between combination characteristics and novelty, quality, and usefulness of the produced solutions. Through two experimental studies, this work explored the frequency of relation-based and property-based combinations in embedded design solutions, and how the specifics of the given building blocks, i.e. salience, relatedness and number, influenced the produced combinations. The impact of popular aids, like titles and short descriptions (briefs), in improving novelty, quality, and usefulness of the designs was also analyzed. Design solutions include mostly relation-based combinations. Design novelty correlates mainly to the purpose and context of the produced combinations. Novelty is aided by titles but not by briefs.
