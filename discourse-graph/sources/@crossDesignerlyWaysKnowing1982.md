        - Abstract

            - Here, Nigel Cross takes up the arguments for a ‘third area’ of education - design - that were outlined by Archer. He further defines this area by contrasting it with the other two - sciences and humanities - and goes on to consider the criteria which design must satisfy to be acceptable must imply a reorientation from the instrumental aims of conventional design education, towards intrinsic values. These values derive from the ‘designerly ways of knowing’. Because of a common concern with these fundamental ‘ways of knowing’, both design research and design education are contributing to the development of design as a discipline.
