        - Abstract

            - Recent debate has centered on the relative promise of focusing

            - user-interface research on developing new metaphors and tools that

            - enhance users abilities to directly manipulate objects versus

            - directing effort toward developing interface agents that provide

            - automation. In this paper, we review principles that show promise

            - for allowing engineers to enhance human-computer interaction

            - through an elegant coupling of automated services with direct

            - manipulation. Key ideas will be highlighted in terms of the Lookout

            - system for scheduling and meeting management.
