        - Abstract

            - In this paper a creative design process is proposed, based on an integration between a modernised consensus view of both the design process from engineering design and the creative process from cognitive psychology. In addition, a composite definition of a creative design output is also formed, taking elements from the different design types proposed in engineering design and the creative outputs proposed in psychology. This integrated process and the composite definition are further linked, thus providing a descriptive model the different design operations are linked to the types of design output produced.
