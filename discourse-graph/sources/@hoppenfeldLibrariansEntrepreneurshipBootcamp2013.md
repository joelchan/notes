        - Abstract

            - The Entrepreneurship Bootcamp for Veterans with Disabilities is a national educational program that helps post-9/11 Veterans accomplish their dreams of starting their own businesses. Although their story has been well documented, one story that has not been told is that of a group of business librarians who support the program. The authors present unique services and resources made available to participants of this program and discuss some of the challenges, results, and future aspirations of library support.
