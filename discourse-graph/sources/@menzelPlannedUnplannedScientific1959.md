        - Reminds me of hte [[@gruberDarwinManPsychological1974]] stuff on the distinction between private, semi-private, and public knowledge. Maybne also [[Undiscovered Public Knowledge]]? cf. also [[Z: Businesses frequently prefer informal to formal sources for their information needs]]??

    - this probably causes and is caused by the cause of [[[[CLM]] - Substantial portions of knowledge that is critical for innovation are not written down]]
