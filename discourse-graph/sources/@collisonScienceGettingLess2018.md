- What I wonder is, back of the envelope: what would the load be like if we split it evenly amongst everyone who could read scientific papers? We definitely have wayyyyy more scientists than papers (published per year). Estimates I've seen are on the order of ~2-3 million papers published every year; compare: ~7-8 million full-time scientists. And as [[@collisonScienceGettingLess2018]] and others argue, [[[[CL]] - Science is getting less bang for its buck]], with part of the issue being that we are throwing wayyyyy more scientists at problems, and getting barely constant output back.

    - Thinking like a [[crowdsourcing]] person, that's a decent ratio. Of course, not every scientist will be interested in or qualified to read every paper. And not all papers are worth reading. So that changes the ratio, but not clear that it makes it worse. The issue with [[information overload]] here I think is that we're assuming we're all going it alone. There's no good way for us to share and combine our reading of papers. Again, the issue of [[[[QUE]] - How can we best bridge private vs. public knowledge?]] comes into play.
