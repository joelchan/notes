        - Abstract

            - Biologically-inspired design uses analogous biological systems to develop novel solutions for human needs. In this paper we describe an in situ cognitive study of biologically inspired engineering design. We found that biologically inspired engineering design often involves compound analogies in which a new design concept is generated by composing the results of multiple cross-domain analogies. This process of compound analogy relies on an opportunistic interaction between two processes: problem decomposition and analogical transfer. Based on this cognitive study, we also present an information processing account of compound analogies.

            - procedures: observed teams of 4-5 students, including one from biology and others from diff. enineering disciplines, worked on a design project from problem identification to final designs throughout the semester. collected data from classroom sessions, course materials, lecture content, and interactions in classrooms and in team work, with minimal intervention. projects targeted a variety of problems, including bullet-proof vests, traffic congestion, air filtratino, monitor screens, thermally adaptive fabric, and bomb detection

- Digging back into this was also substantively useful, for resurfacing the idea of "expertise mediation" as another spin on the [attribute problem]([[[[CLM]] - Core attribute (mis)matches mediate the benefits of analogies in real-world, complex problem solving]]): if I show you something from a far domain, and your understanding of that domain is shallow, it's not going to be very useful to you, probably even if it's quite thoroughly explained - what needs to happen is a fruitful iteration or co-evolution (a la [[@dorstCreativityDesignProcess2001]] and [[@helmsCompoundAnalogicalDesign2008]]) between your problem space and the other problem space

        - Where might we test something like this? In ConservationX????

        - What would we need to get started?

            - Would be easiest with academic work, can leverage citation network.

            - Just specify papers you've written, or ones you know really well, and those define your "network position"

            - Then whenever we find analogical matches that overlap with your network position, we suggest an intro between you and the seeker
