        - Abstract

            - This paper explores the impacts of the expertise level of designers during analogical reasoning. In study 1, participants were asked to select source examples and explain their selections. It was found that experts were more likely to consider Experience and Esthetics as reasons for their selections. Third-year students were more inclined to draw inspiration from Symbolism, whereas first-year students considered more about Function. Another group of participants took part in study 2, performing analogical design. The behaviors of participants during design process were coded and the behavioral frequencies as well as durations were analyzed. We conclude that experts and third-year students pay more attention to the completeness of the design, while first-year students put more efforts on the functionality of design.
