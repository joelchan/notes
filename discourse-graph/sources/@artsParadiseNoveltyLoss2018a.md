        - Abstract

            - Does a person become more or less creative when exploring a new field? Exploring new fields exposes a person to new knowledge that might increase the novelty of inventive output; at the same time, exploration means a lack of prior expertise and a learning challenge that might harm the value of that output. Using new combinations as a measure of novelty and citations as a measure of value, we demonstrate correlations between exploring new fields and increased noveltyâ€”but decreased valueâ€”in an inventorâ€“firm fixed effects panel. The negative effect of exploring new fields on value is muted when the novice collaborates with experts or uses the scientific literature in the new field. We find consistent results using an unintended change in noncompete labor law as an exogenous influence on exploring new fields. The research illustrates two opposite influences of exploration on creative output and suggests how inventors can reduce the downside of entering a new field.

    - #inspectionalread

        - correlation + natural experiment from unintended change in noncompete labor law

        - exploring new fields ++ novelty but --value (proxied with raw citations)

            - per [[@wangBiasNoveltyScience2017]] be super careful about this outcome measure of value given [long vs. short run differences for highly novel stuff]([[[[EVD]] - highly novel papers were more likely to be in the top 1% of citations in the long run, but not in the short run, and particularly in other fields - [[@wangBiasNoveltyScience2017]]]])

        - the relevance for our question here is that inventors who explore a new field (to the extent that it is different from their own) and then later go on to invent new things that are better are at least possibly (we don't know for sure) doing a form of [[far analogies]] or [[ðŸ§± conceptual combination]]: tough to distinguish.

            - i really want to watch out for whether they make any attempt to trace actual relationships between the things cited and the things proposed, *conceptually* (in content terms)

    - what did they find?

        - there's also a result here that is similar to what [[@kneelandExploringUnchartedTerritory2020]] finds re: science citations: positive effect of citing nonpatent prior art (mostly science pubs)

        - [[[[EVD]] - patents filed by inventors who was new to the patent's field tended to be more novel; this was less true if they collaborated with an expert in the new field - [[@artsParadiseNoveltyLoss2018a]]]]

        - [[[[EVD]] - patents filed by inventors who was new to the patent's field tended to receive slightly fewer citations, except when they collaborated with an expert in the new field - [[@artsParadiseNoveltyLoss2018a]]]]

    - what might this mean?

        - the results about expert collaborations in new fields reversing negative effects on forward citations (without canceling out novelty advantage) is really interesting and relevant for [[[[QUE]] - What are the most efficient routes to useful cross-boundary knowledge?]]
