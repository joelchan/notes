- Abstract:: Education is central to the acquisition of knowledge, such as when children learn new concepts. It is unknown, however, whether educational differences impact not only what concepts children learn, but how those concepts come to be represented in semantic memory‚Äîa system that supports higher cognitive functions, such as creative thinking. Here we leverage computational network science tools to study hidden knowledge structures of 67 Swiss schoolchildren from two distinct educational backgrounds‚ÄîMontessori and traditional, matched on socioeconomic factors and nonverbal intelligence‚Äîto examine how educational experience shape semantic memory and creative thinking. We find that children experiencing Montessori education show a more flexible semantic network structure (high connectivity/short paths between concepts, less modularity) alongside higher scores on creative thinking tests. The findings indicate that education impacts how children represent concepts in semantic memory and suggest that different educational experiences can affect higher cognitive functions, including creative thinking.

    - methods

        - compare montessori kids to comparable kids (wrt SES, nonverbal intelligence) from other schooling systems, 67 kids in total

        - procedures: do verbal fluency task (name as many animals in 60s), and creativity assessment (standard tasks from Evaluation of Potential Creativity)

        - measures: clustering coefficient, average shortest path length (ASPL) and modularity (Q) of estimated filtered semantic networks of the animal names from the kids

            - network construction/estimation

                - dump all responses into a participant-word matrix, so each word is a column, and each participant is a row, and each cell is 0/1 depending on whether participant mentioned the word. this is kind of like a word-document matrix. equate number of nodes across groups

                - then for each pair, look at the two "participant vectors" (i.e., the column of 1s and 0s of occurrences across participants)

                - then draw a filtered network from the similarity matrix using [[m/Triangulated Maximally Filtered Graph (TMFG)]]

                    - method is from [[@massaraNetworkFilteringBig2017]], and can be replicated using R package described in [[@christensenSemanticNetworkAnalysis2021]]

            - network metrics: clustering coefficient, average shortest path length (ASPL) and modularity (Q)

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2Fk3I3R5wz7m.png?alt=media&token=23dc3f85-456e-46f0-b403-c57ccc02b58f)

            - network estimation sampling for each group: estimate 1000 case-wise bootstrapped simulated networks from each group (basically, for each group, for 1000 times, grab N-M participants from the group, [construct the network](network construction/estimation), and then compute the [network metrics](((Z37PYNsQe))))

    - uses this [[m/Triangulated Maximally Filtered Graph (TMFG)]] method for estimating a network. it's a bit strange, but seems.... useful? roots in big data. lots of usage by [[Yoed N. Kenett]] and friends
