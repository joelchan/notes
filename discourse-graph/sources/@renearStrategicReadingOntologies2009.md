        - Describes [[sys/Textpresso]] system and other methods for integrating [[ontologies]] into the reading experience as the future of scientific reading (what it will be like in 2019)

        - #Claim Scientists read strategically by locating and extracting specific elements of interest from research papers, rather than reading in a linear fashion (p. 828-829)

            - The vision of how scientists will work with the literature in 2019:

                - "Scientists will still read narrative prose, even as text mining and automated processing become common; however, these reading practices will become increasingly strategic, supported by enhanced literature and ontology-aware tools. As part of the publishing workflow, scientific terminology will be indexed routinely against rich ontologies. More importantly, formalized assertions, perhaps maintained in specialized 'structured abstracts' (27), wil provide indexing and browsing tools with computational access to causal and ontological relationships. Hypertext linking will be extensive, generated both automatically and by readers providing commentary on blogs and through shared annotation databases. At the same time, more tools for enhanced searching, scanning and analyzing will appear and exploit the increasingly rich layer of indexing, linking, and annotation information." (p. 832)
