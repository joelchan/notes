    - #lit-context

        - special issue paper

        - a bit of an oddball venue, seems disconnected from [[CSCW]] and [[LIS]]

            - quick scan of refs suggests grounding in the european flavor of [[CSCW]] (includes [[Paul Dourish]]), connections to [[std/Hypertext]]-land, and a smattering of connections to computers and education ([[CSCL]])

        - only cited by 6, but it's only been 5 years??

    - #[[üìù lit-notes]]

        - discusses application of the concept of [[sys/Federated Wikis]] (although with a more [[P2P]] technical difference of implementation) to academic writing

    - Interestingly, discusses application of the concept of [[sys/Federated Wikis]] (although with a more [[P2P]] technical difference of implementation) to academic writing.
