    - Opening q: should we consider [[Gary  Taubes]] a "correct contrarian"?

    - Key idea I liked that made me think of our [[D/Synthesis Infrastructure]] stuff: Levels of diffusion of knowledge in a pyramid

        - "Taubes – and some of the people making the most noise about the serotonin theory of depression – seem to be ^^people trying to transfer knowledge from the highest levels of the pyramid all the way down to the base, skipping over the levels in between.^^ Does that make them contrarians playing Galileo to a hidebound establishment, or responsible science journalists relaying the establishment’s ideas more faithfully and efficiently than their predecessors? Your opinion probably depends on what narrative suits your purpose at any given time."
