        - Abstract

            - Whether as team members brainstorming or cultures experimenting with new technologies, problem solvers communicate and share ideas. This paper examines how the structure of communication networks among actors can affect system-level performance. We present an agent-based computer simulation model of information sharing in which the less successful emulate the more successful. Results suggest that when agents are dealing with a complex problem, the more efficient the network at disseminating information, the better the short-run but the lower the long-run performance of the system. The dynamic underlying this result is that an inefficient network maintains diversity in the system and is thus better for exploration than an efficient network, supporting a more thorough search for solutions in the long run. For intermediate time frames, there is an inverted-U relationship between connectedness and performance, in which both poorly and well-connected systems perform badly, and moderately connected systems perform best. This curvilinear relationship between connectivity and group performance can be seen in several diverse instances of organizational and social behavior.

        - Inefficient (diverse) > efficient in the long run [for rugged problem spaces](Made a computational model of problem solving with a linear network vs. totally connected network, and found that totally connected networks tended to converge to lower optima, and also much fewer total solutions) even though there is short-term disadvantage; [for simpler problems](((oTdVRUynO))), also short-term disadvantage, but no long-term benefit

        - For simpler problems, efficient networks of computational agents had an early advantage over the inefficient networks, which went away in the long run (equal performance for inefficient vs. efficient networks)

    - I think this means that you *want* [[synthesis]] to be good, but not perfect, at least when you're doing the work still, and if the problem is complex?

    - BUT! be careful! see this paper questioning the robustness of these computational findings and relevance to real-world scenarios of scientific discovery [[@rosenstockEpistemicNetworksLess2016]]

        - We show that previous results from epistemic network models by Kevin J. S. Zollman and Erich Kummerfeld showing the benefits of decreased connectivity in epistemic networks are not robust across changes in parameter values. Our findings motivate discussion about whether and how such models can inform real world epistemic communities.

- cites [[@lazerNetworkStructureExploration2007]], which is entry point into [this thread](Came across a series of papers that add more nuance to the idea of [[[[CLM]] - Universal Semantic Webs are neither feasible nor useful]], but this time regarding the desirability of a fully connected network with *no* friction to information sharing #[[Z]], and also relevant for [[D/Solution-Diversity]]) about the [[Zollman Effect]] (roughly: the more you know from your competitors, the worse off the global max is)

    - it's more tuned at "finding the truth", rather than ideation, so keep that in mind.
