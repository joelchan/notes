    - Method

        - Experiment 1

        - Experiment 2

    - Results

        - Experiment 1

            - [[[[EVD]] - when given a (far) analogy for numerical representations, students did no better (and possibly worse) than on a post-test than not having it - [[@vamvakoussiBridgingGapDense2012]]]] #Informs

        - Experiment 2

            - no pre-test differences

            - [[[[EVD]] - giving a bridging analogy to a far analogy for a numerical representations led to better student performance (and more robust explanations of answers) on a math post test compared to no or just the analogy - [[@vamvakoussiBridgingGapDense2012]]]] #Informs
