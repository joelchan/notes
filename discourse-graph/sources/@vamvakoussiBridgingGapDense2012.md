    - Method

        - Experiment 1

        - Experiment 2

    - Results

        - Experiment 1

            - [[EVD - when given a (far) analogy for numerical representations, students did no better (and possibly worse) than on a post-test than not having it - @vamvakoussiBridgingGapDense2012]]

        - Experiment 2

            - no pre-test differences
