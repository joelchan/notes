        - Abstract

            - Based upon research involving two intergenerational teams comprising elementary school students and adults, whose task was to design a Web portal interface for young users, the authors present a new model for designing new technologies, bbonded design.Q This model emphasizes an intergenerational partnership working towards a common goal; in this it shares similarities with the cooperative inquiry design model and its conviction that children should play an active role in the design of new technologies for their peers. At the same time, in common with the informant design model, it questions the extent to which equality can exist within an intergenerational team. Bonded design, essentially, is situated between these other two design models, sharing the former’s belief in the ability of children to work as partners in all aspects of the design process, but the latter’s reservations about the extent to which full and equal cooperation can be established across the generational divide.

    - Authors' sense of levels of equality in an intergenerational design team

        - My ordering from low to high

            - [[Informant Design]], per [[@scaifeDesigningDesigningInformant1997]]: context of educational software, and focuses on adapting [[Participatory Design]] for the reality that children will never reach full equality with adults in the same session (inherent power dynamics, and also limitations of time, knowledge, and expertise)

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FobJJjnkIgA.png?alt=media&token=baa3d649-02db-4141-82f7-fbe669b5661d)

                - I think that Scaife is essentially saying that [[[[CL]] - Some populations of users intrinsically cannot be equal partners in a design process]]

            - [[Bonded Design]] (this paper): "bonding" people with unequal power and different expertise in pursuit of a common task throughout the design process, in a way that retains their individual strengths *and* weaknesses

                - Difference from [[Informant Design]] is in the when: [[@scaifeDesigningDesigningInformant1997]] focus on just the "motivational/fun" aspects, whereas here they do it all, and throughout the design process

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FxDpKOZ7cmZ.png?alt=media&token=7a213e3a-ff6c-4501-8bf2-1abc167ec40f)![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F47qc_wBNQs.png?alt=media&token=dacdaa9a-cea6-4a76-afab-a96dda0637d5) (p. 79-80)

            - [[Cooperative Inquiry]], per [[@druinCooperativeInquiryDeveloping1999]]: expansive! children are full design partners. KidPad is proof-of-concept of the value of the approach (more flexible and creative than they would have suspected with children only as user and tester)

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F8Lp_xyxb9u.png?alt=media&token=dd178722-f3bb-490d-8e00-5edf0ef9a346) (p. 67-68)

            - [[User-centered Design]]: users are involved after technology has been designed to give feedback, can reveal design shortcomings, but can't initiate changes

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FO0qm9NKQmN.png?alt=media&token=5c8b6140-c79d-4f19-b2c2-f00777f22a39) (p. 66)

            - [[Contextual Design]] (e.g., [[Karen Holtzblatt]]): users are involved before technology has been designed, typically in their own contexts, but primarily as "data" (about the details and motivations behind their work), and help to test lo-fi early prototypes (such as [[Paper Prototyping]]), but do not directly do design or initiate changes

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FwWGui9yx41.png?alt=media&token=0690434b-2ac8-4889-bc8e-d03f9881eb8c) (p. 66)

        - Also mentioned, but I'm having trouble placing them, seem like... different things.

            - [[Learned-centered Design]]: seems like a specific instantiation of [[User-centered Design]] for learning sciences?

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FFeZ18f5rBg.png?alt=media&token=e73c1886-d97f-45b3-bfff-d795972f68b8)

            - [[Participatory Design]]: again, seems like a much higher-level construct, like a philosophy or stance, rather than a specific methodology... idk

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FRuSWgiVZnB.png?alt=media&token=6c92490e-abd4-44f9-8461-9bb5547bee32) (p. 67)

                - Cites [[@carmelPDJointApplication1993]] as description, which includes comparisons between North American and Scandinavian traditions

                    - Note that this paper is in LIS, not [[HCI]]

        - Author's ordering in Figure 1:

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FFmSB89yFsP.png?alt=media&token=761aa3be-aa90-4c16-a8c0-7cbba84a6b92) (p. 79)

            - Weird: on p67 they say that ID is between UCD and PD

    - Questions:

        - How can we think about dimensions of involvement in a more granular way?

            - Equality

            - **When** in the design process?

                - Typically after initial prototype design, feedback used to inform final concept

            - **What** is the nature of users' input?

        - What is a "useful" level of granularity for us? Clearly the different "things" can intermix in a single PD effort! What makes something CD instead of PD? What's the analog to, say, the distinction between method, methodology, and epistemology in research methods (see, e.g., crotty)?

    - Observations #[[➰ breadcrumbs]] turn into evidence notes

        - Low response rate from Grade 3 not for lack of interest but due to clashes with sports activities that were scheduled

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FxWXz8Bbq3P.png?alt=media&token=f4e74aa7-ed40-4cc9-9104-fdf8941dfea8) (p. 69)

            - This reminds me very much of [[[[EVD]] - Children from underserved communities were often unable to attend in-lab PD sessions due to travel and time constraints - [[@walshEquityEqualityAmerican2018]]]], which literally had the same thing about extracurricular sports.

                - I wonder about the changing significance of these activities as you move between socioeconomic and other dimensions of marginalization - how "optional" are these?

        - Felt they had to keep the numbers low for Grade 3 specifically due to greater requirements for individual attention that were uncovered during pre-testing - recommended a ratio of one adult to two children; this was also borne out in their deployments (e.g., one girl found socialization difficult, and needed one dedicated adult member)

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F1gDzh9jB52.png?alt=media&token=b3f33752-f533-4f3a-b9de-0ad2c837ced2) (p. 70)

            - This reminds me of something mentioned in [[@lindsayEngagingOlderPeople2012b]] regarding ratio. In fact, I think it's cited for this?

        - Felt they had to randomly select rather than purposefully select for certain characteristics, for ethical and legal approval reasons

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F-jRNdyXJmk.png?alt=media&token=95d8a642-a625-4ee7-b965-16b39e64c248) (p. 71)

        - Chose to keep number of sessions relatively low (~9-12) total, bc they were concerned about sustaining interest; got feedback from the children that they could have done more, but limiting factor was scheduling conflicts with other activities (e.g., esp. sports)

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FSRGfhAgG1T.png?alt=media&token=8fc7cb2f-cedc-4428-b8c2-13b170e4214f) (p. 72)

        - Concerns about power dynamics of doing it in the school (adults --> teachers), but didn't get any specific observations that this was happening; also felt necessary to do in school due to safety, security, and transportation concerns

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FpXIQ4au8Sg.png?alt=media&token=acf7dd11-8554-4042-92d4-ca63d40eb231) (p. 72-73)

        - Some deliberate choices around attire and practices to reinforce equality and ease (e.g., casual dress, address adults by first name, don't raise hands like in teacher-classroom situation)

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FS6loIdhd0h.png?alt=media&token=2e622c02-5672-4163-9b17-9d9364521b4e) (p. 74)

        - Possible paradox: as children progress in the design process, they become less representative of their peer group (think more like designers, than just children?)

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FrxO_043f6M.png?alt=media&token=631eebc0-e391-4688-97b9-25bff8eeb889)

            - Not sure how important this is

        - Upper limit to equality: adults were clearly "in control" (set agenda/timing/etc., reimposed order if they went out of control)

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FyqQIHKJmg0.png?alt=media&token=363fccbc-7ab9-4fa5-8653-3b797e503521) (p. 78)

    - Deploy grounding context

        - Context: two intergenerational teams (3 researchers across all, one with eight Grade 6 students, one with six Grade 3 students), operating in a public elementary school in a middle-class Canadian suburb, designing Web portals to find information for class-based projects. The design project was informally perceived as a success in terms of the output design prototype being preferred to Google/MSN by the users (no formal eval yet).

            - [[Elizabeth Bonsignore]] anecdotally, range of 6-11 seems best for [[Cooperative Inquiry]] due to balance between ego and consciousness

        - what dimensions of users are useful to think about with expanding boundaries of PD?

            - the authors' idea of knowledge, and expertise

            - scheduling issues is pervasive issue

            - "autonomy"? **extra stakeholders** that are ubiquitously present: potentially extra agendas to navigate. this varies

                - [[[[EVD]] - Black and LatinX codesign participants were reluctant to fully disclose past experiences bc they perceived researchers as connected to outsider authorities who could harm them - [[@harringtonDeconstructingCommunityBasedCollaborative2019]]]]

    - the bit about "go o them vs. have them come to you" gets complicated again

        - notice here [[@harringtonDeconstructingCommunityBasedCollaborative2019]] warns about the potential impact of harm from doing things "on-site"

- might put an upper limit on how deep you can go, e.g., stuck at the "informant level", per [[Bonded Design]] [[@largeBondedDesignNovel2006]] and the onion model

    - inescapable power dynamics between adults and children

    - shorter (weeks vs. a year +), ad-hoc design teams (vs. [[Cooperative Inquiry]])

        - this means the participants are only involved in narrower slices of the design process
