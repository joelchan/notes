    - Model: Uses productivity (Number of car produce per hour) which also indicate the cost of labors for each car as a proxy to see knowledge transfer

        - Model also includes

            - Knowledge depreciation (function of time)

            - Total knowledge transfer from shift a to b and b to a

            - Proportion of knowledge transfer on the day from shift a to b and b to a.
- 
- Notes:

    - RQ: Whether there is a difference in knowledge acquisition and transfer in car manufacturing plants with n number of shifts?

    - Setting: Car manufacturing plants (Single Shift and Two Shift)

    - 4 Model w/wo constrainst were explored

        - b indicated constraint parameters

    - Results

        - Result shows that all the knowledge are carry across the shift. $$\rho_1$$ and $$\rho_2$$ are the total knowledge carry over from shift 1 to 2 and shift 2 to 1, respectively

        - (Model 4 with no constraints) However, the rate of transfer is different for shift 1 to 2 (day to night) and shift 2 to 1 (night to day).
