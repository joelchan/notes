    - Model: Uses productivity (Number of car produce per hour) which also indicate the cost of labors for each car as a proxy to see knowledge transfer

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FPYz7V4a5UB.png?alt=media&token=e3dc9b2a-cf5b-4272-8d79-b8a859f98bbe)

        - Model also includes

            - Knowledge depreciation (function of time)

            - Total knowledge transfer from shift a to b and b to a

            - Proportion of knowledge transfer on the day from shift a to b and b to a.
- 
- Notes:

    - RQ: Whether there is a difference in knowledge acquisition and transfer in car manufacturing plants with n number of shifts?

    - Setting: Car manufacturing plants (Single Shift and Two Shift)

    - 4 Model w/wo constrainst were explored

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FPV00kIeWAB.png?alt=media&token=0925263f-6dff-4b26-b6ad-ed5cfca12feb)

        - b indicated constraint parameters

    - Results

        - Result shows that all the knowledge are carry across the shift. $$\rho_1$$ and $$\rho_2$$ are the total knowledge carry over from shift 1 to 2 and shift 2 to 1, respectively

        - (Model 4 with no constraints) However, the rate of transfer is different for shift 1 to 2 (day to night) and shift 2 to 1 (night to day).

    - Case Study of making pizza was not in this paper, despite being cited. We tracked it down to [[@darrAcquisitionTransferDepreciation1995]], but even here it's not actually a result, but a contrived example

        - Harder to share how to hand-toss a pizza (tacit) than to share the cook time of different pizza (explicit)

        - Experts usually only tell part of the story (explicit part) about task that require tacit knowledge (hand-tossing a pizza)

- [[@eppleEmpiricalInvestigationMicrostructure1996]] speculated that transfer can be deliberaly facilitated through managerial and engineering attention

- discussed [[@eppleEmpiricalInvestigationMicrostructure1996]] and [[@darrAcquisitionTransferDepreciation1995]] for [[D/KNEXT]]

    - takeaways:

        - transfer happens

            - more easily between commonly owned store than differently owned store [[@darrAcquisitionTransferDepreciation1995]]

        - mechanism of transfer is not specified in these studies, due to the nature of the data

            - In [[@darrAcquisitionTransferDepreciation1995]], transfer can could happen because of more frequent meeting between commonly owned store than differently owned store.

        - Potential new mechanism of transfer for tacit knowledge other than writing it down (bad way) or apprenticeship (expensive way)

            - Embodied, Embedded (Plans and Situated Actions)

                - For example, flashing light in a manufacturing plant to indicate something is wrong in the belt. Everyone at the plant knows what to do when this happens.

            - Artifacts (Affordances of the object could tell people how to use the tools without instructions)

                - Imitation and tool usage.
