- Abstract:: We investigate the way Post-It notes support creative design team practice, focusing on how they function as cognitive externalisations that, through grouping activities, support categorisation qualities associated with semantic long-term memory. We use a multimodal approach, drawing on ethnomethodology and conversation analysis, which places gestures and interactions with Post-It notes on a similar footing to speech and text. This highlights the role of these interactions in the situational context, as the design team shape and are shaped by them. Following Dix and Gongora (2011), we identify four overlapping functions: informational, formational, transformational and transcendental. We then examine the emergence of concepts and themes through grouping individual Post-It notes, showing how they might be considered nodes in an emerging semantic network.

- Research on collaborative creativity has shown that task-appropriate artifacts and systems, design artifacts such as prototypes [[@hargadonTechnologyBrokeringInnovation1997]] and post-it notes [[@doveGroupingNotesNodes2018]], or group decision-support software for mapping out issues [[@selvinConstructingKnowledgeArt2014]][[@ariasEnvisionmentDiscoveryCollaboratory2015]]  can significantly augment people's ability to co-create powerful new ideas with others.
