        - Abstract

            - When does history begin? What characterizes it? This brilliant and beautifully written book dissolves the logic of a beginning based on writing, civilization, or historical consciousness and offers a model for a history that escapes the continuing grip of the Judeo-Christian time frame. Daniel Lord Smail argues that in the wake of the Decade of the Brain and the best-selling historical work of scientists like Jared Diamond, the time has come for fundamentally new ways of thinking about our past. He shows how recent work in evolution and paleohistory makes it possible to join the deep past with the recent past and abandon, once and for all, the idea of prehistory. Making an enormous literature accessible to the general reader, he lays out a bold new case for bringing neuroscience and neurobiology into the realm of history.

    - Back to the source itself, the concept of [[ghost theories]] isn't super well-defined, just sort of loosely invoked to explain resistance to the author's unorthodox ideas about the connection between history and biology (or "deep history")

        - AFAIK, can trace it to two sections of the book:

    - At first glance from title, seemed like a mistake?

        - And googling doesn't really show up much

            - Except this random section in this book on cognitive archaeology, which extends this as an observation on science in general, even though the book is not in any way set up to test or advance that claim!
