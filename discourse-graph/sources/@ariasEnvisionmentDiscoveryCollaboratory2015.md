- __The Envisionment and Discovery Collaboratory (EDC): Explorations in Human-Centered Informatics__ â€” [[@ariasEnvisionmentDiscoveryCollaboratory2015]]

    - Nice summary of the work that [[Gerhard Fischer]] [has been doing ]([[Gerhard Fischer]] did some really nice stuff that's counter to formality considered harmful [[@shipmanFormalityConsideredHarmful1999]] for community deliberation - what's the lightweight [[sys/IBIS]] experience?)related to [[D/Synthesis Infrastructure]]

    - Together with [[@liddoContestedCollectiveIntelligence2012]]'s [[sys/Compendium]], more real-world #example-of and #system-for [[synthesis]]

- Research on collaborative creativity has shown that task-appropriate artifacts and systems, design artifacts such as prototypes [[@hargadonTechnologyBrokeringInnovation1997]] and post-it notes [[@doveGroupingNotesNodes2018]], or group decision-support software for mapping out issues [[@selvinConstructingKnowledgeArt2014]][[@ariasEnvisionmentDiscoveryCollaboratory2015]]  can significantly augment people's ability to co-create powerful new ideas with others.

    - Key cites for this include the work of [[Simon Buckingham Shum]] as well as [[Gerhard Fischer]]

- Important exception that we build on: [[Gerhard Fischer]]'s stuff, though again that was not for science - was targeting communities of interest. His name keeps coming up, need to collect his stuff. It's not just [[@ariasEnvisionmentDiscoveryCollaboratory2015]]

    - Core insight from here is about the "[[domain-specific language (DSL)]]"

        - key paper was [[@fischerTurningBreakdownsOpportunities1994]] articulating this insight

        - embedded in larger project described in [[@fischerSocialCreativityTurning2004]] for fostering [[communities of interest]]
