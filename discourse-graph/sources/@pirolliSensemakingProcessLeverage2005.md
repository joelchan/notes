- Context

    - #canonical paper for sensemaking, mostly for [[Notional Model of Sensemaking]]
- Notes/claims

    - [[Notional Model of Sensemaking]] in intelligence analysis has a looping structure that loops both between and within foraging and sensemaking loops, and progressively increases in both structure and effort, starting from raw data sources and culminating in a synthesized set of hypotheses #[[üìù lit-notes]] (p3)
