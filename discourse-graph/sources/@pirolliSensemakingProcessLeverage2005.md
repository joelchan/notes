- Context

    - #canonical paper for sensemaking, mostly for [[Notional Model of Sensemaking]]
- Notes/claims

    - [[Notional Model of Sensemaking]] in intelligence analysis has a looping structure that loops both between and within foraging and sensemaking loops, and progressively increases in both structure and effort, starting from raw data sources and culminating in a synthesized set of hypotheses #[[üìù lit-notes]] (p3)

###### Discourse Context

- **Informs::** [[CLM - Sensemaking requires iterative loops of (re)interpreting data in light of evolving schemas]]
- **Informs::** [[CLM - Composability is necessary for synthesis]]
- **Informs::** [[QUE - What (existing) systems facilitate individual synthesis]]

- Although efforts like #[[@russellBeingLiterateLarge2006]] and #[[@russellCostStructureSensemaking1993]] and #[[@pirolliSensemakingProcessLeverage2005]] seem to target more **__process__**-level frictions, and not as much the data model / artifacts themselves.

    - Slight exception from #[[@russellBeingLiterateLarge2006]]: Good example on p5: if "moving" a paper is costly, people do it a lot less

    - Can still polish, but I think the steps are there
