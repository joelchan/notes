- Returned to OG [[sys/gIBIS]] system writeup: [[@conklinGlBISHypertextTool1988]] - gotta come back to this #[[âž° breadcrumbs]]

    - So many similarities and insights in terms of user problems!

        - Keeping up with change

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FgXaRzBEHDU.png?alt=media&token=3539d77b-2181-4bb6-a3a4-f3a35c8ba094)

        - Macro / global context, graph overview meh

        - Need space for meta

        - Need context

        - Need grounding in evidence cc [[[[[[CLM]] - Synthesis work requires explicit (usually external) representations of both evidence and claims]]

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FuAzgE2QrGg.png?alt=media&token=8aafe20c-4142-4b40-8b1d-b6bcf72fb167)

        - Similarly, need to track state (cc I am reluctant to make them, and I sometimes feel like I made them too hastily, leading to [noise](((dsqBxyGpc))). )

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FZKSMWLG4J0.png?alt=media&token=e09a165b-247f-4271-af66-89e4b8bf2fdb)

            - There must be space for free-form speculation and free-floating fleeting notes. This is everything else in Roam. It is the chaos that only I can surf. And that is ok.

            - Really hitting the theme of how important it is to have the informal live alongside the formal: asked about [[abduction]], and where that lives in here - my sense is that [[[[PTN]] - discourse graph]] don't represent abduction, but support it (by having something to talk back to); similar to [[Chinmay Kulkarni]]'s question about speculation

        - Need to leave sapce for speculation, informality, [[[[CLM]] - (premature) formalism considered harmful]]

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FDwu9DFCvtF.png?alt=media&token=04e7f1f2-b197-4198-9efe-f81023857462)

    - And same value prop we are seeing with [[[[EXP]] - [[D/Synthesis Infrastructure]] - Field study for discourse graph extension]]: value from the explicit rhetorical structure focusing thinking

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FMkv-FiawcY.png?alt=media&token=48ba709a-feab-4878-a27d-248254c43239)

    - This is also a model paper for the [[outline/[[D/Synthesis Infrastructure]] - discourse graphs paper]]

    - And illustrates the generality of the d/graph - I can *definitely* implement literally an [[sys/IBIS]] in Roam. 100%. And I would probably overcome a good deal of the [issues](So many similarities and insights in terms of user problems!) identified too! and can esp. naturally [ground in evidence](((ONDLFvTa-))), through mapping to the argument nodes!!!!

        - This is v similar to what [[Eirini Maliaraki]] and [[Dominic Falcao]] want to do at [[org/Deep Science Ventures]]: model is logic model about assumptions, constraints, etc., that they want to ground in evidence to inform their judgments of risk/uncertainty/opportunity - can absolutely sit on top of the d/graph
[[March 24th, 2022]]

- and this is also articulated quite well in [[@conklinGlBISHypertextTool1988]]
