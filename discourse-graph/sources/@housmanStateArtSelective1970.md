        - Abstract

            - This paper condenses the results of a detailed survey of 100 SDI systems throughout the world, conducted this year by the American Society for Information Science. The text develops the concept of SDI as a computerized method to provide for the effective flow of technical information among scientific workers. The current status of SDI in university, industrial, and government environments is analyzed and placed in historical perspective, with possible future trends developed particularly those that might affect the form of tomorrow's technical information media.
