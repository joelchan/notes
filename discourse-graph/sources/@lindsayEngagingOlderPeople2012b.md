        - Abstract

            - The use of digital technologies is increasingly proposed in health and social care to address the aging population phenomenon but, in practice, the designers of these technologies are ill equipped to design for older people. We suggest participatory design as an approach to improving the quality of design for older people but, based on previous work and our own experiences, identify four central issues that participatory design approaches need to address. We describe an approach to early engagement in design with older people that address each of these issues and some of our experiences applying the approach in a variety of different design projects. We conclude by discussing some of the issues that have been highlighted when attempting to apply this approach in different design contexts and the issues that have been raised when working with partners who are less committed to the idea of engaging with older adults in participatory design.

    - the central results of this paper are central to our question:

        - has at least claims about ways to make [[Participatory Design]] more inclusive (towards older adults)

        - but also a novel approach that addresses these issues, plus empirical evidence of the utility of the approach

        - these deployments in turn generate yet more empirical evidence that points to issues to design for to increase inclusivity

        - discusses the [[social model of disability]] that claims an important distinction between impairment and disability: the former is a biological fact, but the latter is a function of the social context, including the design of the environment and tools

    - methods notes

        - Research team tested a new design approach, the [[sys/OASIS design approach]] with a set of older adults, aimed at three domains: 1) designing digital technology to promote healthy eating, 2) personal mobility, and 3) promoting feelings of personal security in the home.

        - Their focus on older adults was to work with the full range of diversity of the 65+ age group. The researchers did not report specific demographic statistics or information about the older adults they worked with (from which their results are based), but they did report that their sample was more mobile than the typical older population

        - The Exploratory session component was structured and derived from the Task Analysis Framework, and involved 15 minutes of information gathering, 10 minutes of prompt viewing, 20 minutes of scenario generation, 20 minutes of claims analysis, 30 minutes of feature envisioning, and 30 minutes of scenario envisioning
