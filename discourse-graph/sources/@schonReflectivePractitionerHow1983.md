    - > ...although problem setting is a necessary condition for technical problem solving, it is not itself a technical problem. When set the problem, we select what we will treat at the "things" of the situation, we set the boundaries of our attention to it, and we impose upon it a coherence which allows us to say what is wrong and in what directions the situation needs to be changed. Problem setting is a process in which, interactively we __name__ the things to which we will attend and __frame__ the context in which we will attend to them (p. 41)

        - great #quotes for [[problem (re)formulation]]

        - this noticing here reminds me very much of [[[[EVD]] - Representing a mutilated checkerboard in a way that made perceptual features of squares more salient facilitated problem reformulation and insight - [[@kaplanSearchInsight1990]]]]
[[CLM - Design proceeds by co-evolution of problem and solution space]]

- This relates also to ideas about [[Reflective Conversation with the Design Material]] [[@schonReflectivePractitionerHow1983]]

    - And more generally echoes the situated turn in cognitive science (e.g., [[@suchmanPlansSituatedActions1987]])
