- Context

    - From 2001, presented to the National Science Foundation Conference on Converging Technologies (Nano-Bio-Info-Cogno) for Improving Human Performance Dec. 3-4, 2001

    - The workshop participants ended up being the most excited about the one research goal (the Human Cognome project) that doesn't align with our priorities; go figure!

        - Didn't see anyone on the participant list from HCI
- Reading notes

    - Includes a summary of 8 major research goals to realize the promise of [[Visual Language]] for scientific discovery, and 7/8 of them align very well with ours!

        - A sampling:

            - 1: Diagram an entire branch of science with stand-alone diagrams

                - Basically a goal of creating a [[synthesis]] of a branch of science that satisfies both [[context]] and [[compositionality]]

            - 2: Create "periodic tables" of types of stand-alone diagrams

                - Similar to [[@faisalClassificationSensemakingRepresentations2009]]: #Claim There are six types of [[ðŸ§± sensemaking]] representations: 1) spatial, 2) argumentational, 3) faceted, 4) hierarchical, 5) sequential, and 6) networked (p. 2)

                - Creates a map that we can use to guide our path to [[compositionality]]

            - 3: Automatically create diagrams from text

                - Similar to  #idea from [[March 16th, 2020]] around [[Mixed-Initiative]]-powered [[[[PTN]] - incremental formalization]]

                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F5RJ73ObzKj?alt=media&token=89abf34c-7f32-47a8-91a0-6fb89a78845a)

            - 5: Create tools for collaborative mental models based on diagramming

                - Diagrams as [[[[PTN]] - boundary object]]

            - 6: Crack the unique address dilemma with fuzzy ontologies

                - Similar to our ideas around [[[[PTN]] - incremental formalization]]

            - 7: Understand computerized visual-verbal linkages

                - Again, similar to our ideas around [[Mixed-Initiative]]-powered [[[[PTN]] - incremental formalization]]

            - 8: Crack the "context" problem

                - Obvious link to our ideas about [[context]]
