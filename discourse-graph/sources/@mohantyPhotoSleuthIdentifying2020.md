        - Abstract

            - Identifying people in historical photographs is important for preserving material culture, correcting the historical record, and creating economic value, but it is also a complex and challenging task. In this article, we focus on identifying portraits of soldiers who participated in the American Civil War (1861--65), the first widely photographed conflict. Many thousands of these portraits survive, but only 10%--20% are identified. We created Photo Sleuth, a web-based platform that combines crowdsourced human expertise and automated face recognition to support Civil War portrait identification. Our mixed-methods evaluations of Photo Sleuth one month and 11 months after its public launch showed that it helped users successfully identify unknown portraits and provided a sustainable model for volunteer contribution. We also discuss implications for crowd-AI interaction and person identification pipelines.
