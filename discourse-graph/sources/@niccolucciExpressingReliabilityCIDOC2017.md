[[QUE - How can we support explicit contention with evidence when synthesizing knowledge claims]]

- [[@niccolucciExpressingReliabilityCIDOC2017]] build on the original [[std/CIDOC-CRM]] model -- developed to formally represent evidence in archeology --- and proposes using [[fuzzy logic]], formally distinct from [[[probability]]], to express [[uncertainty]] in classification of items

    - There is significant controversy still over this proposal, however; as of [[October 21st, 2020]], it's still an [open issue](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/Issue/ID-349-belief-values) in the [[std/CIDOC-CRM]] issue list

    - One [issue](https://hyp.is/ewJrXBPnEeu5POdJtyFI7w/www.cidoc-crm.org/Issue/ID-349-belief-values) is a desire to *separate* issues of being ([ontology]([[ontologies]])) from issues of knowing ([[epistemology]]):

        - There is a related rationale behind the postulation that [[std/Nanopublications]] should be absolute [[@kuhnBroadeningScopeNanopublications2013](#Claim Natural-language nanopublications should be atomic, independent, declarative, and absolute #Atomicity)]: the idea is that the claim is a statement of ontology, and we then offload expressions of [[uncertainty]] to a property
