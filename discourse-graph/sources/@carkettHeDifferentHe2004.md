        - Abstract

            - An ethnographic approach was taken to studythe creative behaviours and perceived barriers to creativity of engineers within the conceptual design department of an international aerospace company. The research project comprised three phases incorporating four studies employing qualitative research methods. A primary output of the research was the development of categories drawn from the data which exhibited barriers to creativity under micro(day-to-day experiences) and macro (larger organisational, strategic and global) conditions. A matrix explaining the complexity of interrelationships between the phenomena under investigation in relation to the conditions was developed and its structure is described in this paper.

    - #lit-context

        - conceptual design department in __leading__ aerospace company

            - long-term (15-20 years) strategic designing of aero-engines

                - i.e., not routine design

        - loss of [[perceptual knowledge]] in move to [[CAD]]?

        - the drawing board was an important site for learning and "seeing the design develop"; when it went away in favor of solitary computer work with [[CAD]], that was a major blow to creative development

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FEAJC1lWO93.png?alt=media&token=52fb1fff-a516-4f82-8500-f1bd2dfaeb38) (p. 466)

        - "star trek vision" idea comes on p. 469, has ref to [[@schonKindsSeeingTheir1992]] - sort of a "throwaway" ref that's not really expanded on in any detail

        - [[transactive memory]] is a key enabler for creativity (and things that block it are major barriers)

            - reminds me of [[communities of practice]], and also wondering if this concept is a useful one to apply to [[D/KNEXT]]

- this paper came up last time we talked: [[@carkettHeDifferentHe2004]]

    - on a slightly closer reading, it's not *SUPER* related - the focus is more broad, on many kinds of barriers to creativity, although there are some interesting tidbits in there re: [[perceptual knowledge]]

        - the drawing board was an important site for learning and "seeing the design develop"; when it went away in favor of solitary computer work with [[CAD]], that was a major blow to creative development
