    - [[Joel Chan]] discussing with [[Wei-Wei Chi]]

    - key learnings from the first two field studies of [[sys/Answer Garden]] are super releveant: we [should read]([[âž° breadcrumbs]]). that's where the evidence is. but the claim basically is that [context is necessary to make information useful]([[[[CLM]] - Knowledge must be recontextualized to be usefully reused]]), and often it's best to get that context from a person. this is the major motivation for maknig the answer garden not just a repo, but also a help-seeking platform

        - something intersting to keep in mind when we read those papers, is to consider how their users compare to ours. interesting obseration cited here is that in many cases people did *not* need context.
