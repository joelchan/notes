        - Abstract

            - Several studies have pointed out that analogy is used in architectural design. By contrast, this paper reports a study that sheds more light on how this use actually takes place, i.e. at what point in the design process, for what purpose, in what range, etc. In order to study these questions, three architects were asked to design the interior of a sailing yacht while being exposed to material on small spaces, whether or not related to boats. Analysis of these design sessions unmasks analogical reasoning as a concrete, often spontaneous, and generally profitable design strategy that is used frequently, if not constantly throughout the design process.
