        - Abstract

            - The psychology of science typically lacks integration between cognitive and social variables. We present a new framework of team innovation in multidisciplinary science and engineering groups that ties factors from both literatures together. We focus on the effects of a particularly challenging social factor, knowledge diversity, which has a history of mixed effects on creativity, most likely because those effects are mediated and moderated by cognitive and additional social variables. In addition, we highlight the distinction between team innovative processes that are primarily divergent versus convergent; we propose that the social and cognitive implications are different for each, providing a possible explanation for knowledge diversitys mixed results on team outcomes. Social variables mapped out include formal roles, communication norms, sufficient participation and information sharing, and task conflict; cognitive variables include analogy, information search, and evaluation. This framework provides a roadmap for research that aims to harness the power of multidisciplinary teams.

    - UNpacking this...

        - And we want them to happen because they could lead to [[analogy]] and information search, which ultimately gives us the outcomes of originality, elaboration, and quantity/fluency that we care about for knowledge transfer and boundary-spanning interactions.

        - There are generally two starting paths: 1) disciplinary / knowledge diversity (which maps to "who should you talk to"), and 2) formal roles (which roughly maps to structuring of the relationship, so it kind of touches on the who a bit, but not as much).

        - The path we care more about I think is the first one (at least for [[D/Computational Analogy]]): how do we get the right kind of [[task conflict]] and [[information sharing]] to happen?

        - Norms do matter, in terms of "social" factors that shape the interaction: notice the line between that and participation/information-sharing. I think this maps to the "do I like this person" and psychological safety aspects of the interaciton, which can be engineered/influenced in various ways

            - General orientation/personality (high openness to experience, low neuroticism)

            - Shared identity / common ground

            - "Chemistry"

            - Ground rules (e.g., improv: anything goes, this is the game, brainstorming (no bad ideas))

                - This makes me think of [[R. Keith Sawyer]]'s work on improv

    - My general impression is that we understand these paths a lot better for teams (and more long-lived interactions), and less so for briefer interactions which might be more tractable to engineer. I am not sure why this is true (if it is). Perhaps some of it is disciplinary fragmentation.

- Both of these are at play in regular teams, but are especially magnified in cross-boundary teams. I think? see [[@paletzSocialCognitiveFrameworkMultidisciplinary2010]]

    - There's status stuff at play, trust, adversarial, territorial dynamics

    - As well as translational problems and hierarchies of evidence and tacit knowledge

        - For that we need a representation that can bring these to the surface in a concrete way to be explicitly negotiated and used

            - In short, a [[[[PTN]] - boundary object]]!

                - It's been shown to facilitate coordination across boundaries (see review from [[@huvilaBoundaryObjectsInformation2017]], although see cautions from [[@leighstarThisNotBoundary2010]]). more stuff from [[Gerhard Fischer]] too [[@ariasEnvisionmentDiscoveryCollaboratory2015]].

                - And has been extended to the idea of design artifacts as boundary objects to facilitate [[multivoicedness]]: Design success may not involve convergence to "unite the many voices of design into one"; rather, the goal might be to find a way to let many voices live in tension and conversation, without premature resolution.  [[@bodkerDesignCollaboratoriumPlace2002]]

                    - This relates very well to [[@strikeTypesSynthesisTheir1983]]'s criterion of synthesis as clarifying, but not necessarily resolving, underlying differences in material synthesized!
