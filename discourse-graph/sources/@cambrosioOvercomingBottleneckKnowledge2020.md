            - In recent years, oncology transitioned from its traditional, organ-based approach to ‚Äòprecision oncology‚Äô centered on molecular alterations. As a result, it has become to a significant extent a ‚Äòdata-centric‚Äô domain. Its practices increasingly rely on a sophisticated techno-scientific infrastructure that generates massive amounts of data in need of consistent, appropriate interpretations. Attempts to overcome the interpretation bottleneck have led to the establishment of a complex landscape of interrelated resources that, while displaying distinct characteristics and design choices, also entertain horizontal and vertical relations. Although there is no denying that the data-centric nature of contemporary oncology raises a number of key issues related to the production and circulation of data, ^^we suggest that the focus on data use and re-use should be complemented by a focus on interpretation^^. Oncology practitioners refer to data interpretation resources as ‚Äòknowledgebases‚Äô, an actor‚Äôs category designed to differentiate them from generic, multi-purpose databases. Their major purpose is the definition and identification of¬†__clinically actionable__¬†alterations. A heavy investment in human curation, of a clinical rather than exclusively scientific nature is needed to make them valuable, but ^^each knowledgebase appears to have its own peculiar way of connecting clinical and scientific statements. In spite of their common goal^^, knowledgebases thus adopt very different approaches partly captured by the tension between trust and traceability.

                - it's a bit of an odd paper - it's not really a formal study (no methods section, no sense of field site, analysis method), though it contains numerous quotes from participants, but also many quotes from other sources (papers). i'm... not really sure what to do with it, other htan to take some light "claim" notes. things to follow up on.

                - seems to be drawing from the perspectives and lines of works like [[@suchmanPlansSituatedActions1987]]

                    - draws on suchman to talk about why knowledgebases are inherently going to be contextual and situated

                        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FZoIfp6s_wK.png?alt=media&token=b23da09e-7769-47bb-82c8-18fd1e938d81) (p. 310)

                - key thing is trying to figure out "what are these things"? distinction between databases and knowledgebases that they notice as 'actor categories' (not necessarily ontological distinctions)

                - section 1 introduces the context, section 2 is about "why we want x-bases"

                - section 3 starts to get at the heart of the hypothesized distinction between databases and knowledgebases - is this the key distinctino being made here between [[ART - CIViC]]

                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FAaRtdype4X.png?alt=media&token=9e46e8a0-4d5c-47a3-87aa-00b1ed9871f1) (p. 310)

                - should pull out the databases and knowledgebases mentioned in this paper

                    - caBIG

                    - oncology kbs

                        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FESsrh09t1s.png?alt=media&token=8ead184d-ac33-4903-9f57-d51e7800430f) (p. 311-312)

                - sections 6-10 then digs into kbs

                    - section 6 asks why the kbs were developed, from the practitioners' standpoint

                        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FYTAIXCUgAg.png?alt=media&token=48d33d80-e27b-4cef-b713-05ba70309dd3) (p. 315)

                    - section 7 discusses how the curation/creation process differs across kbs

                    - section 8 digs into issues of trust and transparency and how this is handled/manifested differently across kbs

                    - section 9 digs into interpretation, levels of evidence, and how this is done across kbs

                        - very relevant to [[QUE - How can we support explicit contention with evidence when synthesizing knowledge claims]]

                    - section 10 digs into how kbs differ at a fundamental level in terms of what they contain, their structure, etc.

                        - this is what i'm most interested in atm

                - so i think each section is going to contribute something of its own.
