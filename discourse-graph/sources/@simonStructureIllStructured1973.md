    - Title: The structure of ill structured problems

    - #canonical paper on problem solving in cognitive science

    - #> "It will generally be agreed that the work of an architect--in designing a house, say--presents tasks that lie well toward the ill structured end of the problem continuum. Of course this is only true if the architect is trying to be "creative"--if he does not begin the task by taking off his shelf one of a set of standard house designs that he keeps there... The design task (with this proviso) is **ill structured in a number of respects**. There is initially no definite criterion to test a proposed solution, much less a mechanizable process to apply the criterion. The problem space is not defined in any meaningful way, for a definition would have to encompass all kinds of structures the architect might at some point consider. ... even if we were to argue that the problem space can really be defined--since anything the architect thinks of must somehow be generated from or dredged from, his resources of memory or his reference library--some of this information only shows up in late stages of the design process after large amounts of search; and some of it shows up, when it does, almost accidentally. Hence, the problem is even less well defined when considered from the standpoint of what is actually known at any point in time than when considered from the standpoint of what is knowable, eventually..." (p. 187)

    - **A shematic diagram / a conceptual framework** within which methods for the evocation and synthesis of problem structure would alternate with problem solvers of familiar kinds in the progressive definition, refinement, and eventual solution of such problems.

- in simon's theory of problem solving (many refs, but see, eg., [[@simonStructureIllStructured1973]]; canonical cite is [[@newellElementsTheoryHuman1958]], and later on, the book: [[@newellHumanProblemSolving1972]]), it's a [[problem space]], which consists of

    - similar in [[@goelStructureDesignProblem1992]]

    - states, which is like reward model / distribution of "good" solutions?

    - operators, which are basically space of possible moves

    - tests / goal, which distinguishes constraints / requirements
