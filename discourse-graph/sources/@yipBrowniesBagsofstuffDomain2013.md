    - this bit about gap between knowledge and ability to express implementation/ideas calls to mind the [tension about layers of interpretation]([[[[CLM]] - There is a tension between analyzing participants' direct inputs, and respecting their actual insights (vs. designers' interpretation) that is intensified when working with design partners who struggle to contribute more directly to design artifacts]])

        - makes me think of the power of [[end-user programming]] as a paradigm for empowering expression

- [[@yipBrowniesBagsofstuffDomain2013]] for [[[[QUE]] - What tension points exist between the goals of diversity and depth of user participation in participatory design?]] | subject expert children with no design experience struggle with design, possible problem w/ layers of interpretation

    - methods notes

        - 3 design sessions over a ~year: 1) bags of stuff, 2) stickies, 3) layered elaboration

        - goal: co-design ScienceKit: integrated suite for communication, data collection, analysis and sharing tools

        - participants: [[KidsTeam]] children and [[sys/Kitchen Chemistry]] children and adults

    - results notes (i think most interesting to think about extending the design to the KC kids)

        - seems like more details from KC kids with bags of stuff? (4.1)

    - backstory: in [[2013]], still needed to do a lot of explaining of [[Cooperative Inquiry]] (today not so much)

    - punchline: more volume / whimsical ideas from kidsteam kids vs. kitchen science kids

        - reminds me of [[[[EVD]] - Low-income, African-American older adults perceived ideation materials used for brainstorming as infantilizing and belittling - [[@harringtonDeconstructingCommunityBasedCollaborative2019]]]]

    - give extra time to kidsteam (design experts) to get used to content before they design

    - note: the kitchen science stuff was done in school and mostly good students: could the context be inducing demand characteristics? similar to what [[@largeBondedDesignNovel2006]] worried about?

    - [[Sarah Dipasquale]]: in [[@ssozi-mugaruraSupportingCommunityNeeds2016]], saw similar theme of participants not knowing how much they really knew and could contribute

        - [[Elizabeth Bonsignore]]: "I'm not a designer"

            - does this "I'm not a designer" thing interact with (maybe get intensified by) marginalization?

                - [[Elizabeth Bonsignore]] important to counter deficit-based models; antidote is [[asset-based community development (ABCD)]] and [[funds of knowledge]] perspective: find and build up local champions

                    - some good stuff at [[CSCW]], see, e.g., [[Sheena Erete]]

        - could be influenced by power dynamics?

    - [[Salma Elsayed-Ali]] saw connection to [[@largeBondedDesignNovel2006]], where they didn't split kids into subgroups: if in this context they had done something similar (SME and design together rather than separate), what would have happened?
