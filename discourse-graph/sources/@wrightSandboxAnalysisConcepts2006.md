        - - targets many of the features we care about

            - [[[[context]]ualizability]]

                - ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/j9w1TftN_wP_e0ZcMWxbsPz7z9Fn7eVHEfs4-Q70-HCFJYwralqR329loyF2bvh-fR2bZfBfKcQa2xwKaVGy3VkbKiA8VbQkXNmnivOrD0LutL-r5wR4S-EzG0NVT1BysT2n9Ut-)

            - Progressive details (with a really fun interaction), sort of a way to support [[[[context]]ualizability]]

                - ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0Ci3sS9GyBXQ_sQ6NuLge2FzaJFQD0mPQDfroP_pZ7GSeCVCm958YGkpwJy2F2Zm53woeTzBtCsqh3fUQo1tOTKpdSvjBa36I5Ys7TYoFoY486i0q6YzJKg5ZAQ0LD82IRevLVCe)

            - [[Claim]]s with [[evidence]] ([[Atomicity]] + [[context]])

        - Notes from [[Catherine Plaisant]]

            - Look in: https://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/varepository/benchmarks.php

                - then go to Grand Challenge 2008

                - There is a video by Oculus and Palantir (have not looked now but I remember that they were good)

                - Palantir by now is probably also much improved as well (after 10+ years) :

                - Then look at the mini challenges from them as well ‚Äì in 2008

                - Then you can browse 2007 and the later years but there is so much I don‚Äôt remember where is best to look

            - In 2007 we wrote a summary article with the 3 top winners, with screen samples
