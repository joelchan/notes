- Reading [[@crossDesignerlyWaysKnowing2001]]'s notes about the distinctions between design and science (side note: probably a good idea to start a new seedling about [designerly ways of knowing]([[Z: Are there distinct designerly ways of knowing?]]))

    - Connecting this to [[D/Computational Analogy]], I keep thinking about the [[fundamental distinction between make and understand]], and how the [[far analogies]] stuff just seems to fit so much better with the "make" side of things, which seems like a designerly thing (make stuff that works!) vs. understanding the nature of something.

        - So even looking at engineering research might be barking up the wrong tree, unless they are explicitly inventive?

        - Keep thinking of how much insights were driven by [quite](other organism analogies disproportionately powered hypothesis ideation (20 vs. 3), and to a lesser extent, experiment design discussions (12 to 9), compared to within-organism analogies) [[near analogies]] in [[@dunbarHowScientistsThink1997]], and how [crossing domains is more useful for explaining something to others](((gzZQZCZV4))), but referencing familiar objects/knowledge (cf. also the stuff we did with the Mars Exploration Rover project [[@chanAnalogyStrategySupporting2012]])

        - I just can't come up with a good answer to why it makes sense to lump these together, similar to [doubts I've had in the past](do we need to be more intentional about the domain? and how much do we want to tie ourselves to abstracts if we stick with papers?)

            - Strategically, too, [[design-by-analogy]] makes so much sense, and is really an established area: perhaps with the ONR grant I now have more license to venture back into that space?

            - Suggests that if we pick up the [[P/Computational [[analogy]] Dataset]] project again (which I think is worthwhile to do!), we should do a patent one maybe. Already have clear distance metrics, and also citations.

                - The [[sys/Snorkel]] [[weak supervision]] approach might actually work even better here than with research paper abstracts!

    - There is also a potential connection here to [[P/Material Knowledge of ML for Design]], in that an [[explainable AI]]-heavy approach has such an emphasis on rigor that it feels "science-y", in contrast to a much more [conversation with the design material]([[Reflective Conversation with the Design Material]]) flavor of [[material knowledge]]

        - Starting to get a better feel for the first, conceptual paper contribution, after the style of [[@doveMonstersMetaphorsMachine2020]]
