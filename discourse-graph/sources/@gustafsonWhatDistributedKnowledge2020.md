                - > Unlike data models in most applications, which are grounded with a specific purpose and oriented in a specific context, knowledge graphs tend to be open-ended, projecting anything and everything into one space. Again, this is in the essence of their value proposition, but it means that the ontology that emerges is one that nobody actually believes in, for lack of a better phrase. Knowledge graphs are supposed to be general-purpose, but that means they are for __no-purpose__. The general purpose does not exist in the same way that the average man does not exist, and designing for and around it invites the same kind of unintended consequences. These unintended consequences can be benign or oppressive - weird quirks or systemic bias. And this is all especially sobering given that information is an increasingly relevant form of power, and that representation (i.e., ontology) is relatively subtle and difficult to change.

    - This then leads to essentially a point about [[[[CLM]] - Knowledge is fundamentally contextual]]

- This is a point that is also made by [[@gustafsonWhatDistributedKnowledge2020]] - a knowledge graph is most useful when it is big, but the bigger it gets, the bigger the temptation to make it a "[[view from nowhere]]", which is basically useless.
