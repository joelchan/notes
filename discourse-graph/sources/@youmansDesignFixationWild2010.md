- Title:: Design fixation in the wild: How physical interactions and collaboration affect fixation phenomena
- Author(s):: [[R. J. Youmans]]
- Abstract:: Design work in most domains constitutes what is known as an ill-defined problem (Simon, 1981), a problem with the potential, but not necessarily the propensity, for many different creative solutions. One of the now-recognized impediemtns to development of innovative solutions for ill-defined problems is the finding that people, including designers and engineers, tend to fixate on features of preexisting designs, and go on to generate a new design that is similar to the prior example (Stacey, Eckert & Wiley, 2002; Purcell & Gero, 1996; Smith, 1994a, 1994b, 1995a, 1995b, 2003). The work reported here outlines the results of two of my studies on design fixation. The first, currently under review, examined how working with physical prototypes affected fixation in the design work of small groups of engineering students. The second documents how very short interruptions that occur early in a design process disrupt fixation effects. A common theme to both studies is that I used them to examine variables that are often present in many stages of real design efforts in industry, but that are often intentionally removed or controlled for in laboratory studies of design fixation so that other variables of theoretical interest can be examined in isolation (e.g., incubation periods, negative fixation features, visualized fixation features, etc.)
