        - Abstract

            - This chapter synthesizes literature on multidisciplinary and multicultural creative teams. We examine the main similarities and differences between cultural and disciplinary diversity; summarize the primary, relevant theories; describe the extant literature on the relationship between team diversity and creativity, information sharing, conflict, and other factors; and point out gaps in the literature and potential future work. Diversity can benefit creativity if the underlying breadth of perspectives is harnessed, but the relationship between diversity and creativity is a complex and heavily moderated one. This chapter integrates recent advances, such as multilevel theory, the importance of shared mental models, and different aspects of creativity. In addition, this chapter highlights the importance of faultlines, or when multiple types of diversity align within the same team. Future research should take a broader systems perspective, examining factors such as type and degree of diversity, context of the team, and time/group development, among other variables.
