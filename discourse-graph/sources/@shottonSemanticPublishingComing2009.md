            - "In the present context, I define '[[semantic publishing]]' as ^^anything that enhances the meaning of a published journal article, facilitates its automated discovery, enables its linking to semantically related articles, provides access to data within the article in actionable form, or facilitates integration of data between papers^^. Among other things, it involves enriching the article with appropriate metadata that are amenable to automated processing and analysis, allowing enhanced verifiability of published information and providing the capacity for automated discovery and summarization. These semantic enhancements increase the intrinsic value of journal articles, by increasing the ease by which information, understanding and knowledge can be extracted. They also enable the development of secondary services that can integrate information between such enhanced articles, providing additional business opportunities for the publishers involved. Equally importantly, readers benefit from more rapid, more convenient and more complete access to reliable information"
