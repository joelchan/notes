    - modeling from examples can be understood as a variant of [[social learning]]. studied, for example by our very own [[@masonCollaborativeLearningNetworks2012]] and related

    - [[@baumannEffectiveSearchRugged2019]] and [[@csaszarHowMuchCopy2010]] are entry points into organizational lit that articulates variants of this relating to 'copying' / imitation - with one idea being that simple copying is different from "lossy" copying that induces/complements experential learning (making your own moves)

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F4wDf_vyvW-.png?alt=media&token=b4cad825-d5d9-4085-8289-fb5bfe1168c2) (from [[@baumannEffectiveSearchRugged2019]])

            - cites [[@lazerNetworkStructureExploration2007]], which is entry point into [this thread](Came across a series of papers that add more nuance to the idea of [[[[CLM]] - Universal Semantic Webs are neither feasible nor useful]], but this time regarding the desirability of a fully connected network with *no* friction to information sharing #[[Z]], and also relevant for [[D/Solution-Diversity]]) about the [[Zollman Effect]] (roughly: the more you know from your competitors, the worse off the global max is)

                - it's more tuned at "finding the truth", rather than ideation, so keep that in mind.

    - in our case, it's not just about learning the structure of the environment (as it's framed in social learning): it's also RESTRUCTURING the environment!!

    - this whole thread sparked by [this tweet](Antoine Coutrot on Twitter: "I'm so happy to announce our paper out in @nature today! We show that people who grew up in rural areas have better spatial navigation skills than those raised in cities, particularly for cities with grid-pattern streets. 1/12 https://t.co/mT67cZOPo2" / Twitter), triggered remindings of shared neural mechanisms between foraging in the world vs. in the mind

    - circles back to [[@hillsMindNetworkMaps2022]], what a wonderful paper!! with [[Yoed N. Kenett]] - "Is the Mind a Network? Maps, Vehicles, and Skyhooks in Cognitive Network Science"
