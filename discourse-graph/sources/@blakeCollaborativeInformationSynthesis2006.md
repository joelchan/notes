        - Abstract

            - Scientists engage in the discovery process more than any other user population, yet their day-to-day activities are often elusive. One activity that consumes much of a scientist's time is developing models that balance contradictory and redundant evidence. Driven by our desire to understand the information behaviors of this important user group, and the behaviors of scientific discovery in general, we conducted an observational study of academic research scientists as they resolved different experimental results reported in the biomedical literature. This article is the first of two that reports our findings. In this article, we introduce the Collaborative Information Synthesis (CIS) model that reflects the salient information behaviors that we observed. The CIS model emerges from a rich collection of qualitative data including interviews, electronic recordings of meetings, meeting minutes, e-mail communications, and extraction worksheets. Our findings suggest that scientists provide two information constructs: a hypothesis projection and context information. They also engage in four critical tasks: retrieval, extraction, verification, and analysis. The findings also suggest that science is not an individual but rather a collaborative activity and that scientists use the results of one analysis to inform new analyses. In Part 2, we compare and contrast existing information and cognitive models that have inadvertently reported synthesis, and then provide five recommendations that will enable designers to build information systems that support the important synthesis activity.

        - some types of [[context]] information were more contextual, depending on the particular "hypothesis projection" of the review, which varied across the lifecycle of the project studied (e.g., location of medical condition, amount of exposure, confounding risk factors), while others were more constant regardless of hypothesis (e.g., study- and population-context information)

        - authors think that there is enough regularity in the types and locations of [[context]] information that we could build an automated system to extract htese bits of information, which would in turn enable exploration of a variety of hypothesis projections

            - in other words: [[[[CLM]] - Contextualizability is necessary for synthesis]] :)

            - this is self-reported estimate: based on work on knowledge work estimation (cc. also [[@russellCostStructureSensemaking1993]]), could well be an underestimate, though unclear by how much

- However, as theories of context and [[reuse]] in CSCW would predict, what specific kinds of contextual information are required for a literature review can often vary substantially across research projects. For instance, [[@blakeCollaborativeInformationSynthesis2006]] discovered in their cognitive work analysis of a team of medical researchers conducting systematic reviews that [the particulars of information needed can vary substantially by the nature of the research question](some types of [[context]] information were more contextual, depending on the particular "hypothesis projection" of the review, which varied across the lifecycle of the project studied (e.g., location of medical condition, amount of exposure, confounding risk factors), while others were more constant regardless of hypothesis (e.g., study- and population-context information)). In interdisciplinary fields such as HCI, the nature of contextual information needed to critically assess and synthesize past work can be found in handbooks like the popular "Ways of Knowing in HCI" book [[Ways of Knowing in HCI]] that includes discussions, and to a lesser extent in research methods texts, where questions of internal and external validity (which map to validity and applicability) are discussed, and the information required to judge these questions, are enumerated.
