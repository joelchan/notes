        - User don't feel equipped (i.e. don't have prior background and resources) to enter such a design process

        - Design success may not involve convergence to "unite the many voices of design into one"; rather, the goal might be to find a way to let many voices live in tension and conversation, without premature resolution.

            - They call this concept [[multivoicedness]], after [[Engestrom 1987]] and [[Bertelsen 1996]].

            - In this way, the final design artifact may not necessarily need to "solve a problem" in the narrow sense, but rather be successful if it is a good [[[[PTN]] - boundary object]] (after [[@starInstitutionalEcologyTranslations1989]])

- And has been extended to the idea of design artifacts as boundary objects to facilitate [[multivoicedness]]: Design success may not involve convergence to "unite the many voices of design into one"; rather, the goal might be to find a way to let many voices live in tension and conversation, without premature resolution.

    - This relates very well to [[@strikeTypesSynthesisTheir1983]]'s criterion of synthesis as clarifying, but not necessarily resolving, underlying differences in material synthesized!
