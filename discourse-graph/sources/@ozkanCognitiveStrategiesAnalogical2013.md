        - Abstract

            - This study investigates differences in analogical reasoning among first, second, and fourth year students and expert architects. Participants took part in an experiment consisting of four tasks: rating source examples, selecting a source domain, explaining their selection, and designing a bus stop. The results indicate significant differences among participants with respect to their soundness ratings. The results also show significant relation between level of expertise and participants' selection of source categories, the stated reasons for their selection, and the type of similarity they established between source and target. We conclude that experts preferred mental hops while first year students preferred mental leaps. Second and fourth year students preferred neither mental leaps nor mental hops but to literally copy the sources.
