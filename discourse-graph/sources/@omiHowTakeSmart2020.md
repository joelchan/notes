        - Abstract

            - üéØRoam Research is a note-taking app that works more like our brain compared to other note-taking apps like Evernote and OneNote. In this video, I talk about how to use Roam for personal knowledge management - how to learn new information, how to remember them, as well as how to take smart notes. Learning is about connecting information. Unlike other apps, Roam makes it easy for you to do exactly this, which is why I love it so much.

            - My method is based on the [[sys/Zettelkasten]] Method, invented by Niklas Luhmann.

            - If you want to know more about it, you should check out my video about the method: http://bit.ly/ZettelkastenMethod
