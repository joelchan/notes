- To be more specific: is there a way we can model and capture [[context]] snippets that target the nature / "production context" of evidence: details of the measurements that might turn out to be usefully generative (not necessarily the "type" of measurement or experiment), details of the context (e.g., [geography]([[@youngInfrastructuringCrossDisciplinarySynthetic2017]]), [culture]([[@henrichWeirdestPeopleWorld2010]]))

    - Distinct from levels of evidence, e.g., a fuzzy logic score, or an empirical support score, or a binary support/challenge relation
