        - Abstract

            - Interdisciplinary inquiry has become more pervasive in recent decades, yet we still know little about the conduct of this type of research or the information problems associated with it. This book is one of few empirical studies of interdisciplinary knowledge practices. It examines how interdisciplinary scientists discover and exchange information and knowledge, highlighting how the boundaries between disciplines affect how information is used and how knowledge is constructed. It is written for scholars and practitioners with an interest in developing information systems and research environments to foster innovative scientific work. Target groups include researchers in information science, science studies, communication, as well as research administrators and information professionals.

                - possible #observation-note-drafts

                    - scientists at the interdisciplinary research center imported information across disciplinary boundaries predominantly via **personal networks** (pp. 31, 32-35)

                        - Tom Tate (a complex systems chemist) said that when he is looking for information related to engineering, he goes directly to a colleague "I just use him. I don't have to do anything else"

                        - A device physicist at the center said that the vast majority of their information came from keeping on contact with people and going to conferences

                        - Tom Tate (a complex systems chemist) described the "oh have you looked at..." phenomenon: often they will spend a lot of time looking for relevant articles, without success, and then have someone walk into their office and recommend exactly the article they needed to see

                                - part of the value also of talking with someone was knowing what to look for when consulting a new reference (in a sentence, what is there)

                                - these recommendations tended to be quite relevant (high signal to noise ratio)

                        - Neil Nash (a Bioenergetics specialist, one of the generalists) [talked about](![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FiBahAPCE5p.png?alt=media&token=79394b8f-319d-4a2f-b9ec-99466e9ccfca) (p. 34)) how informal communication was especially helpful because their sources knew them and they had developed a relationship of trust with them, so they could help narrow and filter and interpret much more quickly

                    - scientists at the interdisciplinary research center sometimes imported information across disciplinary boundaries via **intermediaries** (often graduate students playing this role) (pp. 47-50)

                        - example: sending a student on an applied computationa project to work as an "emissary" in the privactoe sector

[[QUE - What are the most efficient routes to useful cross-boundary knowledge]]

- In describing how scientists at an interdisciplinary center imported information from outside their specialty, [[@palmerWorkBoundariesScience2001]] identified a range of practices, from talking to personal contacts, reading literature, and engaging in more formal learning activities. A strong theme was the special efficiency and effectiveness of talking to people to access and filter cross-boundary information with maximal signal-to-noise ratio.

    - For example, Palmer writes, "no other type of information interaction is likely to be [as] efficient and profitable [as interactive discussions with colleagues]" (p. 33-34)

    - She also summarized that scientists at the interdisciplinary research center imported information across disciplinary boundaries predominantly via **personal networks** (pp. 31, 32-35). For example, ((YRq-AQNqf))
[[QUE - How does analogy actually happen in the process of scholarlyscientific innovation]]

- people acting as powerful personalized filters, not just portals to different worlds, was a strong theme in [[@palmerWorkBoundariesScience2001]]

    - Neil Nash (a Bioenergetics specialist, one of the generalists) [talked about](((HqjxT28Ew))) how informal communication was especially helpful because their sources knew them and they had developed a relationship of trust with them, so they could help narrow and filter and interpret much more quickly

    - A Vision Specialist interviewed by Palmer also reported that recommendations from informal contacts [tended to have](part of the value also of talking with someone was knowing what to look for when consulting a new reference (in a sentence, what is there)) [high signal to noise ratios](((xT1gpt5me)))

- Again, canonical ref for me is [[@palmerWorkBoundariesScience2001]]. These quotes are especially important:

    - Neil Nash (a Bioenergetics specialist, one of the generalists) [talked about](((HqjxT28Ew))) how informal communication was especially helpful because their sources knew them and they had developed a relationship of trust with them, so they could help narrow and filter and interpret much more quickly

    - Neil Nash (a Bioenergetics specialist, one of the generalists) [echoed](((y6joBAaq2))) the [theme](((zjBRkv1vJ))) of informal communication being critical because they can help him quickly

    - The Vision Specialist [said](((EMco58rHR))) talking to another expert was like "honing" two interactive databases to efficiently converge on the right person/reference

- driving question for [[@palmerWorkBoundariesScience2001]]:

    - [[[[QUE]] - How does analogy actually happen in the process of scholarly/scientific innovation?]]

        - Palmer identified 6 broad categories of practices that enable scientists to "import" information across disciplinary boundaries

            1. scientists import information across disciplinary boundaries via engagment with **conferences**

            1. scientists import information across disciplinary boundaries from the published and unpublished **literature**

            1. scientists import information across disciplinary boundaries via participating in more or less formal **learning activities/experiences**

                1. journal clubs

                1. workshops

                1. seminars

                1. lectures

            1. scientists import information across disciplinary boundaries via engaging in learning activities/experiences in the role of a **teacher**

                - formal

                - informal / one-time

    - relative importance of informal vs. formal channels of import?
