- Title:: The Role of Specificity and Abstraction in Creative Idea Generation
- Author(s):: [[T. B. Ward]], [[Merryl J. Patterson]], [[Cynthia M. Sifonis]]
- Abstract:: Three experiments examined the relationship between approaches to a creative generation task and the novelty of the resulting products. Participants were given the task of imagining life on other planets and they received instructions intended to encourage them to formulate the task in either very specific ways (e.g., thinking of specific Earth animals) or more abstract ways (e.g., thinking of environmental conditions and general survival needs). The latter instructions led to more novel creations. The results are discussed in terms of the malleability of people's approaches to creative generation, the role of problem formulation and the link between abstraction and novelty.

        - __Record down major methods details we might need later to make sense of results, particularly as they might conflict with others. If you like, you can collapse this into __

        - We care here about experiment 2:

            - Participants: 284 psych subject pool participants

            - Procedure: draw alien creatures

            - Design: 1) exemplar condition (think of specific exemplars of earth creatures, and design based on that) vs. 2) abstract principles (think of higher order principles associated with survival of life forms) vs. 3) control (no special instructions). Abstract principles condition were given information about survival goals (sensing, nutrition, protection from danger, and reproduction)

            - Coding of drawings, achieved ~90% agreement between coders

    - # Results of interest

        - __One block for each result of interest. Make sure to refactor any evidence into EVD notes__

            - A little obvious that if you ask people to think of general principles rather than specific exemplars, you'll have more distance in features in your ideas from the exemplar. But there it is.

    - # Discussion/implications

        - __Riff/Celebrate/Complain about stuff here in terms of what the results might mean for our question. Create source CLM notes for author conclusions (if you like), or reference other CLMs that we have that engage with this.__
