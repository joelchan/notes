        - Abstract

            - Products achieve success through a combination of sound technical design and imaginative industrial design. The amalgam creates product character ‚Äî the way material and processes are used to provide functionality, usability, and satisfaction in ownership. This last ‚Äî satisfaction ‚Äî is greatly influenced by the aesthetics, associations, and perceptions that the product carries, a combination that we shall refer to as product personality. The overall character of the product is a synthesis of its functionality, usability, and its personality. In this article we explore product personality and character, illustrating the ideas by analyzing a number of products, noting particularly how the choice of material and process has contributed.

            - metal carries associations of "engineering", polish, and trust because of its machined and smooth/polished look, and how it sounds when struck
