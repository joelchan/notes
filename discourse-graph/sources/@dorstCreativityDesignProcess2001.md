[[CLM - Design proceeds by co-evolution of problem and solution space]]

- this is a big idea that started fairly early in design cognition research, probably around the early 2000's; #canonical paper is [[@dorstCreativityDesignProcess2001]]

    - another important person is [[Mary Lou Maher]] (e.g., [[@maherCoevolutionComputationalCognitive2003]]), with some connections to [[m/Computational Model]]s of design exploration in terms of [[genetic algorithms]], although with no specific claim that this is how humans do it [[@maherFormalisingDesignExploration1996]])

    - [[@crossExpertiseDesignOverview2004]] also reviews a fair number of studies that provide more empirical demonstrations of this, including [[@goelStructureDesignProblem1992]] who found that the designers they studied returned to problem formulation activities throughout the design process, not just in the beginning of the process

    - here is what they observed in the study:

        - and also Helms et al's observation of how [[[[EVD]] - Engineering design students used multiple cross-domain analogies to fulfill design needs, and they could use analogies to get inspiration of how to decompose the problem and find new analogies. - [[@helmsCompoundAnalogicalDesign2008]]]]

        - the partial structuring is quite reminiscent of what was observed by Okada et al with artists': [[[[EVD]] - Two artists used individual artworks to shape not just their ideas, but used a process of "analogical modification" to search for and modify higher-order concepts, and their creative vision. This process unfolded over the course of years. - [[@okadaAnalogicalModificationCreation2009]]]]

- Digging back into this was also substantively useful, for resurfacing the idea of "expertise mediation" as another spin on the [attribute problem]([[[[CLM]] - Core attribute (mis)matches mediate the benefits of analogies in real-world, complex problem solving]]): if I show you something from a far domain, and your understanding of that domain is shallow, it's not going to be very useful to you, probably even if it's quite thoroughly explained - what needs to happen is a fruitful iteration or co-evolution (a la [[@dorstCreativityDesignProcess2001]] and [[@helmsCompoundAnalogicalDesign2008]]) between your problem space and the other problem space

    - See these excerpts from the dissertation discussion on this point

    - A subtle variation of a "find collaborators" model might be a variation on Julie Hui's [[sys/IntroAssist]] [[@huiIntroAssistToolSupport2018]]

        - Where might we test something like this? In ConservationX????

        - What would we need to get started?

            - Would be easiest with academic work, can leverage citation network.

            - Just specify papers you've written, or ones you know really well, and those define your "network position"

            - Then whenever we find analogical matches that overlap with your network position, we suggest an intro between you and the seeker
