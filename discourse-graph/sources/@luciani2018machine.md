        - This paper describes an approach for representing design ideas that can help designers work with machine learning as a design material [[material knowledge]]

        - They present a "curated collection" of four exemplars (and accompanying design ideas). I'm not sure I understand all of them.

        - One possible thing to zettel is a claim that

            - machine learning is a special kind of design material because it is "unpredictable, emergent, and 'alive'" (p. 3)

                - There is no #evidence offered for this claim though. But might be an idea to follow-up on. It reminds of why there is such a strong focus on [[explainable AI]]

                    - See, e.g., [[Chris Olah]]

        - Some of the design ideas can be read as strategies for helping designers gain [[material knowledge]]

            - The most useful one I think is trying to provide a near real-time interaction loop to enable better understanding and training of the automation (p. 6) [[üìù lit-notes]]

            - If real-time interaction is not possible, some way of leaving traces that can be reasoned about may also be powerful (p. 7). [[üìù lit-notes]]

                - This reminds me of the work on [[analytic provenance]]

            - Generally, these discussions make me think of [[Bret Victor]]

                - In general, I think the idea of [[direct manipulation]]

                - Also think that if there is a thread of work on [[dynamic media]]

                    - One possible opportunity for advancing the conversation: thinking about how users can (or if they can / should) acquire designerly [[material knowledge]]
