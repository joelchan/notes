        - This paper describes an approach for representing design ideas that can help designers work with machine learning as a design material #[[material knowledge]]

        - They present a "curated collection" of four exemplars (and accompanying design ideas). I'm not sure I understand all of them.

        - One possible thing to zettel is a claim that

            - machine learning is a special kind of design material because it is "unpredictable, emergent, and 'alive'" (p. 3)

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FJ-0vGmhEN4?alt=media&token=3321e436-731a-42f8-b149-1ca5aceb6fff)

                - There is no #evidence offered for this claim though. But might be an idea to follow-up on. It reminds of why there is such a strong focus on [[explainable AI]] these days; there is a sense that their complexity AND opaqueness make them hard to work with when designing actual solutions for people.

                    - See, e.g., [[Chris Olah]] and others' paper in [[sys/distill.pub]] on the building blocks of interpretability [[@olahBuildingBlocksInterpretability2018]]

        - Some of the design ideas can be read as strategies for helping designers gain [[material knowledge]] of ML as a design material (although the focus of the ideas is on empowering users in conversation with ML in a system they are users of)

            - The most useful one I think is trying to provide a near real-time interaction loop to enable better understanding and training of the automation (p. 6) #[[üìù lit-notes]]

            - If real-time interaction is not possible, some way of leaving traces that can be reasoned about may also be powerful (p. 7). #[[üìù lit-notes]]

                - This reminds me of the work on [[analytic [[provenance]]]] in visual / intelligence analytics

            - Generally, these discussions make me think of [[Bret Victor]]'s work on [[dynamic media]] and [[DynamicLand]] (see, e.g., [[@victorHumaneRepresentationThought2014]])

                - In general, I think the idea of [[direct manipulation]] seems like a central principle

                - Also think that if there is a thread of work on [[dynamic media]] and [[material knowledge]], that would be a good place to start from in terms of SOTA for thinking about [[material knowledge]] of AI/ML for [[D/Democratizing Design]]

                    - One possible opportunity for advancing the conversation: thinking about how users can (or if they can / should) acquire designerly [[material knowledge]] of ML for the systems they are co-designing

    - entry-point reading, actually bit confusing
[[February 5th, 2020]]

- Reading [[@luciani2018machine]] for discussing [[material knowledge]] with [[Wei-Wei Chi]] for [[D/Democratizing Design]]

    - Struck by parallels to work on [[analytic [[provenance]]]], [[explainable AI]], and [[Bret Victor]]'s work on [[dynamic media]]

    - One striking claim is that, to some extent, machine learning as a design material is hard to work with because it is in some sense a complex autonomous agent. Not too different from a human!

        - Which means that studying how to work with Machine Learning and AI as a design material can help us bridge to working with humans as a design material, in the sense that **[[policy design]] can be seen as the act of designing with humans as a design material**

        - Corollary to this: we can glean insights from other domains that rely on working with "complex autonomous" agents, if they've found good workarounds or heuristics

            - Examples might be community organizing, city planning, etc.

        - More generally, explainable/interpetable mechanisms as means of contorl might be fundamentally out of reach, if [[@hassonDirectFitNature2020]] are right about the fact that the class of "direct-fit" functions that include both biological (e.g., human) and artificial neural networks are fundamentally irreducible to simple, human-interpretable rules, because that's just not how they work.

        - machine learning is a special kind of design material because it is "unpredictable, emergent, and 'alive'" (p. 3)

    - One #idea might be to build on [[@haugAcquiringMaterialsKnowledge2019]] to create a mapping of senso-aesthetic properties of machine learning as a design material to start the conversation about [[material knowledge]] of AI/ML as a design material for [[P/Material Knowledge of ML for Design]]

        - Could submit this to [[FAccT]] conference?

            - Deadline is mid-to-late August, and conference is in late January, in Toronto next year

            - But could be good for [[conf/CHI]] as well, or other conferences like [[conf/DIS]]
