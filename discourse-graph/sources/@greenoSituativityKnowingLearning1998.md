- Title:: The situativity of knowing, learning, and research
- Author(s):: [[J. G. Greeno]], [[Middle-School Mathematics through Applications Project Group]]
- Abstract:: The situative perspective shifts the focus of analysis from individual behavior and cognition to larger systems that include behaving cognitive agents interacting with each other and with other subsystems in the environment. The first section presents a version of the situative perspective that draws on studies of social interaction, philosophical situation theory, and ecological psychology. Framing as- sumptions and concepts are proposed for a synthesis of the situative and cognitive theoretical perspectives, and a further situative synthesis is suggested that would draw on dynamic-systems theory. The second section discusses relations between the situative, cognitive, and behaviorist theoretical perspectives and principles of educational practice. The third section discusses an approach to re- search and social practice called interactive research and design, which fits with the situative perspective and pro- vides a productive, albeit syncretic, combination of the- ory-oriented and instrumental functions of research.

- These empirical and design insights have grounding in the idea that cognition is embodied, situated, and distributed [[@clarkSupersizingMindEmbodiment2010]], [[@klemmerHowBodiesMatter2006]], [[@hollanDistributedCognitionNew2000]], [[@greenoSituativityKnowingLearning1998]]: cognitive processes are not just "influenced by" tools and environments and embodied states; they are also "implemented" in a distributed "hardware", of which the brain is but one component alongside other materials such as other people, tools, and the structure of one's environment.
