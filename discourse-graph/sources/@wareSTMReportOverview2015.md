- [[@wareSTMReportOverview2015]] estimates that faculty self-report reading about 200 articles per year

    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FUdaOi11PZP.png?alt=media&token=e3395e22-ddb4-488b-bef0-885ac17c6b6b) (p. 53)

    - so this works out to {{[[calc]]: 700000*200}} (~140M) articles per year!

    - this is an INSANE amount of labor, and does not include estimates from students (undergraduate and graduate), as well as part-time faculty or postdocs, [[independent researchers]], and so on...

    - all of this labor benefits primarily a single person, with some spillover benefits to the community through sharing of learnings... but not in "raw" form. often, people who hear about a finding, if they really want ot use it, have to re-extract it

        - sort of like... every software engineer writing code from scratch, with basically no reusable modules. INSANITY!

    - another way to look at this: [[@wareSTMReportOverview2015]] also reports that respondents self-report spending ~10 hrs/week reading papers. this seems high, compared ot my personal experience. so let's say conservatively 5 hrs/week. we're then talking about {{[[calc]]: 5*52*700000}} (182 MILLION) hours per year spent reading, collectively

    - NOTE! [Estimates](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+many+papers+published+per+year&oq=how+many+papers+published+per+year&aqs=chrome.0.0j0i22i30j69i64l2.3117j1j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) vary, but we're looking at order of magnitude maybe ~60M research papers total that have ever been published, with [about ~2M](http://blog.cdnsciencepub.com/21st-century-science-overload/#:~:text=According%20to%20research%20from%20the,papers%20are%20published%20each%20year.) [more added per year](https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20180905095203579)

        - the shoe fits!

        - and certainly not all of these papers need to be processed! retractions, junk science, predatory journals, etc.

        - say this another way: if we succeed at solving the [authoring bottleneck for semantic publishing]([[[[CLM]] - The central bottleneck to synthesis infrastructures is authoring]]), we could wipe out information overload in less than a year!
