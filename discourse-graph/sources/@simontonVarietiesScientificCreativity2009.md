        - Abstract

            - Prior research supports the inference that scientific disciplines can be ordered into a hierarchy ranging from the hard natural sciences to the soft social sciences. This ordering corresponds with such ob- jective criteria as disciplinary consensus, knowledge ob- solescence rate, anticipation frequency, theories-to-laws ratio, lecture disfluency, and age at recognition. It is then argued that this hierarchy can be extrapolated to encom- pass the humanities and arts and interpolated within specific domains to accommodate contrasts in subdomains (e.g., revolutionary versus normal science). This ex- panded and more finely differentiated hierarchy is then shown to have a partial psychological basis in terms of dispositional traits (e.g., psychopathology) and develop- mental experiences (e.g., family background). This dem- onstration then leads to three hypotheses about how a creators domain-specific impact depends on his or her disposition and development: the domain-progressive, domain-typical, and domain-regressive creator hypothe- ses. Studies published thus far lend the most support to the domain-regressive creator hypothesis. In particular, ma- jor contributors to a domain are more likely to have dis- positional traits and developmental experiences most similar to those that prevail in a domain lower in the dis- ciplinary hierarchy. However, some complications to this generalization suggest the need for more research on the proposed hierarchical model.

            - Reminds me of Domains can be more or less characterized by [[Scatter]] [(@moteReasonsVariationInformation1962)]([[@moteReasonsVariationInformation1962]]). Low scatter domain = underlying principles well-developed (paradigmatic??), lit well organized, width of subject area relatively small and clearly defined. High scatter domain is.. the opposite. :) and ((f-9ssgOF7))

            - And also the argument in [[@furnerInformationScienceNeither2015]]

                - #Claim information science isn't a science because it doesn't have an agreed upon definition of the object of study (it's more about hte processes around information, not information itself)

- More in [[@simontonVarietiesScientificCreativity2009]]: he uses it to order sciences in a hierarchy, which is a bit sus, but the features of variation might be instructive for us
