- Title:: Far-Out Thinking: Generating Solutions to Distant Analogies Promotes Relational Thinking
- Author(s):: [[Michael S. Vendetti]], [[Aaron Wu]], [[Keith J. Holyoak]]
- Abstract:: Is it possible to induce a mind-set that will affect relational thinking in a subsequent reasoning task involving unrel materials? We investigated whether evaluating the validity of verbal analogies (Experiment la) or generating s for them (Experiment lb) could induce a relational mind-set that would transfer to an unrelated picture-m task. The verbal analogies were based on either near or far semantic relations. We found that generating (b evaluating) solutions for semantically distant analogies increased the proportion of relational mappings on the task, even after we controlled for fluid intelligence and response time. Solving near analogies did not produce transf Generation of solutions to far analogies appears to provide a potent method for triggering a mind-set that can relational thinking in a different task.

    - [[Evd]]

    - Two experiments 1a and 1b conducted and were identical. Participants solved four-term verbal analogy problems. Half of the participants received near analogies and half received far analogies and then were asked to complete a picture mapping task

                - ### summary

                    - Once the relational mindset is triggered by generating solutions for far analogies, the fluid intelligence test did not predict relational responding in the picture-mapping task.

                    - In my opinion, this shows that, although intelligence indicates the susceptibility of a person to achieve the relational mindset for creative thinking, once such a state of mind is reached, it becomes hard to evaluate.

                        - This means that, if the results are better than predicted, the users might have had the necessary prior knowledge to map the results of retrieval.
