    - Describes the fact that [[[[CL]] - Common sense concepts are fundamentally fuzzy]], and therefore we have the issue that [[[[CL]] - Symbolic knowledge bases are brittle]]

- New approach of using [[Embeddings]] (basically do [[fine-tuning]] with a [[Knowledge Base]] on pre-trained [[sys/GPT-2]])  ([[@bosselutCOMETCommonsenseTransformers2019]], described in [[@pavlusCommonSenseComes2020]])

    - The resulting model can predict "inferences" that are like [[common sense]], given some seed sentence

        - Example: ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2Fk5bx88KA--?alt=media&token=e0f891de-22e6-488c-943d-3efc3ccd9c0a)

        - Reminds me of the stuff that [[Andrew McCallum]] does with his [[Knowledge Base]] stuff, using [[Embeddings]] to overcome the fact that [[[[CL]] - Symbolic knowledge bases are brittle]]
