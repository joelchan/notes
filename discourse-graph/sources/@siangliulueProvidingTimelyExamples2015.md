###### Discourse Context

- **Informs::** [[CLM - Inspiration favors the prepared mind]]
- **Informs::** [[QUE - What factors control whether people appropriately benefit from analogies (especially far-field ones) during creative problem solving]]
- **Informs::** [[QUE - Under what conditions do diverse initial examples lead to better final design solutions]]

- This reminds me of the timing stuff: [[@tsengRoleTimingAnalogical2008]], and [[@siangliulueProvidingTimelyExamples2015]], among others:

    - Under what starting conditions would people even be motivated to try to process analogies?

        - That's the first ingredient, I think

        - If this isn't present, then it's possible no amount of design of the matching or interaction will really help

    - in [[@laneEngineeringSerendipityWhen]], the motivator is applying for grants

    - keep this motivation in mind
