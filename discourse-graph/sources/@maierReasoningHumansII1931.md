        - Abstract

            - 61 subjects were given the task of solving a problem having four possible solutions. "Two cords were hung from the ceiling, and were of such length that they reached the floor. One hung near a wall, the other from the center of the room. The subject was told, 'Your problem is to tie the ends of these two strings together.' He soon learned that if he held either cord in his hand he could not reach the other. He was then told that he could use or do anything he wished." A number of objects which might help in the solution of the problem were present in the room. After each solution had been mastered the subject was told to solve the problem in still another way until all of the solutions had been learned. The trials were timed and introspective reports concerning the means of solution were recorded. A number of hints were given from time to time when the subject failed to reach a solution. The author's conclusions are to the effect that "The perception of the solution of a problem is like the perceiving of a hidden figure in a puzzle-picture. In both cases (a) the perception is sudden; (b) there is no conscious intermediate stage; and (c) the relationships of the elements in the final perceptions are different from those which preceded, i.e., changes in meaning are involved." The author feels that trial and error or association by similarity cannot explain his results. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

- they make a key connection back to [[@maierReasoningHumansII1931]]'s two-string problem, and how the accidental brushing of the string by an experimenter could trigger the requisite reformulation of the problem. i think it's an example in the sense of being a concrete (albeit) partial instantiation of a move

    - this now reminds me of the theory of [[[[THE]] - Opportunistic Assimilation Theory]], though i will have to dig into this a bit more deeply.
