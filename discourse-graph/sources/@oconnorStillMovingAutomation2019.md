        - Three main conclusions from the review/meeting:

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FBAQJNZaXaf.png?alt=media&token=148f72a6-431d-48cc-b2a2-fb7b0e4e5b93)

            - Lots of tools for computer-assisted [[systematic review]]s! And growing

                - Data extraction is a major focus (and rightly so!)

                    - cf. #[[[[CLM]] - Effective synthesis is hard]], #[[@knightEnslavedTrappedData2019]]

            - Integration with workflows is an open issue. #interoperability

                - cf. #[[[[QUE]] - What is the user experience of semantic authoring within regular scholarly workflows?]]

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2Fiq19zaTPqO.png?alt=media&token=7db9c5d9-04b5-4129-9fa7-623c8f4fdd1c)

                - conceptually similar to the findings in our [[WP: ASIST Intermediate products of synthesis]] ([[@qianOpeningBlackBox2020]]) regarding fragmentation in the ecology of tools, wiht distinct "stages" of processing

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FXAawCSspSm.png?alt=media&token=92883c86-b58a-460a-a7ff-9f55a8ca3a76)

            - COnditinos for [[diffusion of innovation]] are not present

                - For example, still unclear how much specialized software for [[systematic review]]s actually help, since systematic evaluation is hard to come by

                    - cf. #[[[[QUE]] - Do scholarly synthesis infrastructures already exist?]] and #[[[[CLM]] - Effective individual synthesis systems (seem to mostly) exist (for a select few)]]
