- Participants

    - 119 high school students took place in the study (70 male and 49 female). Students were divided into 6 classrooms with three teachers. Each teacher had a control group and an experimental group.

- Method

    - Researchers developed a concept map which would aid in the teaching of physics to students, by coming up with target analogies and anchor for the lessons they were to be teaching.

    - Students were given the MMT pre-test to assess baseline knowledge before the classroom instruction began

    - The control group was taught by traditional methods, by a teacher at a blackboard. and given the test(assuming they were given the test three weeks after again, but didn't see for sure).

    - The experimental group were taught in group discussions where the teachers would ask how an anchor and a target were related. If less than 80% of the students were able to make the connection a bridging analogy was given to aid in understanding how the anchor and target related. They were given a test after three weeks of learning this way.

            - Not sure what this means or how relevant it is to understanding bridging analogies?
