- Although there is extensive history in IS and beyond, plus some applications from models of sensemaking to shape the design of tools for the umbrella term of "literature reviewing", no investigation specifically of models of the **synthesis** process specifically. [Earlier we differentiate literature reviewing and sensemaking, emphasize here again; what is the task of literature reviewing, and what is the task of the synthesis, e.g. Most existing work that has models for sensemaking are leaning towards information seeking, the internal process, instead of synthesis, the externalization process.] #Claim [[üß± sensemaking]] involves creating and manipulating a representation from "raw" data that makes some downstream task easier (p., 2). Different tasks have different useful representations (cf. [[@faisalClassificationSensemakingRepresentations2009]]). So the task matters!

            - Different from this work, we focus on a smaller granular, sensemaking/synthesis object, which is a **topic**. Our sensemaking activity also has a concrete goal of **finishing an actual synthesis** (tangible paper forms, digital copies, instead of something that resides in scholar's mind). The time and effort, although is more than a single-time information seeking, but is also shorter than sensemaking a literature domain.

            - It proposes a model/theory for sensemaking a **literature domain**. This tool assists users in extracting and interpreting interesting patterns that are going on across a particular discipline over a period of time. The paper did mention a vague sensemaking goal of "learning and knowledge gain of the domain". The author also admits that achieving this goal is a slow and in some cases unintentional process.

        - [[@pontisUnderstandingInfluenceEmpirical2016]] looks at academics, but the task is for a task that is upstream of synthesis (getting a mental model of hte field, not necessarily synthesizing a problem-driven understanding of a topic)

        - The closest in terms of task is [[sys/Action Science Explorer]] (focus on [[@dunneRapidUnderstandingScientific2012]], which was published in [[JASIST]] as well) Focuses on visual analytics as a way to support the sensemaking process, to move beyond basic familiarity to identifying deeper insights like controversies and hypotheses, and major breakthroughs and remaining problems - however, it was a systems-building effort, not focused on a detailed descriptive model/understanding, and it is light in terms of building on theory (in fact, no mention of [[üß± sensemaking]] at all!)

        - More to add from [this thread](For [[WP: Synthesis empirical paper]] (and [[D/Synthesis Infrastructure]]))

    - Other (many abt info-seeking / [[üß± foraging]])

        - [[R: Sensemaker]] and [[R: SketchTrieve]] apply the sensemaking model from [[@russellCostStructureSensemaking1993]] to build tools **that support literature foraging (information seeking), specifically support users to construct a representation.** Different from synthesis, literature foraging is one of the few initial steps for literature review.

            - [[R: baldonadoSenseMakerInformationexplorationInterface1997]] support users to construct a representation for the current information context and user interest, **whose end goal is discovering new information**. The new information is not necessarily gap-identifying, creative and academic. It could be everyday information, vocational, for personal growth, e.g. developing an IS  in Java language. User actions are limited to manipulating a document collection, instead of creating something new from it.

            - Develops a model for information behaviors in journalists (p107). In the model, the category of **information reviewing**, especially **reviewing for omission (category 3.3.3)** is most similar to our notion of synthesis (similar to the artifact of a journal assignment), but still different. In our notion of synthesis, the actual action of writing an assignment is included too.

            - This paper is not much relevant, it focuses on information seeking.

                - But its model comprises of two dimensions: (A) IS (information seeking) behaviors pertaining to long-term research needs or corresponding to project lifecycle; (B) IICTs (Internet-enabled information & communication technologies/resources) providing information or supporting communication (email, web, listserv, etc.)

                    - may be relevant in the future
