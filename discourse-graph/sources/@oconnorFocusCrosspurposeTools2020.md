        - Abstract

            - The fourth meeting of the International Collaboration for Automation of [[systematic review]]s (ICASR) was held 5–6 November 2019 in The Hague, the Netherlands. ICASR is an interdisciplinary group whose goal is to maximize the use of technology for conducting rapid, accurate, and efficient [[systematic review]]s of scientific evidence. The group seeks to facilitate the development and acceptance of automated techniques for [[systematic review]]s. In 2018, the major themes discussed were the transferability of automation tools (i.e., tools developed for other purposes that might be used by [[systematic review]]ers), the automated recognition of study design in multiple disciplines and applications, and approaches for the evaluation of automation tools.
