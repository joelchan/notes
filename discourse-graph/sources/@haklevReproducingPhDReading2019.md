        - Abstract

            - 7 years ago I uploaded a video showing off a very hacky but cool way of dealing with the whole workflow from annotating and extracting notes, taking high level notes on individual papers, extracting most important notes from many papers, and then reorganizing them using tags. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OevO...
- In this video, I look at how incredibly easy it is to reproduce this workflow (and go beyond) using Roam Research.
