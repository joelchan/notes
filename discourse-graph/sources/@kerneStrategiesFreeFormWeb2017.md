- Abstract:: We synthesize principles across art, design, writing, and psychology to articulate strategies of free-form web curation, for stimulating students' creative engagement with prior work, in performance of ideation tasks. We manifest the strategies in an interactive system and pedagogy. Free-form web curation is a form of new media--designed to enable users to conceptualize and create new contexts--in which they discover, interpret, and represent relationships, by composing readymade and self-made content elements. The strategies are Collect, Assemble, Shift Perspective, Sketch, Write, and Exhibit. We conducted a field study involving 1247 students over 4 semesters. We connect visual, quantitative, and experiential data to show how students engage with prior work through the free-form web curation strategies, system, and pedagogy. We develop implications for design of web curation systems and education. We coalesce a theory of free-form web curation, based on the strategies, emphasizing the roles of space and context.

- I'm thinking about the role of **curation**. See maybe [[@kerneStrategiesFreeFormWeb2017]], although... I don't love the distance between the students and design experts. But worth a look.

    - I think the part of this that is catching my interest is the distinction between classification/categorization and curation (where the latter is much more goal-oriented, particularly in the individual case). I expect to see "categories" and groupings and connections that are much more oriented to and aligned with idiosyncratic parts of the evolving model of the problem/solution space.

    - In curation interfaces, the distance between examples and model of the space approaches zero, similar to ours.

    - We might expect greater flexibility in problem formulations, then, for people who are able to curate examples in a much closer fashion.
