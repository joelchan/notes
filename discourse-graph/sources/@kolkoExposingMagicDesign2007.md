- Effective problem formulation is one of the most important aspects of the creative tasks ([[@goelStructureDesignProblem1992]]) such as design ([[@dorstFrameInnovationCreate2015]], [[@kolkoExposingMagicDesign2007]], [[@patonBriefingAndReframing2011]], [[@macneilFramingCreativeWork2021]]).

    - Q: What's the difference between creative knowledge work and creative tasks? Is creative knowledge work particularly for research? Is design one kind of knowledge work?

        - ^^[[From: [[Joel Chan]]]]: [[@[[Jason Ding]]]] yeah, design is one kind of creative knowledge work. I like to add the term "knowledge" to emphasize the conceptual aspect, rather than the artifact itself as the output; e.g., in design, I care less that you made a thing that works really well, and more that you've created a new understanding of how to approach or solve a particular problem, that others can build on. It's possible to make a thing that works really well by simple trial and error or brute force search, and have no idea how it works.^^
