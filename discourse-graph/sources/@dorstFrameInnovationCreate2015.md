        - Abstract

            - How organizations can use practices developed by expert designers to solve today's open, complex, dynamic, and networked problems. When organizations apply old methods of problem-solving to new kinds of problems, they may accomplish only temporary fixes or some ineffectual tinkering around the edges. Today's problems are a new breed‚Äîopen, complex, dynamic, and networked‚Äîand require a radically different response. In this book, Kees Dorst describes a new, innovation-centered approach to problem-solving in organizations: frame creation. It applies ‚Äúdesign thinking,‚Äù but it goes beyond the borrowed tricks and techniques that usually characterize that term. Frame creation focuses not on the generation of solutions but on the ability to create new approaches to the problem situation itself.The strategies Dorst presents are drawn from the unique, sophisticated, multilayered practices of top designers, and from insights that have emerged from fifty years of design research. Dorst describes the nine steps of the frame creation process and illustrates their application to real-world problems with a series of varied case studies. He maps innovative solutions that include rethinking a store layout so retail spaces encourage purchasing rather than stealing, applying the frame of a music festival to understand late-night problems of crime and congestion in a club district, and creative ways to attract young employees to a temporary staffing agency. Dorst provides tools and methods for implementing frame creation, offering not so much a how-to manual as a do-it-yourself handbook‚Äîa guide that will help practitioners develop their own approaches to problem-solving and creating innovation.

        - Designers used an [[analogy]]

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FqVXDfYkdwY.png?alt=media&token=d3ac4453-7581-4dc8-82ce-88ea330a1f0b)

            - This analogy results in a questioning of key assumptions (or is it *enabled* by it??), such as the assumption that the people are predisposed to crime (no, they are on a path to crime that runs through frustration and boredom)

                - Not sure how this is necessarily about attributes, although I guess it is! We're mapping from one set of people (young people outside at Kings Cross) to another set of people (people at a music festival), and I could see someone say "that analogy doesn't apply: these are very different people!", not too different from Bex's student rejecting an analogy because it is a different substance that reacts to shear stresses differently. Which is rational if you're evaluating whether the analogy is likely to yield a **directly applicable** / transferable solution. But potentially misguided if there is some progress to be made from [[generative misalignment]]
