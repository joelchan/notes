        - Abstract

            - The work that helped to determine Paul Feyerabend’s fame and notoriety, Against Method, stemmed from Imre Lakatos’s challenge: "In 1970 Imre cornered me at a party. ’Paul,’ he said, ’you have such strange ideas. Why don’t you write them down? I shall write a reply, we publish the whole thing and I promise you—we shall have a lot of fun.’ " Although Lakatos died before he could write his reply, For and Against Method reconstructs his original counter-arguments from lectures and correspondence previously unpublished in English, allowing us to enjoy the "fun" two of this century’s most eminent philosophers had, matching their wits and ideas on the subject of the scientific method.For and Against Method opens with an imaginary dialogue between Lakatos and Feyerabend, which Matteo Motterlini has constructed, based on their published works, to synthesize their positions and arguments. Part one presents the transcripts of the last lectures on method that Lakatos delivered. Part two, Feyerabend’s response, consists of a previously published essay on anarchism, which began the attack on Lakatos’s position that Feyerabend later continued in Against Method. The third and longest section consists of the correspondence Lakatos and Feyerabend exchanged on method and many other issues and ideas, as well as the events of their daily lives, between 1968 and Lakatos’s death in 1974.The delight Lakatos and Feyerabend took in philosophical debate, and the relish with which they sparred, come to life again in For and Against Method, making it essential and lively reading for anyone interested in these two fascinating and controversial thinkers and their immense contributions to philosophy of science."The writings in this volume are of considerable intellectual importance, and will be of great interest to anyone concerned with the development of the philosophical views of Lakatos and Feyerabend, or indeed with the development of philosophy of science in general during this crucial period."—Donald Gillies, British Journal for the Philosophy of Science (on the Italian edition)"A stimulating exchange of letters between two philosophical entertainers."—Tariq Ali, The IndependentImre Lakatos (1922-1974) was professor of logic at the London School of Economics. He was the author of Proofs and Refutations and the two-volume Philosophical Papers. Paul Feyerabend (1924-1994) was educated in Europe and held numerous teaching posts throughout his career. Among his books are Against Method; Science in a Free Society; Farewell to Reason; and Killing Time: The Autobiography of Paul Feyerabend, the last published by the University of Chicago Press.

- Thinking again about [[[[QUE]] - (How) do fields of innovation vary in their legibility of quality?]] while reading [[@lakatosMethod1999]]

    - This idea of whether it's possible to cleanly predict/judge the quality of an idea without a long time horizon of seeing it in action, seems very closely related to [[Dean Simonton]]'s idea of blindness

    - [[Imre Lakatos]]'s idea of research programmes as the unit of analysis - being able to somehow judge in a stable way (after a certain point) whether a programme is progressive or degenerative

        - and the general [[demarcation problem]] is a version of our legibility question: how to judge science from pseudoscience (i.e., looks like science, but isn't as good as "the real thing") is sort of asking how to distinguish "good" theories (science) from "worthless" theories (pseudoscience)

            - i am very skeptical that there is a general solution to this (see, for example [this proof by van Rooij]([[[[EVD]] - assuming that there is a polynomial-time procedure for choosing solutions for an intractable function implies that P=NP - [[@vanrooijIntractabilityUseHeuristics2012]]]]), and [this claim]([[[[CLM]] - intractable problems cannot be solved by a fixed number of parallel procedures - [[@vanrooijIntractabilityUseHeuristics2012]]]])), but curious about local solutions to this, per [[meta-rationality]]: are there relatively stable heuristics, and are there variations in stability/maturity across settings?

                - even if there aren't "rational" and useful general solutions to the demarcation problem

    - sleeping beauties - do they vary by field? if so, that might be a useful indicator
