    - Content

        - Abstract

            - Variations in the effective use of analogies in math instruction across countries may contribute to performance differences in the TIMSS studies

    - Key contributions

        - [[[[EVD]] - teachers in countries with high math and science achievement scores also displayed more cognitive supports for analogies, such as bridging analogies, and visuospatial scaffolds for comparison, compared to teachers in a country with lower math and science achievement - [[@richlandCognitiveSupportsAnalogies2007]]]]

###### Discourse Context

- **Informs::** [[QUE - What factors control whether people appropriately benefit from analogies (especially far-field ones) during creative problem solving]]
- **SourceFor::** [[EVD - teachers in countries with high math and science achievement scores also displayed more cogni... in a country with lower math and science achievement - @richlandCognitiveSupportsAnalogies2007]]
