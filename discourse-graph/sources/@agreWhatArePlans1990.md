        - Abstract

            - What plans are like depends on how they're used. We contrast two views of plan use. On the plan-as-program view, plan use is the execution of an effective procedure. On the plan-as-communication view, plan use is like following natural language instructions. We have begun work on computational models of plans-as-communications, building on our previous work on improvised activity and on ideas from sociology.
