- Title:: Atypical combinations are confounded by disciplinary effects
- Author(s):: [[Kevin Boyack]], [[Richard Klavans]]
- Abstract:: Uzzi et al. (2013) recently argued that the highest impact articles are likely to reference novel combinations of existing knowledge while still building upon typical combinations. In this study we replicate this intriguing finding using slightly different methods. We also show, however, that the findings are not free from disciplinary effects. For example, physics builds primarily on typical combinations, while multidisciplinary journals participate much more often in atypical combinations. We strongly suspect that atypical co-cited journal combinations, and thus citation rates, are highly dependent on discipline and journal effects.

    - basically says that some disciplinary confounding is going on: because they define citation percentiles OVERALL, as opposed to by discipline, their effect might be driven by disciplines with high citation rates (like biochem and physics)

    - upshot: [[@uzziAtypicalCombinationsScientific2013]]'s results are less strong, but remain qualitatively similar, when accounting for disciplinary confounding

    - implication: similar to [[[[EVD]] - higher levels of interdisciplinarity was significantly associated with fewer publications, particularly in fields with less interdisciplinarity - [[@leaheyProminentLessProductive2017]]]]: there are substantial field differences in the benefits/penalties of boundary spanning research
