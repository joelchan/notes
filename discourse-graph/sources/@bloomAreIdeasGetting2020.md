- Abstract:: Long-run growth in many models is the product of two terms: the effective number of researchers and their research productivity. We present evidence from various industries, products, and firms showing that research effort is rising substantially while research productivity is declining sharply. A good example is Moore’s Law. The number of researchers required today to achieve the famous doubling of computer chip density is more than 18 times larger than the number required in the early 1970s.

- Consider being more nuanced with the [[@bloomAreIdeasGetting2020]] ref, esp. if we are going to [[NSF SoS:DCI]] (more sophisticated econ environment)

    - null hypothesis of constant inputs mapped to exponential outputs might be too unrealistic of a hypothesis

                - The beacon of hope, as he notes, is to decouple exponentially increasing research inputs from the need for exponentially increasing legions of researchers. The analogy I like is to nitrogen-based fertilizers. Before [the Haber—Bosch process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber_process), nitrogen-based fertilizer (and thus crop output) was coupled to the supply of organic sources of nitrogen - especially bat guano. Supporting an exponentially growing population required an exponentially growing food supply and thus an exponentially growing supply of guano. [People literally fought wars and killed each other over bat poop.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chincha_Islands_War) Given everything that he knew, Malthus was absolutely right - the way everything was going, the world was going to run out of guano, and thus fertilizer, and thus food, resulting in mass starvation. The Haber—Bosch process pulled nitrogen out of the effectively infinite atmosphere, decoupling nitrogen from organic sources. We didn’t stop needing exponentially more nitrogen, it just no longer required exponentially more guano.

                - My point here is that, by the measures we have, there is no great technological stagnation (But this is compatible with a slowdown in economic growth). What we do have is stagnation in some sectors (Aircraft speed), improvements in others (Gene editing, photovoltaics), and worsening in a few (Cost per new drug approved). Furthermore, these trends don't seem to change radically in 1970, which is when the economic stagnation seemingly begins. What we have are a series of drivers -to be explored in later posts - that individually influence where these technologies go. Thus I think it is important to look at them individually rather than aggregate them as one would from an economic lens and say that everything is stagnating, because that's clearly not the case, even if we take software out of the equation.
