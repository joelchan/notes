- [[std/Micropublication]]s [[@clarkMicropublicationsSemanticModel2014]] seems like the right model with an explicit emphasis on grounding in "lower-level" evidence and grounding in [[Stephen E. Toulmin]]'s model of [[defeasible argumentation]] [[@toulminUsesArgument2003]] and [[@verheijEvaluatingArgumentsBased2005]]

    - but there isn't really a repo yet for them; [[std/Nanopublications]] have "repos", but they're mostly self-hosted I think?

    - plus [[Jodi Schneider]] and her students have been playing with it)
