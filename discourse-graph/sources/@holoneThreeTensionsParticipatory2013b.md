        - Abstract

            - One ideal of Participatory Design (PD) is active involvement by all stakeholders as co-designers. However, when PD is applied to real projects, certain compromises are unavoidable, no matter what stakeholders are involved. With this paper we want to shed light on some of the challenges in implementing "true" PD in the case of designing with children, in particular children with severe disabilities. We do this work to better understand challenges in an ongoing project, RHYME, and by doing so we hope to provide insight and inspiration for others.

    - context: RHYME project in norway, children with disabilities

    - what is musicking? any activity related to music performance

    - time vs. rapid prototyping

        - time is an underlying factor across remaining tensions

    - PD ideal of active vs. children's role as recipients

        - connections back to the thing about "I'm not a designer"? [[Sarah Dipasquale]]: in [[@ssozi-mugaruraSupportingCommunityNeeds2016]], saw similar theme of participants not knowing how much they really knew and could contribute

    - direct communication vs. proxies

    - [[Joel Chan]] wondering about connections around the time cost and ideal of active, with the idea of "should we even do PD"?

        - [[Salma Elsayed-Ali]] remembers [[Ana Ndumu]] talking about getting people to do

        - what's the opportunity costs?

        - intermediaries may be necessary, but impose their own costs

        - there seems to be something in here again about... **autonomy**?

        - more time needed

    - # discussion

        - adds to themes about [layers of interpretation]([[[[CLM]] - There is a tension between analyzing participants' direct inputs, and respecting their actual insights (vs. designers' interpretation) that is intensified when working with design partners who struggle to contribute more directly to design artifacts]]) and [extra stakeholders]([[[[CLM]] - Marginalized user populations may require involvement of extra stakeholders who may complicate hearing the users' voices]])
