        - Has had limited impact in terms of citations (N=15) as of [[February 27th, 2020]]. A real shame! :(

    - #[[üìù lit-notes]]

        - Key influences from before are Rittel's [[design issues]], Alexander's [[patterns]], and especially Carroll's [[standard/Claims]] (p. 3-4)

        - Examples

    - **imagery** allows for __quicker digestion and recognition__ of reusable ideas when compared to **plain text** and this is good because it expands the amount of options considered when designing #size/complexity #needs-attention

    - images can be '__read' quickly __which might support the __preparation and incubation stages of creativity __ #size/complexity

- [[I wonder]] what we can learn from really diving deep into the history of the various attempts to do this, from [[std/Micropublication]]s to [[std/Nanopublications]]s, to [[sys/IBIS]] and [[@mccrickardMakingClaimsKnowledge2012]] and [[Alexander's Patterns]] and so on (and more recently, [[sys/Polyplexus]]). The focus should be less on the design of the data structure itself, although that is important for inclusion/exclusion, but more on the "vitality" or coverage of the data structures: what is the uptake?

    - One place to start is [[@mccrickardMakingClaimsKnowledge2012]], which has a really in-depth history of this thread within [[HCI]]
