    - Connects very well with insights about the importance of [[tacit knowledge]] in the shift to [[expertise sharing]] in [[CSCW]] (cf. #[[@ackermanSharingKnowledgeExpertise2013]])

    - The author ([[Cedric Chin]]) might be someone interesting to rope into the [[idea: multiplayer zettelkastens]]
