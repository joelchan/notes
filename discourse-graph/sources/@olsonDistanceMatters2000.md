        - Abstract

            - Giant strides in information technology at the turn of the century may have unleashed unreachable goals. With the invention of groupware, people expect to communicate easily with each other and accomplish difficult work even though they are remotely located or rarely overlap in time. Major corporations launch global teams, expecting that technology will make "virtual collocation" possible. Federal research money encourages global science through the establishment of "collaboratories. " We review over 10 years of field and laboratory investigations of collocated and noncollocated synchronous group collaborations. In particular, we compare collocated work with remote work as it is possible today and comment on the promise of remote work tomorrow. We focus on the sociotechnical conditions required for effective distance work and bring together the results with four key concepts: common ground, coupling of work, collaboration readiness, and collaboration technology readiness. Groups with high common ground and loosely coupled work, with readiness both for collaboration and collaboration technology, have a chance at succeeding with remote work. Deviations from each of these create strain on the relationships among teammates and require changes in the work or processes of collaboration to succeed. Often they do not succeed because distance still matters.

            - Key theoretical concepts for thinking about [[remote work]]:

                - common ground

                - coupling of work

                - collaboration readiness

                - collaboration technology readiness

            - Scope

                - Note: "we compare collocated work with remote work as it is possible ^^today^^ and comment on the promise of remote work tomorrow" (p. 139) - this was in [[2000]]!

                - Focus on synchronous interactions (ignore asynchronous for now) (p. 141)

                - Settings considered (p. 142-144)

                    - Collocated = can get to workspace within 30m walk (p. 142), have shared space to be in together, and shared stuff to look at together

                        - Concrete example: "

                        - Caterpillar used Virtual Reality Cave technology from National Center for Supercomputing Applications to do real-time design sessions between"

                        - Europe and North America (Lehner & DeFanti, 1997).

                    - Distance "in the future": ++ design, ++ computing power, ++ bandwidth, ++ VR

            - Diff varieties of limits to replicating the richness and efficacy of [[information-rich, face-to-face communication]]:

                - **Pragmatic** limits (can't do it __yet__)

                - **Logical** limits (can't do it __in principle__) (this is the more important fundamental contribution and claim of the paper)

                    - > Our findings in these settings fall into two categories: behavior that will change for the better when the technology achieves certain qualities we think are possible in the next 20 years, and behavior that will never change. It is this second category we expand in the third part of the article, exploring why distance will continue to matter even with significant technological advances. (p. 141)

                    - This is similar to what [[@ackermanIntellectualChallengeCSCW2000]] argues, though on a different (perhaps broader) lens on social computing

                    - #[[QUE]]: What does it take to establish a "limits" argument?

            - Side notes:

                - > It is well known that any delay greater than 500 msec will severely disrupt conversational flow (Krauss & Bricker, 1967; Riez & Klemmer, 1963).

                    - There was that later thing on Zoom and synchrony....

            - Are the workarounds (de-coupling, adding formal protocols, pp. 152-153) similar to [[@ackermanIntellectualChallengeCSCW2000]]'s notion of first-order approximations?

            - The first two concepts seem like the most fundamental; the latter two (collaboration and tech readiness) more malleable

            - My questions:

                - #[[QUE]]: What does it take to establish a "limits" argument?

            - OK high level

                - Claims

                    - Degree of required/pre-existing common ground and task coupling independently and jointly determine whether remote work succeeds

                        - Corollary: in remote work, people will tend to change the nature of the process/work to reduce demands for common ground and task coupling (e.g., making the task/process more structured, loosening the coupling)

                    - People tend to change to accommodate bad tech rather than change the bad tech

[[computer-mediated communication]]

- see, .e.g, [[@olsonDistanceMatters2000]], [[@hollanBeingThere1992]], etc.

    - probably good to use these as seeds and explore citation tree forwards, can probably get some good stuff from [[sys/ConnectedPapers]]

    - also probably some good reviews out there on this, since it's such an old topic - might be a synthesis lectures
[[@yangEffectsRemoteWork2021]]

- very much reminiscent of what [[@olsonDistanceMatters2000]] predicted and saw in prior field studies: when remote, people adapt/accommodate by decreasing need for coupling and common ground (if remote tech makes it hard to do those) - this sort of suggests we still don't do this well at all

    - though the exogenous shock also includes a bunch of other stuff like disruptions and a LITERAL PANDEMIC!!
