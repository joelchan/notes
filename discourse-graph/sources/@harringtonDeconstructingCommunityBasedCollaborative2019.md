        - Abstract

            - Participatory Design (PD) is envisioned as an approach to democratizing innovation in the design process by shifting the power dynamics between researcher and participant. Recent scholarship in HCI and design has analyzed the ways collaborative design engagements, such as PD situated in the design workshop can amplify voices and empower underserved populations. Yet, we argue that PD as instantiated in the design workshop is very much an affluent and privileged activity that often neglects the challenges associated with envisioning equitable design solutions among underserved populations. Based on two series of community-based PD workshops with underserved populations in the U.S., we highlight key areas of tension and considerations for a more equitable PD approach: historical context of the research environment, community access, perceptions of materials and activities, and unintentional harm in collecting full accounts of personal narratives. By reflecting on these tensions as a call-to-action, we hope to deconstruct the privilege of the PD workshop within HCI and re-center the focus of design on individuals who are historically underserved.

            - ‚ÄúIf we wish to have accountability in these design engagements, we must reflexively acknowledge power dynamics between researchers and community partners, challenges of economic disadvantages in design engagements, and the labor required to build trust‚Äù (p. 17)

                - cf. [[metis]]

            - much research done using PD and in CSCW and HCI is funded by organizations and agencies who prioritize outcomes related to computing and technical innovations

            - In one of their design workshops, they wrote how the low-income, African-American, older adults in Chicago whom they co-designed with were skeptical of the intent behind the research agenda given historical discrimination their community has faced from the university

            - Adult co-designers expressed that design materials used including markers and colored pencils felt infantilizing and belittling.

            - design engagements that are truly participatory are ones that place citizen‚Äôs contributions at the forefront, including their voicing of communal issues and suggestions of real artifacts as solutions
