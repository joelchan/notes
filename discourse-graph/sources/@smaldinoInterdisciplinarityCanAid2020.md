        - Abstract

            - Why do bad methods persist in some academic disciplines, even when they have been clearly rejected in others?  What factors allow good methodological advances to spread across disciplines?  In this paper, we investigate some key features determining the success and failure of methodological spread between the sciences.  We introduce a model that considers factors like methodological competence and reviewer bias towards one's own methods.  We show how self-preferential biases can protect poor methodology within scientific communities, and lack of reviewer competence can contribute to failures to adopt better methods. We further argue, however, that input from outside disciplines, especially in the form of peer review and other credit assignment mechanisms, can help break down barriers to methodological improvement.

    - wow! [[Paul E. Smaldino]] was also author on [that classic paper on natural selection of bad science]([[@smaldinoNaturalSelectionBad2016]])???

        - credibility++ then: this person has been thinking deeply about this problem (to the extent of creating a significant (recognized by community as such by publication and citations) model of the dynamics of methods selection/persistence) for a significant period of time (at minimum 5ish years)

        - [supporting cites](https://scite.ai/reports/the-natural-selection-of-bad-WL8RV5?contradicting=false&mentioning=false&page=1&utm_campaign=badge_generic&utm_medium=plugin&utm_source=generic) (via [[sys/scite.ai]]) for [[@smaldinoNaturalSelectionBad2016]] are a goldmine of evidence for thinking through [[[[CLM]] - Prevailing incentives in academia are bad for science]]

            - of particular interest is [[@brembsPrestigiousScienceJournals2018]], which reviews a few lines of unique evidence where some fields have fairly "objective" (quantifiable) indices of methods quality that can be computed and compared, and this is used to observe whether/how methods quality varies with journal "rank" (finding is that there is an *inverse* correlation: worse methods in higher-ranking journals)

                - addresses concerns about [[retraction]] as an index of methods quality
