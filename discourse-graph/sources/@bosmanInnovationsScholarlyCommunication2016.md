        - Abstract

            - Innovations in scholarly communication - data of the global 2015-2016 survey. This data set contains: Full raw (anonymized) and cleaned data files of the 2015-2016 global Survey on Innovations in Scholarly Communication. Data are in xls¬†format (raw and cleaned) and csv format (only for cleaned data as the raw data contain non-Roman script). Survey questionnaires for 7 languages (zipped PDFs) Variable list (xls) Readme file (txt) The data files contain >3,000,000 cells, and thus cannot be opened in their entirety in Google Drive. Many new websites and online tools have come into existence to support scholarly communication in all phases of the research workflow. To what extent researchers are using these and more traditional tools has been largely unknown. This 2015-2016 survey aimed to fill that gap. Its results may help decision making by stakeholders supporting researchers and may also help researchers wishing to reflect on their own online workflows. In addition, information on tools usage can inform studies of changing research workflows. The online survey employed an open, non-probability sample. A largely self-selected group of 20663 researchers, librarians, editors, publishers and other groups involved in research took the survey, which was available in seven languages. The survey was open from May 10, 2015 to February 10, 2016. It captured information on tool usage for 17 research activities, stance towards open access and open science, and expectations of the most important development in scholarly communication. Respondents‚Äô demographics included research roles, country of affiliation, research discipline and year of first publication. A full description of data collection, survey response and methodology is in a data publication in F1000 Research: [Kramer, Bianca & Jeroen Bosman (2016)]([[@kramerInnovationsScholarlyCommunication2016]]) Innovations in scholarly communication - global survey on research tool usage.

            - Reference management tools like [[sys/EndNote]], [[sys/Mendeley]], and [[sys/Zotero]] were the most frequently mentioned "cite" tools by [researchers](~21k self-selected sample of researchers worldwide responding to an open online survey distributed through various channels) worldwide responding to an online survey in [[2015]]. These top 3 tools collectively accounted for ~60% of responses.
