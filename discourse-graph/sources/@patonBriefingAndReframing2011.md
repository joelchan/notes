        - Abstract

            - The ability to reframe a problematic situation in new and interesting ways is
widely seen as one of the key characteristics of design thinking. In this paper we
study how experienced designers have professionalised the crucial art of frame
communication and new frame adoption with their clients. During briefing,
professional designers elicit a client’s frame, reframe it to be more workable and
desirable, and reflect it back. In this study fifteen experienced visual communications designers were interviewed and asked about briefing activities for what they deemed to be ‘typical’ and ‘innovative’ projects. This yielded rich descriptions of strategies that these professional designers used to enable
reframing of the situation with clients, insights into possible difficulties and
patterns of briefing practices.

- Effective problem formulation is one of the most important aspects of the creative tasks ([[@goelStructureDesignProblem1992]]) such as design ([[@dorstFrameInnovationCreate2015]], [[@kolkoExposingMagicDesign2007]], [[@patonBriefingAndReframing2011]], [[@macneilFramingCreativeWork2021]]).

    - Q: What's the difference between creative knowledge work and creative tasks? Is creative knowledge work particularly for research? Is design one kind of knowledge work?

        - ^^[[From: [[Joel Chan]]]]: [[@[[Jason Ding]]]] yeah, design is one kind of creative knowledge work. I like to add the term "knowledge" to emphasize the conceptual aspect, rather than the artifact itself as the output; e.g., in design, I care less that you made a thing that works really well, and more that you've created a new understanding of how to approach or solve a particular problem, that others can build on. It's possible to make a thing that works really well by simple trial and error or brute force search, and have no idea how it works.^^
