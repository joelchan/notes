        - Abstract

            - This is the first of a two part paper summarizing and reviewing research in mechanical engineering design theory and methodology. Part I includes: 1) descriptive models; 2) prescrptive models; and 3) computer-based models of design processes. Part II, which will appear in the next issue of this journal, will include: 4) languages, representations, and environments for design; 5) analysis in support of design; and 6) design for manufacture and the life-cycle. For each major area, we discuss the current topics of research and the state of the art, emphasizing recent significant advances. We also discuss the important open research issues in each area. The six categories are certainly not mutually exclusive nor even collectively exhaustive; however, some organization is necessary, and these categories have been effective in making sense of a body of research that is expending rapidly in many exciting and promising directions. The mechanical engineering design research community has made major advances over the last few years. The research community in mechanical engineering design has made significant progress not only in advancing our knowledge of design, but also in clarifying the research methods necessary to study design. Great progress is being made toward a better understanding of design, and hence toward better design tools.
