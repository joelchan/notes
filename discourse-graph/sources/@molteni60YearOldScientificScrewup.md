    - this is about how we got to the misunderstanding about the 5 micron rule for aerosols and the resistance to recognizing that COVID is airborne, because of [bad citation practices]([[[[CLM]] - Citation practices in science are far from optimal]]) and dogma

        - related: [[@clausetDatadrivenPredictionsScience2017]] has lots of important notes about this
