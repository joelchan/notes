    - Chapter 18: The Domain Analytic Approach to Scholars' Information Practices

        - [[Domain-Analysis]] traced back to introduction of term "domain analysis" by [[@hjorlandNewHorizonInformation1995]]: basic idea is need to incorporate [[context]] when thinking about users' information behaviors, not just generic "users" (p.123)

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F4LppppxOk9?alt=media&token=11164832-86e5-4962-941e-9a4baa023e45)

            - Softer version of [[[[CLM]] - Knowledge is fundamentally contextual]]

        - But the idea goes back farther to classic studies from the 1930's, many published in 1958 INternatinoal Conference on Scientific Information (Bates, 1971)

            - Overarching theme: understanding disciplinary differences helps explain what's going on in terms of scholars' work and communication practices

                - One thought interspersed here: the fact that domains are different in ways that are consequential for information behavior might be one important reason that [[interdisciplinarity]] is hard: [need to learn to navigate multiple domains]([[Z: Interdisciplinary synthesis is hard because you have to navigate multiple, sometimes competing epistemologies]]), with changing strategies for [[ðŸ§± foraging]], etc.

                - Example classic papers

                    - Crane (1972) [[@craneInvisibleCollegesDiffusion1972]]

                        - Idea of [[Invisible Colleges]] (super foundational and influential idea)

                    - Menzel (1959) [[@menzelPlannedUnplannedScientific1959]]

                        - I think the idea here is that a surprising amount of communication occurs between scientists through "informal" channels? #[[Z]]

                            - Reminds me of hte [[@gruberDarwinManPsychological1974]] stuff on the distinction between private, semi-private, and public knowledge. Maybne also [[Undiscovered Public Knowledge]]? cf. also [[Z: Businesses frequently prefer informal to formal sources for their information needs]]??

                        - this probably causes and is caused by the cause of [[[[CLM]] - Substantial portions of knowledge that is critical for innovation are not written down]]

                    - Allen (1977) [[R: allen1977managing]]

                        - It's a book, can't easily grok what some TL;DR might be..

                    - Paisley (1968) [[@paisley1968information]]

                        - Need to get on ILL

                    - Parker & Paisley (1966) [[R: paisleyScientificInformationExchange1967]]

                    - Garvey (1979) [[@garveyCommunicationEssenceScience1979]]

                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FfoJXbURb3f?alt=media&token=c5d75e8c-c790-476e-a2c6-023150475700)

            - As of 2005, still lots ot learn about [[Domain-Analysis]] approach, particularly need to make it more systematic, per Palmer (1999), [[R: bates2002speculations]], and [[@hjorlandEpistemologySociocognitivePerspective2002]] (note: same author who introduced idea of domain analysis)

            - Some work considering how much of what we see in terms of domain differences transfer to "electronic era" (Kling & Covi, 1997; Kling & McKim, 2000)

            - From [[@hjorlandEpistemologySociocognitivePerspective2002]]

                - One example of differences between domains: idea of [[Epistemic Schools]], including empiricism, rationalism, historicism, and pragmatism. These schools differ in what knowledge they consider "relevant" or useful (as you might guess from epistemology).

                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2Fky39dQBCxX?alt=media&token=80e952c5-9c2a-4f88-ad59-54a46f332939)

            - Ah! As I suspected: some are arguing ([[@bates1996learning]]; [[@palmerAligningStudiesInformation1999]]) that [[interdisciplinarity]] influences scholars' information practices. SHould dig into that to get into what they're really saying about __how__ precisely the practices are impacted by degree of [[interdisciplinarity]]

            - Field size may also matter [[R: bates2002speculations]]

                - Context here: first-principles, logical kind of analysis, not systematic empirical evdience

                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F534uIL3-vw?alt=media&token=2712e8cb-b235-4bea-9a65-aad6c08acf3a)

            - All that is background for the main event: a summary of hte findings of [[@taljaReasonsUseNon2003]]

            - [[Scatter]] introduced by [[@moteReasonsVariationInformation1962]]  - low scatter domain = underlying principles well-developed (paradigmatic??), lit well organized, width of subject area relatively small and clearly defined

                - [[@bates1996learning]] claims [[interdisciplinarity]] typically characterized by high degree of [[Scatter]]

                    - Intriguing: there is an idea of [[SDI]] (Selective Dissemination of Information) as a way to deal with [[Scatter]], documented in part in [[@packerImportanceSDICurrent1979]]

                        - As described in [[@bates1996learning]], [[SDI]] is basically librarian-powered recommendation systems for scholars :) Really curious to see how these stack up against a rec sys.

    - {{[[DONE]]}} [[Joel Chan]] #TaskWrite Flesh out possible zettels about [[Domain-Analysis]] in conjunction with reading notes from relevant papers from [[@fisherTheoriesInformationBehavior2005]]

        - Domains vary substantially in what knowledge is considered "relevant", with very pragmatic implications for what kinds of information retrieval (and synthesis) tools should be designed (this is the idea of [[paradigmatic relevance]],. for example) [[@hjorlandEpistemologySociocognitivePerspective2002]] [[@taljaReasonsUseNon2003]]

            - Disciplines have deep-rooted and consequential differences in what counts as "relevant" information. Some are characterized by [[paradigmatic relevance]], where the meaning of terms, and what therefore counts as relevant results for that term, vary substantially by "school of thought". #Relevance

                - This has implications for reuse too I think, in [[synthesis]]: need to hold together varying conceptions of what makes something "relevant" and "reusable" (compounding the issues with [[context]] from [[CSCW]])

                    - {{embed: [[[[CLM]] - Specifying context for future reuse is costly]]}}

            - This line of work in general seems more focused on information seeking ([[ðŸ§± foraging]]), a lot less on [[synthesis]]
