        - Abstract

            - Our study investigated the use of annotations in an asynchronous crime-solving task. In Study 1, regardless of whether they anticipated a partner, participants had better performance if they annotated more about connections across documents. In Study 2, annotations that pointed to more connections across documents improved the performance of the second participant. Annotations that pointed to few connections across documents hurt performance, especially when people were more aware of their partners. This research suggests that future collaborative tools should help people discern useful from useless annotations.

        - if see good annotations (where good = annotations that point ou connections across many documents) led to better perofrmance, but seeing (and being aware of) lower-quality annotations from others hurt perforamnc
