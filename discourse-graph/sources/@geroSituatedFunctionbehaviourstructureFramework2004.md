- Title:: The situated function-behaviour-structure framework
- Author(s):: [[J. S. Gero]]
- Abstract:: This paper extends the [[[[THE]] - Gero's Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) framework]], which proposed eight fundamental processes involved in designing. That framework did not explicitly account for the dynamic character of the context in which designing takes place, described by the notion of situatedness. This paper describes this concept as a recursive interrelationship between different environments, which, together with a model of constructive memory, provides the foundation of a situated FBS framework. The eight fundamental processes are then reconstructed within this new framework to represent designing in a dynamic world
