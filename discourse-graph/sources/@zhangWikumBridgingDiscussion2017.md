        - Abstract

            - Large-scale discussions between many participants abound on the internet today, on topics ranging from political arguments to group coordination. But as these discussions grow to tens of thousands of posts, they become ever more difficult for a reader to digest. In this article, we describe a workflow called recursive summarization, implemented in our Wikum prototype, that enables a large population of readers or editors to work in small doses to refine out the main points of the discussion. More than just a single summary, our workflow produces a summary tree that enables a reader to explore distinct subtopics at multiple levels of detail based on their interests. We describe lab evaluations showing that (i) Wikum can be used more effectively than a control to quickly construct a summary tree and (ii) the summary tree is more effective than the original discussion in helping readers identify and explore the main topics.

    - #lit-context

        - This paper has made significant traction in the para-academic HCI / tools for thought community

            - Example: [[@kriegerChattingGlueCognitive2020]] references [[sys/Wikum]], and this piece has made significant waves in this community outside of academic HCI (unclear to me how much impact Krieger's piece has had within academic HCI)

    - #[[üìù lit-notes]]

        - **How did the authors approach their questions/problems?** ((most of this is going to come from the methods sections, although some info about conceptualization of key concepts might be relevant to pull from intro/lit-review)) #lit-context

        - **What did they find?** ((keep this as contextualized as possible; resist the urge to repeat claims or generalizations)) #[[observation-notes]]

- And of course, efforts like [[sys/Wikum]] [[@zhangWikumBridgingDiscussion2017]] show us other ways to "pull out" or "view" or "unspool" a conversation

    - The unspooling in Wikum still happens within the threaded conversation medium, but it doesn't have to stay there!
