            - In [[2006]], [conclusive titles]([[conclusive titles]] = titles that anticiapte conclusions and/or results of the research (also called "informative", "conclusion", or "full-sentence" titles)) were [most prevalent](((pMNX_HKnI))) in subfields [closely related to developmental biology](((BmYC_46C6))) (~50% of titles), especially in high-ranking journals (~80% of titles); in multidisciplinary sciences, the percentage was ~30%, and in veterinary sciences, the percentage was less than 1%!

        - lack of [[conclusive titles]] in some areas might be because it's too hard to distill their results/conclusions in a useful way into the title
