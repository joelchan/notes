        - [[Zhang comprehensive process model of [[üß± sensemaking]]]] (p. 1751)

        - Most previous work on [[üß± sensemaking]] has focused a lot on the [[üß± foraging]] aspect (p. 1736)

        - The task matters (cf. [[[[CLM]] - Requirements for sensemaking come from the particulars of the work task]]) (p. 1750)

- Outside of lit reviewing and scholarly synthesis specifically we have a large number of models, with one recent synthesis of models by [[@zhangpengyiComprehensiveModelCognitive2014]] - best in this thread rn is [[@zhangCognitiveMechanismsSensemaking2020]]

- [[@zhangpengyiComprehensiveModelCognitive2014]]

    - Integrates [[@russellCostStructureSensemaking1993]] and other models of sensemaking from [[LIS]] into a comprehensive model
[[September 1st, 2021]]

- The most recent comprehensive theoretical process model of the sensemaking loop is in [[@zhangpengyiComprehensiveModelCognitive2014]].

    - Notice that even there there is a "data loop" (information-seeking), and a structure loop.

        - ((0fJ_qW_uA))
[[October 27th, 2021]]

- inspired by sensemaking measures of loops between "schema level" and "data level", e.g., [[Learning Loop Complex]] [[@russellCostStructureSensemaking1993]] and protocol studies like [[@zhangpengyiComprehensiveModelCognitive2014]]
