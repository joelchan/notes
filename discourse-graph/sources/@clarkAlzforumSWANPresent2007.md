        - Abstract

            - Scientists drove the early development of the World Wide Web, primarily as a means for rapid communication, document sharing and data access. They have been far slower to adopt the web as a medium for building research communities. Yet, web-based communities hold great potential for accelerating the pace of scientific research. In this article, we will describe the 10-year experience of the Alzheimer Research Forum ('Alzforum'), a unique example of a thriving scientific web community, and explain the features that contributed to its success. We will then outline the SWAN (Semantic Web Applications in Neuromedicine) project, in which Alzforum curators are collaborating with informatics researchers to develop novel approaches that will enable communities to share richly contextualized information about scientific data, claims and hypotheses.

- [[std/SWAN]] was actually instantiated in a working system, and was supposed to connect to [[sys/Alzforum]] (see [[@clarkAlzforumSWANPresent2007]])

    - But... I can't see a trace of it in the current [[sys/Alzforum]] website (e.g., would expect it to be listed somehow in their [list of databases](https://www.alzforum.org/databases), but it's not), even though it's still active, and there is active sharing and discussion of papers. What gives?

    - As far as I can tell, they did implement it

        - See, e.g., this screenshot of the pilot interface

    - The motivation is remarkably similar to what we are talking about: retaining the [[context]] of sensemaking, zeroing on the things we actually care about (the **semantics**)

    - They even think about a [[federation]] approach!!!!!! MySWAN, connecting together into a community SWAN!!!!!
