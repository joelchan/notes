        - Abstract

            - We blend network and organizational memory perspec- tives in a model of technology brokering that explains how an organization develops innovative products. The model is grounded in observations, interviews, informal conversations, and archived data gathered during an eth- nography of IDEO,a product design firm. This firm ex- ploits its network position, working for clients in at least 40 industries, to gain knowledge of existing technological solutions in various industries. It acts as a technology broker by introducing these solutions where they are not known and, in the process, creates new products that are original combinations of existing knowledge from dispa- rate industries. Designers exploit their access to a broad range of technological solutions with organizational routines for acquiring and storing this knowledge in the or- ganization's memory and, by making [analogies]([[analogy]]) between current design problems and the past solutions they have seen, retrieving that knowledge to generate new solutions to design problems in other industries. We dis- cuss the implications of this research for understanding the individual and organizational processes and norms underlying technology and knowledge transfer more generally.

    - [[Joel Chan]]'s [[üìù lit-notes]] | ethnographic study of IDEO shows centrality of intentional analogical innovation to their design work, powered by a mix of organizational routines, hybrid human-artifact distributed storage and maintenance of analogical knowledge, and intentional (in)formal social norms

                - how might an organizational memory be organized differently to optimize for brokerage, exaptation, and analogy?

                    - interesting: past lit framing here seems to conflate organizational memory with routinization (like... fixation?)

                - i'm struck by how visually impoverished this paper is! aching for some figures of the network, screenshots/pictures of the workspaces, the cabinets, the crash carts.. so many wonderfully rich artifacts to learn from!
