        - Abstract

            - We blend network and organizational memory perspec- tives in a model of technology brokering that explains how an organization develops innovative products. The model is grounded in observations, interviews, informal conversations, and archived data gathered during an eth- nography of IDEO,a product design firm. This firm ex- ploits its network position, working for clients in at least 40 industries, to gain knowledge of existing technological solutions in various industries. It acts as a technology broker by introducing these solutions where they are not known and, in the process, creates new products that are original combinations of existing knowledge from dispa- rate industries. Designers exploit their access to a broad range of technological solutions with organizational routines for acquiring and storing this knowledge in the or- ganization's memory and, by making [analogies]([[analogy]]) between current design problems and the past solutions they have seen, retrieving that knowledge to generate new solutions to design problems in other industries. We dis- cuss the implications of this research for understanding the individual and organizational processes and norms underlying technology and knowledge transfer more generally.

                - how might an organizational memory be organized differently to optimize for brokerage, exaptation, and analogy?

                    - interesting: past lit framing here seems to conflate organizational memory with routinization (like... fixation?)

                - i'm struck by how visually impoverished this paper is! aching for some figures of the network, screenshots/pictures of the workspaces, the cabinets, the crash carts.. so many wonderfully rich artifacts to learn from!

    - (Counter claim) Depending on which theory to explain observations away, for the IDEO case, information about potential solutions reside in physical artifacts, which demonstrate that organization of people, and produces exhibit "networks of juxtaposed components."

[[ISS - Read and dgraph notes for @hargadonTechnologyBrokeringInnovation1997]]

- [[[[EVD]] - Technical design knowledge at IDEO that was used for analogical inspiration resided in a mix of artifacts, prototypes, and designers' memories, and was actively maintained through routines of access in design work - [[@hargadonTechnologyBrokeringInnovation1997]]]]

    - especially designers as points of access (understood from managers) to diverse porfolios of knowledge as they deepened their expertise in a few domains
[[October 22nd, 2021]]

- Research on collaborative creativity has shown that task-appropriate artifacts and systems, design artifacts such as prototypes [[@hargadonTechnologyBrokeringInnovation1997]] and post-it notes [[@doveGroupingNotesNodes2018]], or group decision-support software for mapping out issues [[@selvinConstructingKnowledgeArt2014]][[@ariasEnvisionmentDiscoveryCollaboratory2015]]  can significantly augment people's ability to co-create powerful new ideas with others.

    - Key cites for this include the work of [[Simon Buckingham Shum]] as well as [[Gerhard Fischer]]

- [[@hargadonTechnologyBrokeringInnovation1997]] for [[[[QUE]] - What are the most efficient routes to useful cross-boundary knowledge?]] |

    - A designer retrieved an idea for a hinge design from a plastic toy dragon they had worked on the past, to generate a new idea for a hinge mechanism for a new portable computer. This happened without an external memory aid or artifact.

    - [[Xin Qian]]'s reading notes here: [[@hargadonTechnologyBrokeringInnovation1997]] ‚û∞ breadcrumbs]]

        - This paper introduces the [[model of technology **brokering**]] through the ethnography study of a product design company IDEO

            - IDEO designers are the brokers

        - (Semi-supportive claim) Upper-level managers are hub of information, quasi-librarians, informal reference systems. This applies to other employees during brainstorm sessions.

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FFeuGcFc4vk.png?alt=media&token=0553387e-ca50-435e-8dbc-4672d003eb93) (p.737)

            - Semi-supportive as there is no comparison with written product

        - (Semi-supportive claim) In the firm IDEO, people answer knowledge-related questions through instant written product

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F4oYBvGTj1V.png?alt=media&token=a717eebd-9548-40de-bb41-852590fe776e) (p.740)

        - (Semi-supportive claim) knowledge is stored as organizational memory (sometimes artifacts, some time the people as experts) until future design projects come up

        - (Counter claim) Depending on which theory to explain observations away, for the IDEO case, information about potential solutions reside in physical artifacts, which demonstrate that organization of people, and produces exhibit "networks of juxtaposed components."

[[June 17th, 2022]]

- basically can think of diff. combinations of methods and scope to go from MVP to full-blown multi-year ethnography style thing (think [[@hargadonTechnologyBrokeringInnovation1997]] or even [[@vertesiShapingScienceOrganizations2020]] level)

    - methods

        - semi-structured interviews, ideally contextual, guided tours. kinda like [[@luceroFramingAligningParadoxing2012]] and what we did with [[@morabitoManagingContextScholarly2021]]

        - think-alouds working through a problem

        - observations/recordings of collaborative discussions

        - traces of artifacts: notes, drafts, published works, etc.

        - immersion in 1+ projects over period of time, tying these together

        - intervention / participatory action research: follow a team both before (baseline) and during and after deployment and change: this is what excites me the most: observe infrastructural change in motion!!!!!!!!!

    - scope

        - tools

        - stages in lifecycle

        - personal vs. collaborative

        - number of projects
[[@hargadonTechnologyBrokeringInnovation1997]]

- [[[[EVD]] - Intentional organizational routines, both formal and informal, such as brainstorming and regular meetings, emails, informal conversations, served as main sites of analogical retrieval and circulation of technical knowledge at IDEO - [[@hargadonTechnologyBrokeringInnovation1997]]]]

        - studying an industry through catalogs, stores, show and tell etc.

            - btw, this is cc [[[[CLM]] - examples can improve creative outcomes by enabling more robust (re)modeling of the problem space]]

                - e.g., similar to [[[[EVD]] - professional designers curated examples to understand trends and design approaches to inform their design, vs. simple direct transfer of solution approaches - [[@sharminUnderstandingKnowledgeManagement2009b]]]]
