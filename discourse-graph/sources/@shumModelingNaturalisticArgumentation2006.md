        - Abstract

            - This article characterizes key weaknesses in the ability of current digital libraries to support scholarly inquiry, and as a way to address these, proposes computational services grounded in semiformal models of the naturalistic argumentation commonly found in research literatures. It is argued that a design priority is to balance formal expressiveness with usability, making it critical to coevolve the modeling scheme with appropriate user interfaces for argument construction and analysis. We specify the requirements for an argument modeling scheme for use by untrained researchers and describe the resulting ontology, contrasting it with other domain modeling and semantic web approaches, before discussing passive and intelligent user interfaces designed to support analysts in the construction, navigation, and analysis of scholarly argument structures in a Web-based environment

        - Describes the representation scheme behind the [[std/ScholOnto]] ontology for formally modeling [[discourse]] ([[Claim]]s and so on), but also more significantly, a suite of real {{alias: [[system-for]] systems for}} getting scholars to actually do this in a way that integrates with their existing [[scholarly workflows]] - that is, a [[scholar-powered model of semantic publishing]]
