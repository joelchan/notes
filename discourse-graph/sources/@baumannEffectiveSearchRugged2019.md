- [[@baumannEffectiveSearchRugged2019]] and [[@csaszarHowMuchCopy2010]] are entry points into organizational lit that articulates variants of this relating to 'copying' / imitation - with one idea being that simple copying is different from "lossy" copying that induces/complements experential learning (making your own moves)

        - cites [[@lazerNetworkStructureExploration2007]], which is entry point into [this thread](Came across a series of papers that add more nuance to the idea of [[[[CLM]] - Universal Semantic Webs are neither feasible nor useful]], but this time regarding the desirability of a fully connected network with *no* friction to information sharing #[[Z]], and also relevant for [[D/Solution-Diversity]]) about the [[Zollman Effect]] (roughly: the more you know from your competitors, the worse off the global max is)

            - it's more tuned at "finding the truth", rather than ideation, so keep that in mind.
