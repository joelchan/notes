- [[@[[AJ Rudd Jr]]]] re: [Grudin article]([[~[[Joel Chan]]]] The [Grudin article](https://sci-hub.do/https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327051hci0602_3) from the Kujala paper so far isn't a study of any sort. It is just effectively an opinion article about some consequences of not involving users(so far). Is there a special way to do this article because my understanding is that you were looking for more concrete observations. I could totally be wrong just wanted to check before I get into this paper in detail): looks like just opinion, should we write `observation notes` from it? (relevant for developing [[[[PTN]] - discourse graph]])

    - We get to decide!

    - It would at least be useful as a source of possible synthesis notes.

    - But if the author is speaking from some kind of specific, unique experience (e.g., many years of experience running co-design sessions), it could count as an observation note.

    - One clue as to the degree to which this is an `observation note` is the extent to which we can judge something like the following:

        - > this is the basis on which the author is contributing this observation (ideally also how we might reproduce it"

        - This is still a work in progress, but the general direction of the heuristic is sound, I think.

        - In the specific case of this article, let's look at some cues:

            - more insight at the end of the intro for the [question of basis](> this is the basis on which the author is contributing this observation (ideally also how we might reproduce it"): we can think of this solo-authored article as sort of an extended transcript of an interview with a very knowledgeable expert sharing their beliefs

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FhKP-5bqguo.png?alt=media&token=16ddddd7-8db1-4699-9530-9d9d3c69be5d)

            - abstract signals some clues about the [question of basis](> this is the basis on which the author is contributing this observation (ideally also how we might reproduce it"): "examples and logical argument"

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2Fy0yx8n9Xue.png?alt=media&token=014351eb-c4b6-4050-8ddd-c59d93c9ce14) (from abstract)

                - suspect **logical argument** here is less formal than a. in any case, it's not empirical in a reproducible sense, so that alone wouldn't make the claims observation notes.

                - the **examples** might be observation notes if they are sufficiently richly described

    - Based on [this quick analysis](In the specific case of this article, let's look at some cues:), I think it would be reasonable in this case to make `observation notes` from this paper.
