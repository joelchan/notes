        - Abstract

            - The paper examines the acquisition, depreciation and transfer of knowledge acquired through learning by doing in service organizations. The analysis is based on weekly data collected over a one and a half year period from 36 pizza stores located in Southwestern Pennsylvania. The 36 stores, which are franchised from the same corporation, are owned by 10 different franchisees. We find evidence of learning-in these service organizations: as the organizations gain experience in production, the unit cost of production declines significantly. Knowledge acquired through learning by doing is found to depreciate rapidly in these organizations. Knowledge is found to transfer across stores owed by the same franschisee but not across stores owned by different franchisees. Theoretical and practical implications of the work are discussed.

- Case Study of making pizza was not in this paper, despite being cited. We tracked it down to [[@darrAcquisitionTransferDepreciation1995]], but even here it's not actually a result, but a contrived example

    - Harder to share how to hand-toss a pizza (tacit) than to share the cook time of different pizza (explicit)

    - Experts usually only tell part of the story (explicit part) about task that require tacit knowledge (hand-tossing a pizza)

- In [[@darrAcquisitionTransferDepreciation1995]], transfer can could happen because of more frequent meeting between commonly owned store than differently owned store.

- discussed [[@eppleEmpiricalInvestigationMicrostructure1996]] and [[@darrAcquisitionTransferDepreciation1995]] for [[D/KNEXT]]

    - takeaways:

        - transfer happens

            - more easily between commonly owned store than differently owned store [[@darrAcquisitionTransferDepreciation1995]]

        - mechanism of transfer is not specified in these studies, due to the nature of the data

            - In [[@darrAcquisitionTransferDepreciation1995]], transfer can could happen because of more frequent meeting between commonly owned store than differently owned store.

            - [[@eppleEmpiricalInvestigationMicrostructure1996]] speculated that transfer can be deliberaly facilitated through managerial and engineering attention

        - Potential new mechanism of transfer for tacit knowledge other than writing it down (bad way) or apprenticeship (expensive way)

            - Embodied, Embedded (Plans and Situated Actions)

                - For example, flashing light in a manufacturing plant to indicate something is wrong in the belt. Everyone at the plant knows what to do when this happens.

            - Artifacts (Affordances of the object could tell people how to use the tools without instructions)

                - Imitation and tool usage.
