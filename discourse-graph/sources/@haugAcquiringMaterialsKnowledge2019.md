            - Abstract

                - Product material choices affect how a product will be manufactured, how it will function, and how it will be experienced. Thus, understanding materials is essential for designers in many regards. However, materials used in designs are subject to ongoing changes in availability, processing methods, price and attributed meanings. Furthermore, new materials are constantly being developed. Therefore, designers continuously need to acquire new materials knowledge (i.e., internalisation of facts, information, and skills) to be able to produce designs that utilise available material possibilities and achieve the desired user experiences. However, although this topic has been dealt with to some extent, a detailed classification of approaches for how designers can acquire materials knowledge is absent in the literature. To provide designers and design educators with a structured basis for understanding/teaching materials knowledge acquisition, this paper develops a framework that defines twelve distinct ways for designers to acquire materials knowledge.

    - empirical studies (hopefully) that document the ways in which material selection in industrial design go beyond "mere" technical considerations/properties (e.g., subjective user experiences)

- One #idea might be to build on [[@haugAcquiringMaterialsKnowledge2019]] to create a mapping of senso-aesthetic properties of machine learning as a design material to start the conversation about [[material knowledge]] of AI/ML as a design material for [[P/Material Knowledge of ML for Design]]

    - Could submit this to [[FAccT]] conference?

        - Deadline is mid-to-late August, and conference is in late January, in Toronto next year

        - But could be good for [[conf/CHI]] as well, or other conferences like [[conf/DIS]]

    - Similar potential inspiration in [[@amershiGuidelinesHumanAIInteraction2019]]
