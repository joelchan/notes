        - Abstract

            - Previous studies have shown that a predominant tendency in creative generation tasks is to base new ideas on well-known, specific instances of previous ideas (e.g., basing ideas for imaginary aliens on dogs, cats or bears). However, a substantial minority of individuals has been shown to adopt more abstract approaches to the task and to develop more original products as a result. Because domain knowledge is sometimes thought to be associated with more abstract representations, it is possible that these individual differences are linked to how much people have learned about the domain in question. The present study explored the relationship between domain knowledge, the tendency to rely on specific domain instances and both the originality and practicality of outcomes in a task in which participants designed novel sports. In addition to designing novel sports, participants rated their own knowledge about and participation in sports, and they took a short test of sport knowledge. As in previous studies, there were individual differences in approaches to the task, and participants who relied on specific known sports (e.g., basketball) produced less original designs. Neither the measures of sport knowledge nor the measure of sport participation related to the tendency to rely on specific instances in developing the novel sports or to the originality of those creations. However, there were links between tested knowledge and the rated practicality of the designs.
