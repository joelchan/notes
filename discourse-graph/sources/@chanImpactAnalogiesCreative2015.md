        - Abstract

            - Research on innovation often highlights analogies from sources outside the current problem domain as a major source of novel concepts; however, the mechanisms underlying this relationship are not well understood. We analyzed the temporal interplay between far analogy use and creative concept generation in a professional design teams brainstorming conversations, investigating the hypothesis that far analogies lead directly to very novel concepts via large steps in conceptual spaces (jumps). Surprisingly, we found that concepts were more similar to their preceding concepts after far analogy use compared to baseline situations (i.e., without far analogy use). Yet, far analogies increased the teams concept generation rate compared to baseline conditions. Overall, these results challenge the view that far analogies primarily lead to novel concepts via jumps in conceptual spaces, and suggest alternative pathways from far analogies to novel concepts (e.g., iterative, deep exploration within a functional space).

            - examples of analogies included (not exhaustive, but roughly 60/40 ratio of near to far analogies *overall*, so it's a mix: but we don't know what the breakdown is for each team):

                - near

                    1. restaurant roll-out bib

                    1. plastic lid for a cup

                    1. airplane foldout table

                    1. restaurant take-out tray

                    1. drink holders

                    1. lunch box

                - far

                    1. airplane oxygen mask

                    1. superabsorbent cloth

                    1. bean bags

                    1. dentist's swing light

        - idea-generated from analogies events were central to each of the four design teams' processes
