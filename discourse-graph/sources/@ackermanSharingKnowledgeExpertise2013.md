        - [[[[CLM]] - CSCW research on knowledge sharing shifted from a repository model to an expertise sharing model around the mid-2000's - [[@ackermanSharingKnowledgeExpertise2013]]]]

        - The shift from the "[[repository model]]" of CSCW work to focus on "[[expertise sharing]]" was stimulated in large part by rich discoveries about the large extent to which useful knowledge is tacit and situated #[[tacit knowledge]] p.547

            - Cites [[@starInstitutionalEcologyTranslations1989]] to note that [[[[PTN]] - boundary object]]s were a key learning from the first generation "repository models" to motivate the shift to [[Expertise Sharing]]

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FNytKlvx_Gq.png?alt=media&token=03824ef6-44f8-4172-8c54-b8dc04c83bd7)

                - [[[[PTN]] - boundary object]]s derive part of their power (for facilitating cross-organizational/boundary coordination and work) by being "weakly structured in common use, and strongly structured in specific use"

        - [[[[CLM]] - Specifying context for future reuse is costly]]

            - #ClaimSecondary people find adding meta-data to be laborsome [[@hinrichsContextGrabbingAssigning2005]]

            - #ClaimSecondary people tend to use the category with the lowest cognitive effort [[@andersonDataBaseMent2008]]

                - [[@andersonDataBaseMent2008]] call these "residual categories"

                - it can be quite hard to standardize (and therefore make efficient) expressions of [[context]] (e.g., in a dropdown menu of possible "contexts")
