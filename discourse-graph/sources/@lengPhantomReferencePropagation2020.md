            - We might assume that a paper has to exist to be referenced. But Kroonenberg and Harzing (2017) discovered a non-existent “phantom” paper that has been cited more than 400 times: Van der Geer, J., Hanraads, JAJ., Lupton, RA. ([2000]2010).

###### Discourse Context

- **Informs::** [[CLM - Synthesis work requires explicit (usually external) representations of both evidence and claims]]
- **SourceFor::** [[EVD - A style guide example citation (not a real paper) was copied by more than 10 later papers to support claims of therapeutic effects of Rutin - @lengPhantomReferencePropagation2020]]

###### References

- [[@lengPhantomReferencePropagation2020]] is a really striking #example-of the asymmetry in costs of error detection (in this case of phantom citations)

    - [[[[EVD]] - A style guide example citation (not a real paper) was copied by more than 10 later papers to support claims of therapeutic effects of Rutin - [[@lengPhantomReferencePropagation2020]]]]

        - In particular, the analysis supports the idea that [[[[CL]] - Scientists frequently copy citations without reading/checking them]]

                - [[@harzingPersistentMythHigh1995]] is another really striking example, arguing that "there is almost no empirical foundation for the existence of high failure rates when measured as premature re-entry. The persistent myth of high expatriate failure rates seems to have been created by massive (mis)quotations of three articles. Only one of these articles contained solid empirical evidence on expatriate failure rates and in fact showed them to be rather low"

                    - the author followed up on this with some more analysis later and showed that the problem had gotten worse, not better [[@harzingAreOurReferencing2002]]
