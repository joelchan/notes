        - Abstract

            - This is a report from an international workshop focused on the future of design fixation research within the broader context of work on creativity and inspiration. Fixation studies have already generated many useful results but there are clear opportunities to better connect with work done on other related concepts and work done in other disciplines. This would allow fixation research to broaden and strengthen its methodological approaches, offering richer insights into how design ideas originate and how they subsequently evolve. Such knowledge could then be applied to influence the development of design education, training and tools. In this way, fixation research would maximize its potential to provide insights into the creative process, improve design practice and thereby support innovation.

- and also some nice reviews, including [[@crillyWhereNextResearch2017]], which puts the phenomenon in larger context of the field, and [[@vasconcelosInspirationFixationQuestions2016]], which maps out many dimensions of variation

    - note that both of these papers are by [[Nathan Crilly]], who I should really get to know better, judging from his ongoing active, cumulative, thoughtful work on [[ðŸ§± fixation]]
