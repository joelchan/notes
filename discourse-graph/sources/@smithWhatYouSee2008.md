        - Abstract

            - What causes impasses, and what facilitates resolution of impasses in creative invention? What are the effects of information external to people engaged in creative discovery? Material in ones environment that can add information, ideas, or knowledge to the discovery process are provocative stimuli. Do provocative stimuli cause cognitive impasses, or do they facilitate resolution of impasses? New experiments address these research questions in the context of creative design and invention. The results may influence theoretical models of discovery and innovation, and may be instrumental in the development of effective methods for improving and accelerating creative thinking in invention and design.
