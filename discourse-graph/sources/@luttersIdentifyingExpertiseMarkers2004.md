###### Discourse Context

- **Informs::** [[QUE - How can we best bridge private vs. public knowledge]]

###### References

[[October 25th, 2021]]

- The other thought this sparks is a connection back to [[@luttersIdentifyingExpertiseMarkers2004]] [[micronotes]] and [[@bernsteinInformationScrapsHow2008]] information scraps (from [[Max Van Kleek]])

    - The **opportunity cost** of having a formalism that excludes really really important elements, is too high to adopt for creative knowledge work

        - This is a subset or specific instantiation of the general [[[[CLM]] - (premature) formalism considered harmful]]

        - In this case, a formalism that excludes speculation, for example, or rough scraps that we don't know what to do with yet, will prematurely kill the creative process

            - cc [[@sosaAccretionTheoryIdeation2019]]'s notion of [[ideasimals]]

            - Really hitting the theme of how important it is to have the informal live alongside the formal: asked about [[abduction]], and where that lives in here - my sense is that [[[[PTN]] - discourse graph]] don't represent abduction, but support it (by having something to talk back to); similar to [[Chinmay Kulkarni]]'s question about speculation

            - {{embed: Another goes back to the idea of how we can best evaluate interventions into the creative process, knowing that it is a complex dynamical system that is constantly in flux. ((need to refactor this high-level zettelkasten: [[[[CLM]] - Ideas develop simultaneously at multiple timescales, levels of granularity, and completeness]]) A myopic focus on "did it give me something right now that I can recognize as immediately useful" is very dangerous.}}

        - [[@ackermanIntellectualChallengeCSCW2000]] throughout this piece i am mentally translating "social activity" for "sensemaking" or "creative knowledge work" or "synthesis" - e.g., "{social activity | synthesis work} is fluid and nuanced, and this makes systems technically difficult to construct properly and often awkward to use" (p. 181)
