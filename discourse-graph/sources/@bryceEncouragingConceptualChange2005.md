    - Method

        - semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 physics students, 15 male and 6 female

        - Students were split into 3 groups

            - group 1 which had prior knowledge of Newton's third law

            - group 2 who had knowledge of Forces only

            - group 3 who had no prior teaching

        - They asked participants questions after showing the analogies to demonstrate to what extent they were able to transfer their knowledge

        - Students were provided four analogies that demonstrate force concepts and were asked questions in order to assess conceptual changes in their thinking.
