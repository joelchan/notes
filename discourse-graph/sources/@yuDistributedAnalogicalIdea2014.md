        - Abstract

            - Harnessing crowds can be a powerful mechanism for in- creasing innovation. However, current approaches to crowd innovation rely on large numbers of contributors generating ideas independently in an unstructured way. We introduce a new approach called distributed analogical idea generation, which aims to make idea generation more effective and less reliant on chance. Drawing from the literature in cognitive science on analogy and schema induction, our approach decomposes the creative process in a structured way amena- ble to using crowds. In three experiments we show that distributed analogical idea generation leads to better ideas than example-based approaches, and investigate the conditions under which crowds generate good schemas and ideas. Our results have implications for improving creativity and building systems for distributed crowd innovation.

- Tried: principle, diagram, summary; best is dissimilar analogs (similar to [[@yuDistributedAnalogicalIdea2014]]) - again, here it's **interaction** between more than one analog/source

    - but also the base rate overall is still lower than the hint conditions
