- Title:: Using bridging analogies and anchoring intuitions to deal with students' preconceptions in physics

Instructional techniques such as class discussions of the validity of an analogy between a target problem and an intuitive anchoring example, and forming a structured chain of intermediate bridging analogies were used. There were large differences in preposttest gains in favor of the experimental group. In formulating a model of learning processes that can explain these results, it is argued that (a) the lessons have a more complex structure than a simple model of analogy use; (b) rational methods using analogy and other plausible reasoning processes that are neither proof based nor directly empirical can play a very important role in science instruction; (c) much more effort than is usually allocated should be focused on helping students to make sense of an analogy; and (d) researchers and curriculum developers should be focusing at least as much attention on students' useful prior knowledge as they are on students' alternative conceptions.

        - Abstract

            - Lessons were designed to deal with students' alternative conceptions in three areas of mechanics: static normal forces, frictional forces, and Newton's third law for moving objects. Instructional techniques such as class discussions of the validity of an analogy between a target problem and an intuitive anchoring example, and forming a structured chain of intermediate bridging analogies were used. There were large differences in preposttest gains in favor of the experimental group. In formulating a model of learning processes that can explain these results, it is argued that (a) the lessons have a more complex structure than a simple model of analogy use; (b) rational methods using analogy and other plausible reasoning processes that are neither proof based nor directly empirical can play a very important role in science instruction; (c) much more effort than is usually allocated should be focused on helping students to make sense of an analogy; and (d) researchers and curriculum developers should be focusing at least as much attention on students' useful prior knowledge as they are on students' alternative conceptions.

    - The students who were provided a bridge and an Anchor point were [observed having debates using analogies of their own](![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FtWCr76Iqf_.png?alt=media&token=bb2f9fda-a325-409b-a2d9-49823059e3ee)). Some even using far reaching analogies(Extreme cases as the author puts it) to make their point.

    - Students were observed [altering their mental models, showing a deeper understanding of the anchor point and were participating in thought discussions](![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FZHVc60PZ8e.png?alt=media&token=7524b6a7-1cba-4862-8a27-b83c2372c2bc)) which allowed for switch of their original disbelief of the analogy being made.
