        - Abstract

            - This is an investigation of Online Creativity. I will present a new account of the cognitive and social mechanisms underlying complex thinking of creative scientists as they work on significant problems in contemporary science. I will lay out an innovative methodology that I have developed for investigating creative and complex thinking in a real-world context. Using this method, I have discovered that there are a number of strategies that are used in contemporary science that increase the likelihood of scientists making discoveries. The findings reported in this chapter provide new insights into complex scientific thinking and will dispel many of the myths surrounding the generation of new concepts and scientific discoveries.

        - Book chapter - he never

        - But this work is super badass - was basically an extended [[m/Ethnography]]

    - #[[üìù lit-notes]]

        - super far (nonbiological) analogies mostly were used for explanations, and were super rare

        - explanations drew about equally from same and other organism

        - other organism analogies disproportionately powered hypothesis ideation (20 vs. 3), and to a lesser extent, experiment design discussions (12 to 9), compared to within-organism analogies

        - **How did the authors approach their questions/problems?** ((most of this is going to come from the methods sections, although some info about conceptualization of key concepts might be relevant to pull from intro/lit-review)) #lit-context

        - **What did they find?** ((keep this as contextualized as possible; resist the urge to repeat claims or generalizations)) #[[observation-notes]]

###### Discourse Context

- **Informs::** [[CLM - There is a 'Sweet Spot' in Analogical Distance. Somewhat far analogies lead to better creative outcomes than very near or very far analogies]]
- **Informs::** [[CLM - Analogies can be a powerful source of new innovations]]
- **Informs::** [[QUE - How might domain distance modulate the effects of analogies on creative output]]
- **SourceFor::** [[EVD - Molecular biologists with a reputation for innovation rarely used very far analogies in their...d mainly on analogies to the same or other biological organisms - @dunbarHowScientistsThink1997]]
- **SourceFor::** [[EVD - A molecular biologist who had made a major scientific conceptual change did not recall any of the spontaneous analogies used to enact that change - @dunbarHowScientistsThink1997]]
