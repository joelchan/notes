        - Abstract

            - This is an investigation of Online Creativity. I will present a new account of the cognitive and social mechanisms underlying complex thinking of creative scientists as they work on significant problems in contemporary science. I will lay out an innovative methodology that I have developed for investigating creative and complex thinking in a real-world context. Using this method, I have discovered that there are a number of strategies that are used in contemporary science that increase the likelihood of scientists making discoveries. The findings reported in this chapter provide new insights into complex scientific thinking and will dispel many of the myths surrounding the generation of new concepts and scientific discoveries.

        - Book chapter - he never

        - But this work is super badass - was basically an extended [[m/Ethnography]]

    - #[[üìù lit-notes]]

        - super far (nonbiological) analogies mostly were used for explanations, and were super rare

        - explanations drew about equally from same and other organism

        - other organism analogies disproportionately powered hypothesis ideation (20 vs. 3), and to a lesser extent, experiment design discussions (12 to 9), compared to within-organism analogies

- Dunbar also claims that [[[[CL]] - [[far analogies]] are systematically overrated in their importance for creative breakthroughs due to memory bias - [[@dunbarHowScientistsThink1997]]]]

    - One [support]([[SupportedBy]]) for this is a specific anecdote of tracing a significant discovery through a series of (near) analogies, and then asking the scientist to recall/recount the origins of that discovery: Dunbar found that [[[[EVD]] - A molecular biologist who had made a major scientific conceptual change did not recall any of the spontaneous analogies used to enact that change - [[@dunbarHowScientistsThink1997]]]]

[[QUE - How might domain distance modulate the effects of analogies on creative output]]

- For example, Dunbar traced the discovery process of four top molecular biology labs, and found that they rarely used far analogies to generate novel scientific concepts: [[[[EVD]] - Molecular biologists with a reputation for innovation rarely used very far analogies in their lab meetings while generating novel scientific concepts; instead, they relied mainly on analogies to the same or other biological organisms - [[@dunbarHowScientistsThink1997]]]]

    - This is a strong result, even though it isn't experimental, due to its high external validity. Despite lack of experimental controls, it at least puts a cap on the claim about far analogies being important/necessary for creative breakthroughs, at least in molecular biology.

- [[@dunbarHowScientistsThink1997]] for [[[[QUE]] - How might domain distance modulate the effects of analogies on creative output?]] | far analogies weren't really used at all to generate major conceptual changes in a sample of prize-winning molecular biologists; also, the biologists didn't really remember the analogies they used to generate the conceptual change

    - # #inspectionalread

        - first section is on the method: [[m/s/In vivo]]

            - has some nice implications for [[[[QUE]] - Is it possible to measure creativity in a scientifically precise way? If so, how?]]

            - then argues for scientific thinking as ideal domain to study and develop theories of creativity more generally

        - there's three sets of findings:

            1. analogy (focus on this)

            1. how they treat unexpected findings (not relevant to analogy)

                1. basically, they attend to it and work on it (instead of just try to explain it away as error)

                    1. contra [[confirmation bias]] seen in most lab experiments

                1. no analogy mentioned

            1. case study of conceptual change (focus on this)

            1. distributed reasoning (not relevant to analogy)

                1. seems more about collaboration (synchronous) than distributed in our sense??

                1. contra research on superiority of [[nominal groups]]

                    1. cf [[@sosaNominalGroupsOk2020]] and [[@suttonBrainstormingGroupsContext1996]]

                    1. explained in terms of lack of external validity in lab studies: no shared values and knowledge

        - The observation method was a kind of "before-during-after" design: interview before (focusing on current state of hypotheses, data, and next steps), audio-video tape during lab meeting, and interview after (focusing on how the lab meeting affected their knowledge). The overall focus was on understanding the emergence of new and significant scientific "concepts"

        - Positionality: spent 3 months setting up relationship, and had free access to the labs and to interview anyone, attend meetings, read all materials, etc.

        - Examples of new concepts and discoveries included discoveirng a new gene that controls cell differentiation, an explanation for cell proliferation to certain regions of the body (this one was actually caught on tape)

        - General coding approach: extension of [[m/Think-aloud protocols]] to group setting: unit of analysis is a "statement" (clause or sentence, with a verb phrase that they assume indicates the core mental operation emplyed).

        - case study of conceptual change (focus on this)

            - together, these results are quite significant: shows the incremental nature of progress that is hidden from view if we don't look at the details of the process with [[m/s/In vivo]] methods

                - cc [[[[CLM]] - Paths to creative breakthroughs are frequently oblique]] and [[[[CLM]] - A significant proportion of the benefits of analogical stimuli is oblique or indirect]]

                - reminds me of that one paper on long paths. ugh can't remember atm.

                - one implication here is that [[far analogies]] seem more important than they really are because they are easier to remember than the "prosaic" incremental steps that are actually super important to the process

                    - Basically, [[Kevin Dunbar]] is claiming here that [[[[CL]] - [[far analogies]] are systematically overrated in their importance for creative breakthroughs due to memory bias - [[@dunbarHowScientistsThink1997]]]]

                - in particular, the idea of model organisms as analogies is very similar to the way [[analogy]] use is described as model-based reasoning in  [[@nersessianHybridAnalogiesConceptual2009]]

            - episode of major conceptual change involved chain of exclusively [[near analogies]] - noted here as an example of the primacy of relatively near analogies

            - Old draft

                - [molecular biologists](Participants and Setting: 25 scientists (ranging from technicians/grad students to postdocs to senior scientists) across 4 molecular biology labs from a single major university, all with a reputation for innovation) with a reputation for innovation rarely used [very far (nonbiological)¬†analogies](((0mXe7k16u)))¬†[in their lab meetings](((bARJ_fZPw))) (only [2 occurrences observed in total](((yzyBTj9So)))); when they were, they were used for explanation purposes. In contrast, analogies to other organisms occurred quite frequently (57 occurrences in total), and were used to generate hypotheses, design and fix experiments, and generate explanations. Analogies to the same organism also occurred quite frequently (40 occurrences in total), and were used primarily to generate explanations, with some other uses for hypothesis-generation, and experiment design/fixes.

    - this completes: {{[[DONE]]}} Convert [[@dunbarHowScientistsThink1997]] #next
[[July 7th, 2021]]

- Authors claim that these results (particularly the [contrast in use of far analogies]([[[[EVD]] - Far analogies were rare and never used in psychology lab group meetings for reasoning (vs. mere mentions); far analogies were rare in colloquia as well, but were frequently used for reasoning - [[@sanerAnalogiesOutBlue1999]]]]) between lab group meetings and colloqiua) support the claim that [[[[CL]] - [[far analogies]] are systematically overrated in their importance for creative breakthroughs due to memory bias - [[@dunbarHowScientistsThink1997]]]]

    - I am not so sure, though! This rests on the assumption that no discovery and conceptual work is happening in colloquia. Only reasoning that happens in lab groups counts as real. Can see this as defensible for analogies from the presenter: in colloquia you're presenting fully formed work. And the "use" measure But what about analogies from the audience that are between-domain? Could those be generative in some way?

        - This study can't tease that out though. Could *maybe* look only at audience-generated between-domain analogies and see if there's anything going on there. But probably too small N to say anything. Could be an interesting case study though!

        - In general I think the shape is fine: generally low proportions of far analogies, and generally low proportions of those used in actual reasoning.
