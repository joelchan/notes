- Title:: Thinking can cause forgetting: Memory dynamics in creative problem solving.
- Author(s):: [[B. C. Storm]], [[G. Angello]], [[E. L. Bjork]]
- Abstract:: Research on retrieval-induced forgetting has shown that retrieval can cause the forgetting of related or competing items in memory (Anderson, Bjork, & Bjork, 1994). In the present research, we examined whether an analogous phenomenon occurs in the context of creative problem solving. Using the Remote Associates Test (RAT; Mednick, 1962), we found that attempting to generate a novel common associate to 3 cue words caused the forgetting of other strong associates related to those cue words. This problem-solving-induced forgetting effect occurred even when participants failed to generate a viable solution, increased in magnitude when participants spent additional time problem solving, and was positively correlated with problem-solving success on a separate set of RAT problems. These results implicate a role for forgetting in overcoming fixation in creative problem solving.

- Thinking about [[retrieval-induced forgetting]]: it's not really directly related to example exposure - here, people are practicing for memory retrieval, and the idea is related to inhibitory processes, which [[@stormThinkingCanCause2011]] hypothesizes (and shows evidence) that it is actually a way to *reduce* [[ðŸ§± fixation]], not an index of fixation per se.

    - So it's really about how [[[[CL]] - Executive functions, such as cognitive control and inhibition, are a net positive for generating creative ideas]]

    - Which is why I moved it out of the CLM about stimulating exploration from examples

    - In other words, people who have more inhibition ability are less susceptible to fixation from examples

        - this kind of relates to the relationship between [[cognitive control]] and creativity (see lots of stuff by [[Roger E. Beaty]], like [[@beatyWhyIdeasGet2012]] and [[@frithKeepingCreativityControl2021]])
