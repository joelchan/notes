How big a role do unconventional combinations of existing knowledge play in the impact of a scientific paper? To examine this question, Uzzi et al. (p. 468) studied 17.9 million research articles across five decades of the Web of Science, the largest repository of scientific research. Scientific work typically appeared to draw on highly conventional, familiar mixtures of knowledge. The highest-impact papers were not the ones that had the greatest novelty, but had a combination of novelty and otherwise conventional combinations of prior work.
Novelty is an essential feature of creative ideas, yet the building blocks of new ideas are often embodied in existing knowledge. From this perspective, balancing atypical knowledge with conventional knowledge may be critical to the link between innovativeness and impact. Our analysis of 17.9 million papers spanning all scientific fields suggests that science follows a nearly universal pattern: The highest-impact science is primarily grounded in exceptionally conventional combinations of prior work yet simultaneously features an intrusion of unusual combinations. Papers of this type were twice as likely to be highly cited works. Novel combinations of prior work are rare, yet teams are 37.7% more likely than solo authors to insert novel combinations into familiar knowledge domains.
Highly cited work is simultaneously conventional and unconventional.

            - Making an Impact

            - How big a role do unconventional combinations of existing knowledge play in the impact of a scientific paper? To examine this question, Uzzi et al. (p. 468) studied 17.9 million research articles across five decades of the Web of Science, the largest repository of scientific research. Scientific work typically appeared to draw on highly conventional, familiar mixtures of knowledge. The highest-impact papers were not the ones that had the greatest novelty, but had a combination of novelty and otherwise conventional combinations of prior work.

            - Novelty is an essential feature of creative ideas, yet the building blocks of new ideas are often embodied in existing knowledge. From this perspective, balancing atypical knowledge with conventional knowledge may be critical to the link between innovativeness and impact. Our analysis of 17.9 million papers spanning all scientific fields suggests that science follows a nearly universal pattern: The highest-impact science is primarily grounded in exceptionally conventional combinations of prior work yet simultaneously features an intrusion of unusual combinations. Papers of this type were twice as likely to be highly cited works. Novel combinations of prior work are rare, yet teams are 37.7% more likely than solo authors to insert novel combinations into familiar knowledge domains.

            - Highly cited work is simultaneously conventional and unconventional.

        - novelty and conventionality for each journal pair was then defined in terms of z-score of the observed frequency for that combination relative to a random distribution from the simulated citation network: higher z-score above 0 considered conventional (more common than expected by chance) and lower z-score below 0 considered more atypical/novel (less common than expected by chance)

        - then novelty and conventionality for each *paper* defined in terms of the median and 90th-percentile z-score of the distribution of journal-pair z-scores for that paper. for binary analysis, high and low for conventionality = above or below median, and high and low for novelty = below or above 0

        - i really really really wish we had some case studies of these combo high novelty high conventionality papers, in terms of what specific atypical combinations of journals (by proxy, domains of knowledge) were doing.

- some questioning of the novelty measure in a later paper ([[@bornmannWeMeasureNovelty2019]])  comparing it to [[@uzziAtypicalCombinationsScientific2013]]'s measure in terms of correlation to [[F1000 Prime]] ratings of biomed papers: depending on how you slice it, this is a plus or minus, since one key result in Wang is the asymmetry between home vs. foreign impact, and these F1000 tags are for papers that get recommended
