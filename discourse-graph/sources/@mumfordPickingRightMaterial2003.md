        - Abstract

            - Discusses what is perceived as an arbitrary and misleading distinction between critical and creative thinking, and argues that creativity is based on a set of complex information-processing skills, effective application of which often requires critical thinking. The authors review the results obtained in a series of studies that provide evidence showing that the quality of the information used in executing processes underlying problem solving represents an important influence on creativity. Broader implications of these findings for understanding creativity and the development of creative potential are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)
