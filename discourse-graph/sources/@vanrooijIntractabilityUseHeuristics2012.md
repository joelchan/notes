        - Abstract

            - Many cognitive scientists, having discovered that some computational-level characterization f of a cognitive capacity $${\phi}$$is intractable, invoke heuristics as algorithmic-level explanations of how cognizers compute f. We argue that such explanations are actually dysfunctional, and rebut five possible objections. We then propose computational-level theory revision as a principled and workable alternative.
