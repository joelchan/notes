        - Abstract

            - Many cognitive scientists, having discovered that some computational-level characterization f of a cognitive capacity $${\phi}$$is intractable, invoke heuristics as algorithmic-level explanations of how cognizers compute f. We argue that such explanations are actually dysfunctional, and rebut five possible objections. We then propose computational-level theory revision as a principled and workable alternative.

- And per [[[[EVD]] - assuming that there is a polynomial-time procedure for choosing solutions for an intractable function implies that P=NP - [[@vanrooijIntractabilityUseHeuristics2012]]]], it doesn't really make sense to define hard boundaries for science in terms of process

    - I think this is [[Paul Feyerabend]]'s point?

        - If we do, the risk of descending into [[Cargo Cult Science]] is SUPER HIGH
