- Title:: Development of Conceptual Flexibility in Intuitive Biology: Effects of Environment and Experience
- Author(s):: [[Nicole Betz]], [[John D. Coley]]
- Abstract:: Living things can be classified in many ways, such as taxonomic similarity (lions and lynx), or shared ecological habitat (ducks and turtles). The present studies used card-sorting and triad tasks to explore developmental and experiential changes in conceptual flexibility–the ability to switch between taxonomic and ecological construals of living things–as well as two processes underlying conceptual flexibility: salience (i.e., the ease with which relations come to mind outside of contextual influences) and availability (i.e., the presence of relations in one’s mental space) of taxonomic and ecological relations. We were also interested in the extent to which salience and availability of taxonomic and ecological relations predicted inductive inferences. Participants were 452 six to ten-year-olds from urban, suburban, and rural communities in New England. Across two studies, taxonomic relations were overwhelmingly more salient than ecological relations, although salience of ecological relations was higher among children from rural environments (Study 1) and those who engaged in unstructured exploration of nature (Study 2). Availability of ecological relations, as well as conceptual flexibility, increased with age, and was higher among children living in more rural environments. Notably, salience, but not availability, of ecological relations predicted ecological inferences. These findings suggest that taxonomic categories (i.e., groups that share both perceptual similarities and rich underlying structure) are a salient way to organize intuitive biological knowledge and that, critically, environmental richness and relevant experience contribute to the salience and availability of ecological knowledge, and thereby, conceptual flexibility in biological thinking. More generally, they highlight important linkages between domain-specific knowledge and domain-general cognitive abilities.

        - study 1

            - participants: 103 k-6 students in ~2000, from urban (n=55) and rural communities (n=49) in the US northeast

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F-Vz1fdkun6.png?alt=media&token=804e2cfc-0650-40a9-b700-bf18b89a0df1) (p. 5)

            - task: sort cards of species on a table, then explain why they formed each group

            - measure: groupings (n taxonomic pairs, n ecological pairs, and then percentage). **taxonomic** = two species from same taxonomic category (e.g., woodchuck-beaver, fern-milkweed), **ecological** = two species from same ecological category (e.g., loon-dragonfly, firefly-paper-birch)

            - measure: explanations for groupings. transcribed and coded by ~3-4 coders using [[m/constant comparative method]]. disagreements (reported as rare) resolved via discussion. not mutually exclusive - 1) taxonomic explanations, 2) ecological explanations, 3) appearance explanations, and other

        - study 2:

            - participants:

            - measure: conceptual flexibility = change in percentage of taxonomic vs. ecological pairs and explanations from a general card sort to a "triadic" sort that focused on either taxonomic or ecological properties (shared internal features vs. shared environmental interaction)

        - they care about *conceptual flexibility* - ability to switch between taxonomic and ecological construals of living things

                - taxonomic = grouping living things based on shared morphological / intrinsic features, or common parents (is-a)

                - ecological = thematic relations based on common habitat, function, interactions

                - this seems to be grounded here intuitively, rather than formally, though it roughly seems to map to [[entity categories]] (taxonomic) vs. [[relational categories]] (ecological) cc [[@gentnerRelationalCategories2005]], and reminds me of [[schema-driven analogizing]]: expert-novice stuff on how sources are selected, in particular "[[schema-driven analogizing]]" from experts (vs. case-driven from novices) [[@ballSpontaneousAnalogisingEngineering2004]]

        - oh weird, ppl used to think that thematic comes first (is easier, less "sophisticated), and then later taxonomic (more abstract). this seems like.... first-principles thinking as the main thing???
