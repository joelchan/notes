- Title:: Development of Conceptual Flexibility in Intuitive Biology: Effects of Environment and Experience
- Author(s):: [[Nicole Betz]], [[John D. Coley]]
- Abstract:: Living things can be classified in many ways, such as taxonomic similarity (lions and lynx), or shared ecological habitat (ducks and turtles). The present studies used card-sorting and triad tasks to explore developmental and experiential changes in conceptual flexibility–the ability to switch between taxonomic and ecological construals of living things–as well as two processes underlying conceptual flexibility: salience (i.e., the ease with which relations come to mind outside of contextual influences) and availability (i.e., the presence of relations in one’s mental space) of taxonomic and ecological relations. We were also interested in the extent to which salience and availability of taxonomic and ecological relations predicted inductive inferences. Participants were 452 six to ten-year-olds from urban, suburban, and rural communities in New England. Across two studies, taxonomic relations were overwhelmingly more salient than ecological relations, although salience of ecological relations was higher among children from rural environments (Study 1) and those who engaged in unstructured exploration of nature (Study 2). Availability of ecological relations, as well as conceptual flexibility, increased with age, and was higher among children living in more rural environments. Notably, salience, but not availability, of ecological relations predicted ecological inferences. These findings suggest that taxonomic categories (i.e., groups that share both perceptual similarities and rich underlying structure) are a salient way to organize intuitive biological knowledge and that, critically, environmental richness and relevant experience contribute to the salience and availability of ecological knowledge, and thereby, conceptual flexibility in biological thinking. More generally, they highlight important linkages between domain-specific knowledge and domain-general cognitive abilities.

        - study 1

            - participants: 103 k-6 students in ~2000, from urban (n=55) and rural communities (n=49) in the US northeast

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F-Vz1fdkun6.png?alt=media&token=804e2cfc-0650-40a9-b700-bf18b89a0df1) (p. 5)

            - task: sort cards of species on a table, then explain why they formed each group

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FUnzrncGGBJ.png?alt=media&token=ce94a518-bc80-474a-8c44-64f97d0f7017)

            - measure: groupings (n taxonomic pairs, n ecological pairs, and then percentage). **taxonomic** = two species from same taxonomic category (e.g., woodchuck-beaver, fern-milkweed), **ecological** = two species from same ecological category (e.g., loon-dragonfly, firefly-paper-birch)

            - measure: explanations for groupings. transcribed and coded by ~3-4 coders using [[m/constant comparative method]]. disagreements (reported as rare) resolved via discussion. not mutually exclusive - 1) taxonomic explanations, 2) ecological explanations, 3) appearance explanations, and other

        - study 2:

            - participants:

            - measure: conceptual flexibility = change in percentage of taxonomic vs. ecological pairs and explanations from a general card sort to a "triadic" sort that focused on either taxonomic or ecological properties (shared internal features vs. shared environmental interaction)

        - they care about *conceptual flexibility* - ability to switch between taxonomic and ecological construals of living things

            - one axis: taxonomic vs. ecological construals

                - taxonomic = grouping living things based on shared morphological / intrinsic features, or common parents (is-a)

                - this seems to be grounded here intuitively, rather than formally, though it roughly seems to map to [[entity categories]] (taxonomic) vs. [[relational categories]] (ecological) cc [[@gentnerRelationalCategories2005]], and reminds me of [[schema-driven analogizing]]: expert-novice stuff on how sources are selected, in particular "[[schema-driven analogizing]]" from experts (vs. case-driven from novices) [[@ballSpontaneousAnalogisingEngineering2004]]

        - oh weird, ppl used to think that thematic comes first (is easier, less "sophisticated), and then later taxonomic (more abstract). this seems like.... first-principles thinking as the main thing???

- Pick back up [[@betzDevelopmentConceptualFlexibility2020]]

    - Some scratch thoughts on this - I continue to think that there is immense missed opportunity for CST community to connect with other domains like science ed, which is really about developing flexible, transferable knowledge - at least the "good ones" :)

        - See, e.g., [[John D. Coley]]

                - super cool, noticed that he's in the line of [[Douglas Medin]], the OG category guy

                    - see recent profile in [[@mossmanProfileDouglasMedin2007]]

    - Circling back up to the [[[[THE]] - interaction-oriented theory of creative inspiration from examples]], and modeling in particular, this line of work really hits on the role of **culture** in shaping conceptual categories, but really... connecting it to our setting, we can think about "what kind of experiences with examples" are folks getting in some cultures but not others? There's a common theme about unstructured, self-directed, contextualized interactions with examples (species, etc.) that will then form categories, and how that relates to being richer (causal, ecological) and more flexible knowledge structures that can then lead to more flexible and powerful *use* in novel situations. JUST LIKE WHAT WE WANT TO DO FOR CREATIVE TASKS! This is not just "learning", this is "learning --> acquire flexible knowledge base that I can use to do cool things I care about, which is after all, the whole thing about learning isn't it????"

    - map notes to [[Cedric Chin]]: map notes: this line of work is extraordinarily rich. last author (advisor/PI) is [[John D. Coley]], who's cited a lot in the piece, so it caught my attention as a program of research - i go to look up his google scholar profile and notice he's co-authored with [[Douglas Medin]] as equal (not in grad student position). amazing implications for cultural experiences (unstructured, in context) with cases to enhance conceptual flexibility, connects to deep roots in big shift in psych away from concepts as things with necessary and sufficient conditions, to family resemblances and contextual theories (like [[Wittgenstein]]!!! [[meaning as use]]!). super neat. i'm increasingly sensing a huge missed opportunity on the tools for thought side, ignoring this line of research as "just stodgy cognitive science" or "just about kids learning in schools"

[[March 15th, 2022]]

- for [theory paper]([[[[THE]] - interaction-oriented theory of creative inspiration from examples]]): [[[[EVD]] - higher conceptual flexibility to classify organisms based on taxonomic and ecological relations if children were older, from more rural areas, and engaged in more unstructured interactions with organisms - [[@betzDevelopmentConceptualFlexibility2020]]]] is really about **goal-directed/integrated** interactions (unstructured != unstructured! it's really self-directed, through play) vs. imposed org from others

    - idea then: interfaces that allow for self-imposed, *goal-directed* classification and remodeling according to constraints of task, are far better for modeling than interfaces that enable self-imposed classification, but not integrated into the goal-directed work (e.g., organize beforehand, but not during task), or are classified by others (i'm think actually that this latter one is really how most scholarly comm interfaces are!)

    - this connects back to finding of network differences between montessori and "regular" kids from that paper from [[Roger E. Beaty]]: [[[[EVD]] - estimated semantic networks of animal concepts from montessori-educated children were more interconnected, with shorter paths between concepts and fewer subcommunities, compared to networks from traditional-schooled but comparable children - [[@denervaudEducationShapesStructure2021]]]]

        - uses this [[m/Triangulated Maximally Filtered Graph (TMFG)]] method for estimating a network. it's a bit strange, but seems.... useful? roots in big data. lots of usage by [[Yoed N. Kenett]] and friends
