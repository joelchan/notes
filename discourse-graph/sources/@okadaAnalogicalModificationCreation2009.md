        - Abstract

            - The goal of this study was to propose a framework to describe the analogical process in the context of creation. We conducted ret- rospective interviews with two contemporary artists in their forties using portfolios of their past works so that they could recall their creation processes in detail. We found that the artists often use analogical modification to produce new series of artwork. Analogical modification is a cognitive process used to generate a new target, in the context of creation, by changing values of a source to make differences during analogical mapping. We found three types of analogical modification, namely, subject modification, structure modi- fication, and concept modification. Creative vision, which is formed through many years of creative activity and consists of long-term intentions or goals for creation, plays an important role in guiding the use of analogical modification. The process of artistic creation can be better understood using the framework of the interaction between activities in different time spans, such as analogical modification and creative vision.

        - Study

            - Two studies of two contemporary artists, Shinji Ogawa and Kenji Sugiyama (procedures are the same), spanning ~3-4 years of observations, including ten interviews, each about 3h long, in the artists' studio, and recorded (they called this a "portfolio interview")

        - Results

            - [[[[EVD]] - Two artists used individual artworks to shape not just their ideas, but used a process of "analogical modification" to search for and modify higher-order concepts, and their creative vision. This process unfolded over the course of years. - [[@okadaAnalogicalModificationCreation2009]]]]
