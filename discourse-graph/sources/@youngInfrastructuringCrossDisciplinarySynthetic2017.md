- some of the stuff that [[Wayne Lutters]] worked on with the GLOBE project (cf. [[@youngInfrastructuringCrossDisciplinarySynthetic2017]]) would be great fodder for this: the idea of location (e.g., GPS coordinates) as context seems straightforward, but actually turned out to be anything but...

    - [[Katrina Fenlon]] also has related issues showing up in some of her archives projects

    - other sources

        - the GoPro data

        - [[Xin Qian]] thinks there might be some signal in the interviews we did from [[@qianOpeningBlackBox2020]]

- To be more specific: is there a way we can model and capture [[context]] snippets that target the nature / "production context" of evidence: details of the measurements that might turn out to be usefully generative (not necessarily the "type" of measurement or experiment), details of the context (e.g., [geography]([[@youngInfrastructuringCrossDisciplinarySynthetic2017]]), [culture]([[@henrichWeirdestPeopleWorld2010]]))

    - Distinct from levels of evidence, e.g., a fuzzy logic score, or an empirical support score, or a binary support/challenge relation
