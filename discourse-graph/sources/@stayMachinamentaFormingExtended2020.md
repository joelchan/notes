        - Abstract

            - undefined

    - #lit-context

        - be careful: a blog post, no details on methods

            - also [[sys/GPT-3]] is also closed (only a select few have access, so i can't try it myself)

            - [[[[EVD]] - given one set of objects from a few classic analogies such as solar system / atom, [[sys/GPT-3]] was able to complete the corresponding objects on the other side for a few examples - [[@stayMachinamentaFormingExtended2020]]]]
