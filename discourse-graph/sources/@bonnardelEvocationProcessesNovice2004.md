        - Abstract

            - Design activity occurs in many professions, ranging from technical to more artistic domains. Whatever the domain, it is a constant challenge for designers to introduce creativity in each design project they work on and minimize the tendency to repeat familiar design features. The goal of this paper is to present a cognitive approach to design problem solving as well as an experimental study. This study aims at determining whether creative ideas can be enhanced by the presentation of external sources of inspiration. In particular, we analyse the effect of the presentation of different kinds of sources ([intra- versus interdomain sources]([[analogy]]), which are presented as graphical representations or as verbal labels) according to the designers level of expertise (lay-designers versus professionals). Results show that it is possible to enhance evocation processes in design, but that it is dependent on both the nature of sources of inspiration and the designers level of expertise. Based on these results, we suggest ways for enhancing creative ideas in design tasks.

- [[@bonnardelImpactTechnologyCreativity2010]], also per scite, is a possible complication on this, in that they also compared novice and experienced designers, but also varied analogical distance (but actually the finding that scite picks up as disputing is from [[@bonnardelEvocationProcessesNovice2004]])

    - interestingly, they find for the experienced designers that creative performance is highest for somewhat near [analogies]([[analogy]]) (so-called near inter-domain, vs. intradomain or remote inter-domain stimuli), adding to positive support for [[[[CLM]] - There is a 'Sweet Spot' in Analogical Distance. Somewhat far analogies lead to better creative outcomes than very near or very far analogies]]

    - so this line of work is really important regarding [[design-by-analogy]] for [[D/Computational Analogy]]

    - they compared novice and experienced designers, and found a non-replication of fixation for novices, but a replication for experienced designers with [[near analogies]], but a reverse (expansive) effect with [[far analogies]]

    - these findings again are slightly stronger than [[@janssonDesignFixation1991]]'s due to methodological choices (larger N, better controls on measurement)

        - it complicates the story regarding type of stimuli, evokes back to discussion s of concrete vs. abstract examples from [[@wardStructuredImaginationRole1994]]
