        - Abstract

            - In a series of seven experiments we examined preschool childrens ability to learn and transfer across problems that shared a common underlying structure but differed in surface manifestations. The problems involved novel uses of familiar tools or simple biological themes such as mimicry as a method of defense. In the fust three studies, we examined childrens ability to learn to transfer after being exposed to a variety of transfer situations. Three-year-olds benefit from condi- tions that encourage them to reflect upon relational similarity; four-year-olds show a learning to learn effect without prompts to look for similarity. Both ages rapidly form a mind set to look for analogous solutions across problems. In Stud- ies 4 to 7, we looked at preschoolers learning from examples. When required to explain why an example is an illustration of a general theme, transfer to other instances of that theme is rapid, often occurring on the basis of only one example. Explanations and elaborations provided by the children, either spontaneously or in response to prompts, are much more effective at promoting transfer than those provided by an experimenter. The data are discussed in terms of explanation- or analysis-based models of both machine and human learning.
