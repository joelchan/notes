- basically can think of diff. combinations of methods and scope to go from MVP to full-blown multi-year ethnography style thing (think [[@hargadonTechnologyBrokeringInnovation1997]] or even [[@vertesiShapingScienceOrganizations2020]] level)

    - methods

        - semi-structured interviews, ideally contextual, guided tours. kinda like [[@luceroFramingAligningParadoxing2012]] and what we did with [[@morabitoManagingContextScholarly2021]]

        - think-alouds working through a problem

        - observations/recordings of collaborative discussions

        - traces of artifacts: notes, drafts, published works, etc.

        - immersion in 1+ projects over period of time, tying these together

        - intervention / participatory action research: follow a team both before (baseline) and during and after deployment and change: this is what excites me the most: observe infrastructural change in motion!!!!!!!!!

    - scope

        - tools

        - stages in lifecycle

        - personal vs. collaborative

        - number of projects
