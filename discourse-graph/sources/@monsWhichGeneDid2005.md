        - correctly diagnoses that writing in a formal way (e.g., linking to established [[ontologies]]) is overly burdensome for authors BUT! still proposes that authors do a more lightweight version of it, with computer assistance

- another commentary in [[bioinformatics]] on how we can't expect authors of papers to write in formal ways. I like hte phrase, too, #> "why bury it first and then mine it again?", as a way to be skeptical of post-hoc text mining as the main thing to do. #[[@monsWhichGeneDid2005]]
