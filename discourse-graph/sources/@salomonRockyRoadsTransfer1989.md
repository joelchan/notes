            - Abstract

                - Recent findings of transfer and nontransfer in such areas as planning and problem management skills, computer programming instruction, and literacy- related cognitive skills reveal paradoxes that invite explanation. In this article, we separate the "how" of transfer- the mechanisms that lead to it -from the "what" of transfer-the kind of knowledge and skill that might get trans- ferred. We argue that transfer occurs in two ways. Low-road transfer depends on extensive, varied practice and occurs by the automatic triggerihg of well-learneid behavior in a new context. High-road transfer occurs by inten- tional imindful abstraction of something from one context and application in a new context. Such transfer can either be of the forward-reaching kind, whereby one mindfully abstracts basic elements in anticipation for later application, or of the backward-reaching kind, where one faces a new situation and deliberately searches for relevant knowledge already acquired. Findings of transfer or nontransfer reflect whether the conditions for leither low-road or high-road transfer were met. Qualitative predictions steyming from tihis theory of the mechanisms of transfer are offered and discussed.
