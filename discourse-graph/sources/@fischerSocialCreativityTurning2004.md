        - Abstract

            - Design is a ubiquitous activity. The complexity of design problems requires communities rather than individuals to address, frame, and solve them. These design communities have to cope with the following barriers: (1) spatial (across distance), (2) temporal (across time), (3) conceptual (across different communities of practice, and (4) technological (between persons and artifacts). Over the last decade, we have addressed these barriers and have tried to create socio-technical environments to turn them into opportunities for enhancing the social creativity of design communities.
