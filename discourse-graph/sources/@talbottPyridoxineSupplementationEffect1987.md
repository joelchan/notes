        - The results of this study indicate that PN supplementation improves lymphocyte function in healthy elderly persons

            - #implies vitamin [[B6]] nutriture is important in stimulating immunocompetence in the elderly.

        - #Claim [[PN supplementation]] #increase both [[T-cell mitogen]] and [[B-cell mitogen]] #[[response]]s

            - particularly in individuals with initially low plasma PLP levels.

            - #implies improved vitamin B-6 nutriture in elderly persons may improve in vivo cell-mediated and humoral immunity, especially in those with poor vitamin B-6

        - key #figure
