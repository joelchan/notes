        - Introduces the [[Learning Loop Complex]] and idea of [[encodon]] as bridge between data and representations ([[Schema]]s)that are then used for downstream tasks during [[🧱 sensemaking]] (p. 271)

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FLdc6dvd3SX?alt=media&token=daba4a52-0c6f-4ab8-b781-ede3d49e4558)

        - Also analyzes the [[🧱 cost structure]] of [[🧱 sensemaking]] and uses that to identify the most impactful ways to ease the process of sensemaking (in their case, it was data extraction)

            - They find that, for the cases they study, extracting data is the most costly step for [[🧱 sensemaking]] (p.273).

                - This is very similar to the idea of the challenges to sastifying #[[[[CLM]] - Composability is necessary for synthesis]], and evokes the same feeling as what happens in [[systematic review]]s, as [reported](#> The Data Extraction Process seemed particularly demanding to those involved in the corresponding tasks. The Coordinating Editor (P1) described [[systematic review]]ers as being "enslaved to the trapped data", with reviewers "chiseling the mine" to get at the data they needed. (p.208) #synthesis) by [[@knightEnslavedTrappedData2019]]
