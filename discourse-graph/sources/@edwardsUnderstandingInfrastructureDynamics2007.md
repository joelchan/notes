    - #lit-context

        - report from [[NSF]] workshop on [[infrastructure]]; a bit focused on [[cyberinfrastructure]]

    - #[[üìù lit-notes]]

        - punch card data tabulators in the insurance industry, possible bc of organizational changes within the industry (Yates, 1989)

            - #example-of [[[[CLM]] - Infrastructure is sociotechnical, not just technical]]

        - "people, routines, forms, and classification systems are as integral to information handling as computers, Ethernet cables, and Web protocols" (p. 3)

        - "smooth functioning" is central to the experience of and #definition of [[infrastructure]]

        - has a nice figure that places [[@starStepsEcologyInfrastructure1996]]'s dimensions of [[infrastructure]] on axes of local/global and social/technical

        - [[[[PTN]] - Prefer to grow rather than "build / design" new infrastructures a priori]]

            - "Speaking of cyberinfrastructure as a machine to be built or a technical system to be designed tends to downplay the importance of social, institutional, organizational, legal, cultural, and other non-technical problems developers always face...Hence this report turns away from a language of design and engineering, reframing the discussion in a more organic lexicon." (p. 7)

            - "Since infrastructures are incremental and modular, they are always constructed in many places (the local), combined and recombined (the modular), and they take on new meaning in both different times and spaces (the contextual). Better, then, to deploy a vocabulary of "growing", "fostering", or "encouraging" in the evolutionary sense when analyzing cyberinfrastructure." (p. 7)
