    - #lit-context

        - report from [[NSF]] workshop on [[infrastructure]]; a bit focused on [[cyberinfrastructure]]

    - #[[üìù lit-notes]]

        - punch card data tabulators in the insurance industry, possible bc of organizational changes within the industry (Yates, 1989)

            - #example-of [[[[CLM]] - Infrastructure is sociotechnical, not just technical]]

        - "people, routines, forms, and classification systems are as integral to information handling as computers, Ethernet cables, and Web protocols" (p. 3)

        - "smooth functioning" is central to the experience of and #definition of [[infrastructure]]

        - has a nice figure that places [[@starStepsEcologyInfrastructure1996]]'s dimensions of [[infrastructure]] on axes of local/global and social/technical

        - [[[[PTN]] - Prefer to grow rather than "build / design" new infrastructures a priori]]

            - "Speaking of cyberinfrastructure as a machine to be built or a technical system to be designed tends to downplay the importance of social, institutional, organizational, legal, cultural, and other non-technical problems developers always face...Hence this report turns away from a language of design and engineering, reframing the discussion in a more organic lexicon." (p. 7)

            - "Since infrastructures are incremental and modular, they are always constructed in many places (the local), combined and recombined (the modular), and they take on new meaning in both different times and spaces (the contextual). Better, then, to deploy a vocabulary of "growing", "fostering", or "encouraging" in the evolutionary sense when analyzing cyberinfrastructure." (p. 7)

- Also [[@edwardsUnderstandingInfrastructureDynamics2007]]. These are foundational papers.

    - for this one, learning about the historical dynamics of [[infrastructure]] (principally [[Hughes model of infrastructural development]]) development is very helpful for locating where [[D/Synthesis Infrastructure]] is on this trajectory

        - to start with, look at this def on p7

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F5MWI__L_oa.png?alt=media&token=c9ffcbbc-dcf1-4022-950b-d99d85d52320)

        - Mapping this to our context, we lack the locally constructed, centrally controlled systems for [[semantic publishing]]. At the same time, the technical infrastructure for linking these systems into networks and internetworks is fairly mature, including underlying open standards, repositories, and web protocols. One might even argue that these [[standards]] are mature enough to be considered ready to act as gateways for linking heterogeneous systems into networks through [[interoperability]].

        - Our project can be seen as focusing on developing these local systems for a small set of focused localities, and demonstrating some degree of technology transfer from one location to another, moving the needle forward closer towards [[infrastructure]]

        - A key question becomes what is meant by these "local systems". A partial clue comes from the paradigmatic #example-of this given by Hughes: the "lighting system" from Thomas Edison, which wasn't just hte lightbulb, but the whole system of generators, cables, and light bulbs that together delivered the __service__ of lighting.

            - Other examples:

                - personal computer as a data processing system: not just a CPU, but mass storage, input devices, outpu devices, plus training, software, etc.

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FiYrIjzmpJ6.png?alt=media&token=4ca3c671-f6f5-47d5-bfa5-8d8b612c01c4) (p. 8)

        - A key idea here is that it's more than just a single tool. Mapping this to our setting,  the system would be more than just a PDF reader, for example, but also the enhanced [[[[PTN]] - flexible compression]] system that glues the reader to a writing / note-taking interface, and integrates with a system for conversing with others (e.g., a Slack or Gmail plugin)

- Reading again this quote in #[[@edwardsUnderstandingInfrastructureDynamics2007]] while thinking about #[[[[PTN]] - Prefer to accrete new infrastructures on top of existing ones]] - I think the moment we are in for #[[D/Synthesis Infrastructure]] is somewhere in the [[gateway phase of infrastructure growth]]

    - ((wnYrcu9lY))

    - We have lots of useful systems (e.g., [[hypertext notebooks]], [[[[QUE]] - Do scholarly synthesis infrastructures already exist?]]), but there isn't really yet any critical mass of linking them, at least in the sense of the [[scholar-powered model of semantic publishing]]

    - "people, routines, forms, and classification systems are as integral to information handling as computers, Ethernet cables, and Web protocols" (p. 3)
