- New: [[literature-based discovery]], quite a few #example-of in [[@smalheiserRediscoveringDonSwanson2017]]

    - these caveats are of particular interest to us

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FyDXguk2Ea9.png?alt=media&token=7b751eef-92a1-43d1-9a7c-16541df79d2a) (p. 54)

        - need to scope down the A-literatures, often to within a field/domain (e.g., drugs)

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FeUeKakADt4.png?alt=media&token=53b6a94e-2d50-4f29-9776-aa673d5e9a40) (p. 51)

        - most [[literature-based discovery]] research has focused on quite narrow situations, not more complex boundary-spanning linkages

        - strong need to filter down the candidate literatures, bc they require extensive manual assessment

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FeUeKakADt4.png?alt=media&token=53b6a94e-2d50-4f29-9776-aa673d5e9a40) (p. 51)

    - concrete examples of discoveries/hypotheses that resulted from LBD methods

        - classics from [[Don R. Swanson]], which are of the [[one-node LBD search]] form, I want to solve/understand C, what ideas from A literatures might I connect to C, via implicit features B (e.g., common terms shared by A and C)

            - fish oil --> Raynaud's disease (I believe this is from [[@swansonFishOilRaynaud1986]])

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FoVaBOF7jZ-.png?alt=media&token=959b3bd0-8d39-4a1d-a7f3-838012de2d6a) (p. 47)

            - magnesium --> migraines

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2Fl_w2AzCRFS.png?alt=media&token=5faa3bc1-adff-437c-8e1c-836871a9bc60) (p. 48)

            - atrial fibrillation and running

                - interesting anecdote: [[Don R. Swanson]] experienced all of these conditions himself: this was not theoretical!

                    - reminds me very much of [[Martine Rothblatt]]'s [search for undiscovered cures](How did Martine start a biotechnology company to save the life of one of her daughters in spite of only having taken biology in high school? What did it take to even comprehend the scope of such an endeavor, and what was the journey that made it a reality? [15:33]) for her daughter's pulmonary hypertension issues [[@ferrissDrMartineRothblatt]]

        - examples of [[two-node LBD search]], which is substantially simpler: you fix A and C, and want to "fill out" the middle with a proposed mechanism (e.g., fish oil (A) --> Raynaud's disease (C) VIA (C))

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F4ho7zAk_-J.png?alt=media&token=067906cc-92e7-490d-9c73-c1201cfe3f48) (p. 53)

    - and [[@kostoffLiteraturerelatedDiscovery2009]] Is a bit pessimistic on the true value gained from this approach: questions whether the ~6-7 examples proposed by [[Don R. Swanson]] ([[@swansonUndiscoveredPublicKnowledge1996]]) were actually discoveries!
[[March 25th, 2021]]

- some recent papers on [[literature-based discovery]], including [[@smalheiserRediscoveringDonSwanson2017]], are published in the Journal of Data and Information Science, which used to be an international journal, traditionally "less prestigious"... - wondering how this is juxtaposed with frustrations in the metascience/reform community about the tabloid nature of prestigious outlets like Cell, Nature, Science, PNAS, Psych Science, etc.

    - but there are serious conerns here!! see, e.g., this paper [[@kostoffUnderreportingAdverseEvents2016]] had a 5-day lag between submission and acceptance????
