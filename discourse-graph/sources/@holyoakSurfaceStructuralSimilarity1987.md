- Title:: Surface and structural similarity in analogical transfer
- Author(s):: [[K. J. Holyoak]], [[K. Koh]]
- Abstract:: Two experiments investigated factors that influence the retrieval and use of analogies in problem solving. Experiment 1 demonstrated substantial spontaneous analogical transfer with a delay of several days between presentation of the source and target analogues. Experiment 2 examined the influence of different types of similarity between the analogues. A mechanism for retrieval of source analogues is proposed, based on summation of activation from features shared with a target problem. The results of Experiment 2 indicated that both structural features, which play a causal role in determining possible problem solutions, and salient surface features, which do not have a causal role, influence spontaneous selection of an analogue. Structural features, however, have a greater impact than do surface features on a problem solver's ability to use an analogue once its relevance has been pointed out.
