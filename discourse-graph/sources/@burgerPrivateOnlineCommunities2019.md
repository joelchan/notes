- There might be a niche opportunity for libraries to switch from "broadcast" social media strategies to cultivating and connecting with online communities. [[@burgerPrivateOnlineCommunities2019]] makes observations that resonate with what [[Zahra Farhadi]] is seeing: lots of broadcasting, basically zero presence in online communities. #[[P: Playbook + toolkit for libraries to connect with existing online communities for small businesses]]

    - Brainstorming more on this thread

        - Should talk to [[Victoria Van Hyning]] - ways for the libraries to step outside of its walls and build community.

        - Note: our goal isn't necessarily to develop our own online communities (building and growing your own online community is **hard**!!!), but to build community *through* potentially existing online communities
