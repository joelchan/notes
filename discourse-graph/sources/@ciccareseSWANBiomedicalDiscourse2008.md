    - which is a heroic #example-of [[specialized [[curator]] model of semantic publishing]]

- the next is [[std/SWAN]] [[@ciccareseSWANBiomedicalDiscourse2008]], which is a direct predecessor of [[std/Micropublication]]s (same key authors: [[Tim Clark]] and [[Paolo Ciccarese]])

    - [[discourse elements]] are at the heart of the ontology: they are composed of research questions, hypotheses, claims, and evidence

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F_ulWmpVLzq.png?alt=media&token=933aee12-8247-40ff-b5b8-2dc534bb6cb6) (p. 745)

    - here is an example in actual use, focusing on arbitration of conflicting claims

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FyV6OUclhOy.png?alt=media&token=0248ed0f-2489-4d1e-8b2c-2166c82f25de)

    - the key improvement of [[std/Micropublication]]s and [[std/SEPIO]] over this model is that **evidence is made a first-class object, alongside generalized claims**, rather than "bottoming out" in a citation (see also the importance of `observation notes` and `context snippets` in my model)

    - [[std/SWAN]] was actually instantiated in a working system, and was supposed to connect to [[sys/Alzforum]] (see [[@clarkAlzforumSWANPresent2007]])

        - But... I can't see a trace of it in the current [[sys/Alzforum]] website (e.g., would expect it to be listed somehow in their [list of databases](https://www.alzforum.org/databases), but it's not), even though it's still active, and there is active sharing and discussion of papers. What gives?

        - As far as I can tell, they did implement it

            - See, e.g., this screenshot of the pilot interface

        - The motivation is remarkably similar to what we are talking about: retaining the [[context]] of sensemaking, zeroing on the things we actually care about (the **semantics**)

        - They even think about a [[federation]] approach!!!!!! MySWAN, connecting together into a community SWAN!!!!!
