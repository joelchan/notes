    - i think the flip side here is to note the equality in skill of engagement that pushes back against assumptions that they wouldn't be able to speak for themselves (e.g., [[[[CL]] - There is a tension between analyzing participants' direct inputs, and respecting their actual insights (vs. designers' interpretation) that is intensified when working with design partners who struggle to contribute more directly to design artifacts]])

    - not typical PD

    - how the communities used ICTs to influence policy/governance

    - one big takeaway: ICTs not great equalizer: access (through ICT) != access (to levers of power)

    - "digital receipt" was powerful mechanism for accountability

    - [[Elizabeth Bonsignore]]: "I intimidated them!"
