    - Key ideas:

        - [[paradigmatic relevance]] is an important and distinct notion of relevance (compared to [[Topical Relevance]]) in scholarly information seeking (p. 676)

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FU9qtg2BxYc?alt=media&token=70f344e8-d8c9-4ec1-83f3-82f47b57223c)

            - Some kinds of information seeking strategies are better fits for [[paradigmatic relevance]]

                - #Claim Subject headings and keyword searches are more effective for domains with high [[Topical Relevance]]; in domains characterized more by [[paradigmatic relevance]], these stragies are less useful, and other strategies like [[chaining]] or [[Browsing]] are more powerful. (p. 683)

                    - Similar result to [[@batesSpeculationsBrowsingDirected2002]]'s hypothesized advantage of [[chaining]] in high-[[Scatter]] domains

            - Potentially related to idea of the degree of [[Scatter]] in a domain

        - Tricky to draw boundaries around what we mean by [[Domain]], but it's supposed to be above an individual scholar, and includes some the scholar's [[context]], but more granular than a "field"

        - One interesting finding re: field size (contra [[R: bates2002speculations]])

###### Discourse Context

- **Informs::** [[CLM - In interdisciplinary domains, network-based foraging is more powerful than search-based foraging]]

- [[@taljaReasonsUseNon2003]] talking about [[Domain-Analysis]] approach to understanding scholars' information needs: one systematic area of variation is the degree to which a domain is topical (we agree on what the objects are) vs. paradigmatic (diff. schools of thoughts to define what the objects are), which has implications for how people search for things (topics/keywords/subject headings not as useful for paradigmatic-relevance domains; there, they use much more browsing and chaining)

    - Probably [[interdisciplinarity]] #increase the degree to which relevance is paradigmatic vs. topical?

    - Discussed also in [[@fisherTheoriesInformationBehavior2005]]

- Domains vary substantially in what knowledge is considered "relevant", with very pragmatic implications for what kinds of information retrieval (and synthesis) tools should be designed (this is the idea of [[paradigmatic relevance]],. for example) [[@hjorlandEpistemologySociocognitivePerspective2002]] [[@taljaReasonsUseNon2003]]

    - Disciplines have deep-rooted and consequential differences in what counts as "relevant" information. Some are characterized by [[paradigmatic relevance]], where the meaning of terms, and what therefore counts as relevant results for that term, vary substantially by "school of thought". #Relevance

        - This has implications for reuse too I think, in [[synthesis]]: need to hold together varying conceptions of what makes something "relevant" and "reusable" (compounding the issues with [[context]] from [[CSCW]])

            - {{embed: [[[[CLM]] - Specifying context for future reuse is costly]]}}

    - This line of work in general seems more focused on information seeking ([[üß± foraging]]), a lot less on [[synthesis]]
