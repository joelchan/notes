        - Abstract

            - . The internet is rapidly becoming the first place for researchers to publish documents, but at present they receive little support in searching, tracking, analysing or debating concepts in a literature from scholarly perspectives. This paper describes the design rationale and implementation of ScholOnto, an ontology-based digital library server to support scholarly interpretation and discourse. It enables researchers to describe and debate via a semantic network the contributions a document makes, and its relationship to the literature. The paper discusses the computational services that an ontology-based server supports, alternative user interfaces to support interaction with a large semantic network, usability issues associated with knowledge formalisation, new work practices that could emerge, and related work.

###### Discourse Context

- **Informs::** [[CLM - Scholarly argumentation operates on atomic statements and concepts as fundamental units]]

    - also has something to say about the badness of [[[[CLM]] - Most scholarly communication infrastructure operates on the document as the base unit]] (vs. [[[[CLM]] - Scholarly argumentation operates on atomic statements and concepts as fundamental units]])
