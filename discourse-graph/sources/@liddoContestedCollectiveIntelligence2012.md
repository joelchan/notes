        - TL;DR: introduces idea of [[contested collective intelligence]] and describes [[Sys: Cohere]] system as a potential solution

        - overall model is a [[Mixed-Initiative]] approach that combines machine and human [[annotation]]s over source documents and then composing them into networks of ideas p. 425
