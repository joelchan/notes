- [[@thegeneralistIndieResearcher2020]] discussion amongst [indie researchers]([[independent researchers]]) like [[Andy Matuschak]] and [[Adam Wiggins]] (of [[org/Ink and Switch]], who made [[sys/Muse]]) that gives insight into the [problems with academic science and research]([[[[CLM]] - Prevailing incentives in academia are bad for science]])

    - I can articulate now one reason I'm fascinated with that scene: in some ways, their work represents research and the pursuit of insight in its purest form, unadulterated by careerism (how am I going to get more pubs, how am I going to get promoted, get more grants, rewards, etc.), because they're not in a system that links their work to those incentives. That is how it should be in academia, but my experience is that I'm swimming **against** these currents to do the work I feel needs to be done.
