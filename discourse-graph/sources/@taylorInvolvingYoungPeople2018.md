- Abstract:: Young people with cancer are often described as ‘hard to reach’, ‘difficult to engage’ and/or ‘vulnerable’. Consequently, they are often over looked for patient and public involvement activities. We set out to involve young people with cancer to work as co-researchers in the design of the largest ever study of young people with cancer, called BRIGHTLIGHT. In the 10 years since the BRIGHTLIGHT feasibility work began we have involved more than 1200 young people as co-researchers, collaborators, consultants and dissemination partners. We chronicle the key points of this 10-year journey, sharing our success, describing our challenges and the solutions we put in place; sharing also what worked and did not work. Here we share some of these experiences of involving young people in this research and offer some practical advice for those looking to do the same.

- [[@taylorInvolvingYoungPeople2018]] "in their 2018 evaluation of young cancer patients as co-research and collaborators, Taylor et al stated, “one of our early challenges was the lack of published guidance or examples of PPIE (patient and public involvement and engagement) in research, particularly when working with young people.” It is important to note though this was stated, additional details around this observation were not provided by the authors."
