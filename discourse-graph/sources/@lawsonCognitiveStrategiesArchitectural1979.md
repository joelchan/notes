        - methods

            - task: arrange different-shaped blocks to maximize showing one of two colors, but respecting some constraints on acceptability regarding block combinations, which are unknown (and can only be inferred from yes/no answers from oracle about a solution)

                - v similar to classic concept learning tasks

            - measures

                - planning errors vs. structural errors: roughly, planning errors are about "execution" (you have all the pieces, you need to get the design right); and structural errors are about "understanding" (you have a pretty good design, but you're breaking one or more fundamental rule, you need to get the right design)

                - scores across the different problem types

            - [[participants]]:

                - fifth-year undergrad science or architecture majors (experts)

                - first-year undergrad science or architecture majors (novices)

        - results

            - [[[[EVD]] - science students made more planning errors and fewer structural errors on a spatial block design task; architecture students made fewer planning errors and more structural errors - [[@lawsonCognitiveStrategiesArchitectural1979]]]]

                - architecture students performed worse than science students on problem variants that relied on having a good grasp of the rule (disjunction rules)

                - inferred from this that there is a contrast between "designerly" and "scientific" approach: [designers are solution-oriented]([[[[CLM]] - Expert designers are solution-oriented]]) (find solutions that work), scientists are problem oriented (try to discover structure of the problem)
