    - #Claim Engineering and design principles for [[FATML]] systems that are trustworthy need to be based not just on formal properties of the ML systems, but also on community experience

- Kernel of idea: from recent {{alias: [[@nationalscienceandtechnologycouncilArtificialIntelligenceCybersecurity2020]]NSF workshop on AI and Cybersecurity }} (March 2020): #Claim Engineering and design principles for [[FATML]] systems that are trustworthy need to be based not just on formal properties of the ML systems, but also on community experience

    - Therefore, some kind of community deliberation is essential. But how can this work when there is a large gaping chasm in knowledge about the properties of the objects being designed (and their environments and constraints)? This goes both from the community to the ML experts (need [[P/Material Knowledge of ML for Design]]), but also from the ML experts to the community (need [[metis]])
