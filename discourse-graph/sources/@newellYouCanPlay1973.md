    - #> from [[Jean Piaget]] in preface to [[@gruberDarwinManPsychological1974]] #> : ‚Äúa new scientific theory differs from a simple ‚Äúreading‚Äù or description of the observed or observable facts‚Äù (p. vii)

        - follow up #> ‚Äúthe construction of a new theory is far from being reducible to the accumulation of data, but necessitates an extremely complex ^^structuring^^ of interpretive ideas which are ^^linked^^ to ^^the facts^^ and which enrich them by framing them in a ^^context^^‚Äù

- If only at data level, hard to see the forest for the trees. Gets overwhelming. [[@newellYouCanPlay1973]]

    - [[@jonasCouldNeuroscientistUnderstand2017]] is a particularly fun thought experiment++ on the insufficiency of a purely data-driven approach. ((On the flip side, the "empirical turn" in philosophy is evidence of the insufficiency of a purely theory-driven approach))

- On the other hand, theory-free mining of data patterns cannot lead to the depth of understanding needed to explain and solve difficult real-world problems ([[@newellYouCanPlay1973]], [[@katzHowPlay202018]], [[@jonasCouldNeuroscientistUnderstand2017]], [[@vanrooijTheoryTestHow2021]], [[@marderTheoreticalMusings2020]]). This is because observations are inherently driven by our theories, which can often preclude observing the very data needed to construct powerful new theories [[@popperLogicScientificDiscovery1959]]; further, the space of possible theories is typically severely underdetermined by data.
