            - Abstract

                - This chapter is concerned with the acquisition and use of [[relational categories]]. By relational category, we mean a category whose membership is determined by a common relational structure rather than by common properties. Relational categories contrast with [[entity categories]] such as tulip or camel, whose members share many intrinsic properties. Relational categories cohere on the basis of a core relationship fulfilled by all members. This chapter explores the contrast between relational and entity categories, relational structure in ordinary categories, similarity- and theory-based accounts of conceptual structure, criteria and rules in relational categories, and the distinction between coherence- and correspondence-based concepts.
