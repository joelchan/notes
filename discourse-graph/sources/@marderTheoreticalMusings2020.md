        - Abstract

            - There is more to theory in biology than replicating the results of experiments â€“ the best theory papers help experimentalists to identify which of their results might be general and to plan a path through the maze of all possible future experiments.

- [[@marderTheoreticalMusings2020]] leads to wonderful rabbit-hole and find of this paper that does a "worked example" of how to better interleave theory and data in papers: [[@goldsteinAreTheoreticalResults2018]]

    - and also reflecting on the aberrant emphasis on data > theory in bio

        - maybe fits with stuff that [[Matthew Akamatsu]] has been saying about the undervaluing of [[synthesis]] in his field

    - talks about the need for the [[dialectic]] [[dance between the theoretical and the evidential]] that is foundational to the scientific method

- On the other hand, theory-free mining of data patterns cannot lead to the depth of understanding needed to explain and solve difficult real-world problems ([[@newellYouCanPlay1973]], [[@katzHowPlay202018]], [[@jonasCouldNeuroscientistUnderstand2017]], [[@vanrooijTheoryTestHow2021]], [[@marderTheoreticalMusings2020]]). This is because observations are inherently driven by our theories, which can often preclude observing the very data needed to construct powerful new theories [[@popperLogicScientificDiscovery1959]]; further, the space of possible theories is typically severely underdetermined by data.
