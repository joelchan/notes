    - it's a case description (not formal academic) from [[IDEO]], illustrating how "analogous research" works, to help with problem reformulation

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FzVSHGBo3lX.png?alt=media&token=7429a5dd-5c4a-4463-9423-bd16376dbf65)

    - the case starting point is a hospital that wans to redesign the entire patient experience (super broad)

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F1S2czKyJ5I.png?alt=media&token=10aa6270-2c28-486e-a05d-47d8939cef8a)

    - they went to an airport for inspiration, to see what solutions and problems were there, based on a shared mapping of complexity of the experience, and a sense that this industry had invested in solutions to make it better (I am... personally doubtful? :P)

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FpRCmLLzPus.png?alt=media&token=5ef35b18-8897-4b3c-a588-af8c9ff9ff43)

    - what they noticed:

        - many different pathways for customers; in contrast to "one option" for their patients

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2Fc9qZnFjVSJ.png?alt=media&token=f6ce843e-fcbe-4556-8ded-c378053900d9)

        - customer service desk; a place to also go beyond the standard job description

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FZLcue5z0Ak.png?alt=media&token=a23503f5-a54f-4359-bb1a-4adf599d7412)

    - which led to ideas for prototypes to test

    - this case is evocative on the surface as an example (hospitals and airports!), but maybe isn't super insightful in the details. i particularly wish i had a better sense of where the problem formulations *started*; i can see from the examples where the problem formulations were *missing*, i guess, but i'm not sure if the problem to start with was too... high level?

    - what i'm noticing about this case:

        - how interleaved problems and solutions are... this feels important.

        - the immersive nature of the experience; it was embodied, not abstract; this kind of gets back to what [[AJ Rudd Jr]] is exploring

    - still, useful to reify this as a case/example: [[[[EVD]] - hospital workers reformulated the problem of designing a better patient experience based on insights from exploring an analogous setting of customer experience in airports - [[@cassTransformYourIndustry2019]]]]

- Riffing on [[@cassTransformYourIndustry2019]] and other stuff about problem reformulation, what's important is to be able to see not just the problematic situation, but to see something in action... a design move in action.

    - If I just say, "ok, well X is doing something similar too", that's not as interesting as "X in general seems like it's related, let's look at Y in X"
