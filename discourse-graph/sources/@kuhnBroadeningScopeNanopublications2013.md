        - #Claim Natural-language nanopublications should be atomic, independent, declarative, and absolute #Atomicity

        - Vision of a [[synthesis]][[infrastructure]] that is similar to ours (p.492)

            - fictitious (yet easily recognizable) scenario that is an #example-of how scientists need to "fight" the [[scholarly communication]] [[infrastructure]] to find answers to their questions because [[[[CLM]] - Most scholarly communication infrastructure operates on the document as the base unit]]

        - has a user study that checks how easy it is to train 16 biomed researchers to convert a short text into a natural language statement (no [[formality]] though!)
