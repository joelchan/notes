            - POtentially gives some insight to #[[[[QUE]] - What is the user experience of semantic authoring within regular scholarly workflows?]]

- articulates the addition of richer [[context]] (through direct representation of empirical evidence), and [[composability]] (through the representation of claim networks) as a key advance over [[std/SWAN]], [[std/Nanopublications]], and [[std/BEL]] (the latter two in addition are limited by their requirements that statements be in formal language, although [[@kuhnBroadeningScopeNanopublications2013]] did modify the standard to support natural-language statements)
