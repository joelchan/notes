- [[Kexin Quan]]'s discourse graph on [[@frichMappingLandscapeCreativity2019]] was extremely well buil^. While I'm happy to see that my note-taking approach served as a starting point, I'm too ashamed to take credit. ^^To be honest, I was shocked when I saw **sections envisioned as questions** as it didn't even cross my mind!^^

    - The notes were very clear, precise and concise.

    - ^^I also appreciate how she used different tags! I didn't and now I feel there are plenty of ways I can connect the pieces of evidence and claims! Opened my mind, once again!^^
