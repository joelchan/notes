            - Abstract

                - In this paper the authors introduce, apply, and discuss a set of design artefacts called maps, intended to support design researchers in capturing, analysing, and reflecting upon design processes. The maps focus on reflection with regard to the role of sources of inspiration and design materials in the emergence and transformation of design ideas. The paper revolves around a specific case, the design of media facades i.e. displays that are an integrated part of a buildings facade as part of the development of material for a bid in an architectural competition for a new modern art museum in Warsaw, Poland. They discuss their findings from using the maps for design reflection in this case, with a particular focus on the importance of employing artefacts to support design reflection.
