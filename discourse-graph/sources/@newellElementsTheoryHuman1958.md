- in simon's theory of problem solving (many refs, but see, eg., [[@simonStructureIllStructured1973]]; canonical cite is [[@newellElementsTheoryHuman1958]], and later on, the book: [[@newellHumanProblemSolving1972]]), it's a [[problem space]], which consists of

    - similar in [[@goelStructureDesignProblem1992]]

    - states, which is like reward model / distribution of "good" solutions?

    - operators, which are basically space of possible moves

    - tests / goal, which distinguishes constraints / requirements

- As early back as [[@newellElementsTheoryHuman1958]], cognitive scientists began to model problem solving as search in a problem space.

    - Within general cognitive science, there are various N-space models

        - [[@klahrDualSpaceSearch1988]] extended the problem space model to account for scientific discovery as joint search in a space of hypotheses and a space of experiments.

    - Quite a few detailed experiments with specific problems (e.g., [[Tower of Hanoi]]) exploring aspects of problem representation

        - One interesting experiment is in [[@kotovskyWhatMakesProblems1990]], which identifies learning about what even constitutes a "move" as a key determinant of a problem's difficulty (in contrast to the size of the search space)
