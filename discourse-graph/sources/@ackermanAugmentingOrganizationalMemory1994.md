- Title:: Augmenting the organizational memory: a field study of answer garden
- Author(s):: [[Mark S. Ackerman]]
- Abstract:: A growing concern for organizations and groups has been to augment their knowledge and expertise. One such augmentation is to provide an organizational memory, some record of the organization's knowledge. However, relatively little is known about how computer systems might enhance organizational, group, or community memory. This paper presents findings from a field study of one such organizational memory system, the Answer Garden. The paper discusses the usage data and qualitative evaluations from the field study, and then draws a set of lessons for next-generation organizational memory systems.

    - Main findings for us:

        - 1/3 of the users reported that information in the database and/or provided by expert was sometimes too high or too low in terms of specificity and level of explanation

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FuzsPmkyair.png?alt=media&token=818bdfcd-b450-48d2-97cb-763a7887ecd4) (p. 249)

            - but we don't know anything about who these users are and what those questions are

        - design of anonymity maybe reduces status implications of asking for help

        - potential status implications from the expert information-provider from different org (maybe want to make things look more formal than they really are to keep an organizational "face")

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FZtQlRSgyOt.png?alt=media&token=656971b1-1a26-404e-98ac-d2c9f6dd04c9) (p. 245)

            - more formal than they really wanted

        - proof of concept that something like this could work and be sustained at least over the course of a semester-ish

        - proof of concept that integrating experts added some value for users to get answers they would otherwise find more difficult to get from the db alone (~20% of users reported getting answers to questions they otherwise wouldn't have been able to get)

    - can't tell us anything about expert incentives

    - Deployed over the course of ~20 weeks (but most data is from the first 14 weeks of usage)

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FNNOtBegJpP.png?alt=media&token=408c9250-9882-44a9-b230-e9412d03873a)

        - This is a major strength of this study

    - Majority of usage from 6 heavy users
