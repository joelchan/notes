        - Abstract

            - [Jansson and Smith]([[@janssonDesignFixation1991]]) (1991, “Design Fixation,” Des. Stud., 12(1), pp. 3–11) demonstrated that design fixation occurs when an example solution is provided along with a design problem. After seeing an example concept—even with its flaws pointed out—new designs often share its features. In Jansson and Smith’s studies, a control group saw no example and showed less fixation to the example provided only in the other group. However, another source of fixation from an initial example may arise in the control group from the designer’s own first-generated concept. We conducted a large-scale experiment with beginning engineers to investigate whether design fixation occurs even without seeing a provided example. Half of the participants saw an example solution and half were given no example; instead, they generated their own initial design. Next, all students were individually brainstormed ideas for 30 min. We analyzed both groups’ concepts for fixation on the first solution they saw—either the example provided or their own initial concept. The results showed that the students provided with an example concept experienced less fixation on the initial example than those in the control group, whose concepts were evaluated for similarity to their own initial concept. To consider whether fixation on initial examples (provided or self-generated) might be mitigated, we asked these students to complete a second (30 min) idea generation phase using Design Heuristics for idea inspiration. The results showed that both groups experienced less fixation during the second-generation phase. These findings suggest that fixation on first solutions occurs in individual idea generation arising from both provided examples and self-generated concepts. However, more divergent idea generation can be facilitated through the use of design tools, such as Design Heuristics, to mitigate the consequences of design fixation.

- per scite, [[@leahyDesignFixationInitial2020]], "Contrary to our hypothesis and the findings in [[@janssonDesignFixation1991]] and other studies, fixation on a provided example was less than that observed when students generated their own initial example"

    - this is an important study because it almost a direct replication of jansson, in that it uses the materials from experiment 1 ([the bike rack](task: design a car-mounted bicycle rack that is easy to mount (both rack and bike), doesn't damage bike or car, and versatile across cars and bikes. everyone was given an hour, and asked to construct as many designs as possible, comment and number the designs)) and experiment 3 ([the coffee cup](((wLEsG3chK)))), but with a substantially larger sample (~30 per cell, across the two problems, but in total ~60 per experimental condition, almost 4x the N of the original study)

    - in a sense, this doesn't invalidate the idea that [[[[CLM]] - Recent or concurrent exposure to ideas can substantially influence the direction of ideation]], so much as complicates it by noting that the effect is likely stronger for your *own* ideas (which makes sense!)

    - i don't think this is quite as much a dispute or non-replication of the original study as it sounds, since the main finding is a comparison to a self-generated example, which showed slightly stronger fixation levels.

        - key figure:

        - in absolute terms, the fixation rates are higher than the "control group" in [[@janssonDesignFixation1991]], but about half the rate of the fixation group

            - not unlike many studies where the effect size is smaller in a replication compared to a small sample. i trust the estimate from [[@leahyDesignFixationInitial2020]] more, given the enhanced precision in the measurement and experiment design.

            - in absolute terms, we are talking about a relatively small constriction of the design space - not a terribly large effect, but still something that might be significant in a pinch
