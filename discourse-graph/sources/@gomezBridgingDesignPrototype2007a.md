            - Abstract

                - This paper reports on studies where teachers from two different preschools incorporated a Bridging Design Prototype (BDP) for concept mapping into classroom activities. Designed under inclusive, participatory, and user-centered principles, the BDP was used to perform observations for assessing an interaction problem and refining the user community profile. The observation findings will inform next stage of product development.
