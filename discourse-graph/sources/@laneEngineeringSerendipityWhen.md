        - Abstract

            - Research Summary We investigate how knowledge similarity between two individuals is systematically related to the likelihood that a serendipitous encounter results in knowledge production. We conduct a field experiment at a medical research symposium, where we exogenously varied opportunities for face-to-face encounters among 15,817 scientist-pairs. Our data include direct observations of interaction patterns collected using sociometric badges, and detailed, longitudinal data of the scientists' postsymposium publication records over 6 years. We find that interacting scientists acquire more knowledge and coauthor 1.2 more papers when they share some overlapping interests, but cite each other's work between three and seven times less when they are from the same field. Our findings reveal both collaborative and competitive effects of knowledge similarity on knowledge production outcomes. Managerial Summary Managers often try to stimulate innovation by encouraging serendipitous interactions between employees, for example by using office space redesigns, conferences and similar events. Are such interventions effective? This article proposes that an effective encounter depends on the degree of common knowledge shared by the individuals. We find that scientists who attend the same conference are more likely to learn from each other and collaborate effectively when they have some common interests, but may view each other competitively when they work in the same field. Hence, when designing opportunities for face-to-face interactions, managers should consider knowledge similarity as a criteria for fostering more productive exchanges.

                - note: only 2% of the pairs fell into the "partial overlap" category for field similarity, and the majority of scientists (about 80%) had "low intellectual similarity" (i.e., ~2 common keywords or fewer)

- Want to specifically distinguish from endpoint of jump-starting collaborations, but instead ok with endpoint of success being learning or knowledge transfer, a la [[@laneEngineeringSerendipityWhen]]'s finding about [knowledge transfer effects from matched interactions](scientist pairs who were [randomly assigned to talk to each other](((Dvg9ncop6))) (and did so, face-to-face) at an [interdisciplinary medical imaging symposium](((HvQgkhAIF))) used about 6 new [MeSH keywords from their partners in future publications](((08vh79BF1))) when the pair had [moderate overlap in intellectual interests](((_eEx8ZIIv))), compared to low or high overlap (for which there were no clear effects))

[[January 18th, 2021]]

- Processing [[@laneEngineeringSerendipityWhen]] a bit more: it's probably a core paper for [[idea: sociotechnical analogical connector]]

    - We can learn from them about the **motivation** prerequisites for setting something up

        - in [[@laneEngineeringSerendipityWhen]], the motivator is applying for grants

    - But also the evidence that we can't just randomly assign people to talk to each other and expect great things to happen: too close, and they compete; too far, and nothing transfers.

        - This is a friction point where analogical matching might help

        - It's an open question whether additional scaffolding is needed

        - Key result

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FKTR1-seNZt.png?alt=media&token=df938a71-3209-45ec-be64-45b57bc64b30)

        - Need to unpack this more, but basically:

            - 3a: getting people to talk to each other has no detectable effect on knowledge transfer when they're far apart and very near, but a meaningful increase (~ 6 new MeSH keywords) in knowledge transfer after communicating with people with moderate (dis)similarity in field/intellectual interests

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F3iA33ut-L4.png?alt=media&token=a31b15b9-5b8a-4b49-9c32-0ea2aa88f206) (p. 16)

            - 3b and 3c: getting people to talk to each other who are close had *negative* effects on knowledge creation and knowledge similarity!

        - Still unclear whether the lack of benefits for low similarity pairs is a hard fact/constraint, or an artifact of lack of scaffolding. Keep an eye on this.

    - Some things I noticed:

        - It's very quant-heavy: the only thing they took out of the [[sociometrics]] sensors was binary measure of "did they have sustained face-to-face contact" - no insight into the nature of the conversations

            - maybe a touch more insight into that in this paper [[@baronSynthesisCentersCritical2017]] (and the literature it cites)

                - See especially the point about "active management"

                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FLObVjqpo7O.png?alt=media&token=d189ccc2-d59d-4107-8271-4dc7ff552b9d) (p. 755)

                - Ok, so:

                    - [[@palmerPracticesFacilitatingInterdisciplinary2016]] (not to be confused with [[Carole L. Palmer]]) talks about the importance of matchmaking for facilitating productive collaborations in a [[synthesis centers]], but there isn't a more precise quantitative argument, nor much detail on what works and what doesn't work

                        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FojPsmZVrkE.png?alt=media&token=f9e5f413-d32d-408e-842c-6ac7da948140) (p. 116)

                            - i'm curious how long it takes to do this "the usual way", and whether [[analogical search]] could augment this

                    - [[@lyallExperimentsInterdisciplinaryCapacitybuilding2013]] is an intro paper to a special issue on how to facilitate large-scale, long-term interdisciplinary collaborations

                        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FWuYWaQOAQ4.png?alt=media&token=f44a0090-d94a-4eab-bc91-757c008565a9) (p. 5)

                        - the papers have a case study flavor, so they might be worth looking into

    - In general, we need to be quite precise when diving into this lit, because the endpoints can vary quite a bit in ways that might be subtle yet impactful: there is probably a HUGE difference between facilitating a serendipitous (e.g., [[frontierfridays]], [[idea: sociotechnical analogical connector]]), relatively short encounter, vs. helping a team to form and storm and work well, vs. facilitating productive ongoing teams in a [[synthesis centers]]

        - These increase in levels of difficulty, but also in terms of the range of factors that need to be brought in, many of which may be independent of the core process we care about... which is...?

            - Something about a "spark" comes to mind.

            - We can't fully control what comes after, in terms of team formation, alignment of goals, etc.

            - But what [[analogy]] could do is help increase the success rate of teams that for other reasons would work well together, to get that initial spark of an idea

        - I think the antecedents are likely to be shared though...

    - #[[‚û∞ breadcrumbs]]

        - some past research on the difficulty of assimilating knowledge that is far from your expertise: be careful, though: note whether these are about an "organizational unit" as the unit of analysis, which might be quite different from a *person* as the unit of analysis (which is what we're focusing on, although organizational constraints might be in operation, and people might help to navigate these)

    - one result of interest: scientist pairs who were [randomly assigned to talk to each other](((Dvg9ncop6))) (and did so, face-to-face) at an [interdisciplinary medical imaging symposium](((HvQgkhAIF))) used about 6 new [MeSH keywords from their partners in future publications](((08vh79BF1))) when the pair had [moderate overlap in intellectual interests](((_eEx8ZIIv))), compared to low or high overlap (for which there were no clear effects)

        - note that the same result was *not* found for field similarity.

            - the way they conceptualized it, intellectual similarity seemed closer to [[analogy]], problem-focus, and field similarity seemed more akin to "surface similarity

                - this mapping isn't perfect, but i wonder if it's indirect evidence for

                    - [[[[CLM]] - There is a 'Sweet Spot' in Analogical Distance. Somewhat far analogies lead to better creative outcomes than very near or very far analogies]]

                    - [[[[CLM]] - Core attribute (mis)matches mediate the benefits of analogies in real-world, complex problem solving]]

        - the significance of this result, again, for us, is that, in addition to [[search costs of innovation]], even when people are brought together who might share common interests (at least on a broad level), with a substantial base incentive to explore and find collaborations (to the tune of [potentially $50k in seed funding](setting: 306 (out of 402) scientists participating in an interdisciplinary medical symposium for research on advanced imaging in [[2012]], in conjunction with seed grant opportunities (up to $50k per 15 grants) from the university's clinical and translational science center)), in many cases the interaction might not bear any discernible fruit!

            - note that the [core result on knowledge transfer](scientist pairs who were [randomly assigned to talk to each other](((Dvg9ncop6))) (and did so, face-to-face) at an [interdisciplinary medical imaging symposium](((HvQgkhAIF))) used about 6 new [MeSH keywords from their partners in future publications](((08vh79BF1))) when the pair had [moderate overlap in intellectual interests](((_eEx8ZIIv))), compared to low or high overlap (for which there were no clear effects)), for example, was for [less than 20% of the scientist pairs](((iLgnouiUw)))! so we can roughly say that the likelihood that a randomly paired interaction, even within a relatively shared [[communities of interest]], is probably less than a coin flip!

            - this suggests that there are substantial inefficiencies to address

            - and this indicator is relatively "light": no collaboration overhead required!

            - can we do better than this with [[analogical search]]?

        - suggests a good question to track: [[[[QUE]] - What is the range of expected "benefits" of engineered interactions with potential "informants" across knowledge boundaries?]]
[[QUE - What are the most efficient routes to useful cross-boundary knowledge]]

- For example, [[@laneEngineeringSerendipityWhen]] reported that scientist pairs who were [randomly assigned to talk to each other](((Dvg9ncop6))) (and did so, face-to-face) at an [interdisciplinary medical imaging symposium](((HvQgkhAIF))) used about 6 new [MeSH keywords from their partners in future publications](((08vh79BF1))) when the pair had [moderate overlap in intellectual interests](((_eEx8ZIIv))), compared to low or high overlap (for which there were no clear effects)

    - Caveats aside, this result suggests that the likelihood that a randomly paired interaction, even within a relatively shared [community of interest]([[communities of interest]]), and estimating effects on  a relatively "lightweight" outcome (i.e., evidence of [knowledge transfer](**knowledge sharing**, measured in part from random assignments, and in part from face to face interaction data from sociometric badges), instead of more costly endpoints like copublication), is probably less than a coin flip!

    - It's notable that the observed positive effects here were for estimated [less than 20% of the scientist pairs](note: only 2% of the pairs fell into the "partial overlap" category for field similarity, and the majority of scientists (about 80%) had "low intellectual similarity" (i.e., ~2 common keywords or fewer))!

    - And in some cases (e.g., when field similarity was high), there were [*dampening* effects on co-authorship in the 6 years following the symposium](scientist pairs who were [randomly assigned to talk to each other](((Dvg9ncop6))) (and did so, face-to face) at an [interdisciplinary medical imaging symposium](((HvQgkhAIF))) had *fewer* [co-authored publications with their partner after the symposium](((Dxba0prqe))) when the pair had [high field similarity](((_eEx8ZIIv))), compared to low or moderate overlap (for which there were no clear effects; maybe a slightly positive effect for moderately field-similar pairs, but the 95% confidence interval crosses zero)).

    - #appraisal - these results seem a bit fragile to me: they rest on interaction terms in relatively complex OLS models.

- RQ: extending of [[@laneEngineeringSerendipityWhen]] paper, would the [[analogical search engine]] be useful to recommend people from potential discipline to work on.

    - [[@laneEngineeringSerendipityWhen]] Moderate overlap, same workshop on grant, same ground. symmetry vs. asymmetry -> is that significant?
