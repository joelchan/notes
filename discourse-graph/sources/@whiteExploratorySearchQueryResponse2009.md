            - for [[D/Computational Analogy]]

                - this paper reviews [[exploratory search]] as a fundamental change in interaction paradigm from what they call the [[query-response paradigm]].

                - it's a highly useful starting point to see if we can graft [[analogical search]] into an [[exploratory search]] paradigm, or if we need to do more.

                    - cf. [[WP: Reimagining the (analogical) search engine]]

[[WP Reimagining the (analogical) search engine]]

- We could start with [[exploratory search]] (see, e.g., [[@whiteExploratorySearchQueryResponse2009]]) as a paradigm and see how far that gets us. But we might need to go further, or at least refine it.

    - For one, in [[exploratory search]], often the learner doesn't know about the domain, and needs to learn.

    - But often, in our case, the base domain is quite well-known. They're usually suffering from [[expert blind spot]]s, with latent constraints, due in part to [[üß± fixation]]

        - There might also be stronger barriers to [[query reformulation]] because of this. "I know what I'm looking for".
