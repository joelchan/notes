- Let's do some reflection on the main points of feedback on [[@chanKnowledgeSynthesisConceptual2020]] / [[[[PTN]] - discourse graph]] so far, in somewhat decreasing order of salience/importance:

    - `questions` as a central organizing principle really really resonate

        - For [[Joel Anderson]], they are a good candidate for setting the necessary [[context]] for [[idea: multiplayer zettelkastens]]

            - see also: [[idea: zettelconversations]]

            - questions as fundamental bridging/organizing principles

        - [[Brandon Toner]]: helping to close some loops, like the emphasis on questions as first-class citizens

        - [[Nikki Huang]]:

        - [[Sönke Ahrens]] also [finds it useful](important to re-emphasize structure/hierarchy, not jettison it (might have overshot in book)) to think about it as a helpful "top-down" organizing principle or "index" as a balance to bottom-up, horizontal linking without hierarchy

    - how does this play out against "speculation"? where do "`fleeting notes`" go? how to develop over time in in the "real mess"?

        - [[Jason Griffing]] calls it "hunches"

            - https://twitter.com/jasongriffing/status/1348100386301775873

        - [[Rob Haisfield]] calls it "speculation"

            - https://twitter.com/JoelChan86/status/1348134623604318209

    - how does this play against "concepts"?

        - currently "missing" from the model, but might be the primary object in some lines of work, like philosophy (could also see this being the case for lots of sociotech work, like [[[[PTN]] - boundary object]])

        - [[Joel Anderson]] in his work on philosophy, focus on development of concepts

    - how might this work in settings with less emphasis on observation notes, such as philosophy? is it appropriate?

        - [[Sönke Ahrens]] isn't sure that the [[[[PTN]] - discourse graph]] would quite work for philosophical work (much less emphasis on observation notes)

    - takes time!

    - these are #fieldnotes for [[P/PO study/dev for synthesis infrastructures]]
