        - Abstract

            - In recent years, the economic development world has come to recognize the pivotal role entrepreneurship plays in increasing a region's economic prosperity. Entrepreneurial approaches to economic development such as ‚Äúeconomic gardening,‚Äù first introduced in the City of Littleton, Colorado, focus on the important role that timely, reliable, and actionable business information plays in the success of small and growing local businesses. This approach to economic development provides public and university libraries with a unique opportunity to play an important role in their communities by supporting the business information needs of local entrepreneurs. This article addresses some of the successes and challenges that have arisen in the implementation of a pilot economic gardening project involving several libraries and business service entities in two communities in rural Michigan.

            - [librarians](local public, college, and university librarians in Michigan, associated with the MLA) found (formal) market research to be too time-consuming and difficult to justify

            - [librarians](local public, college, and university librarians in Michigan, associated with the MLA) reported that databases were often insufficient for answering specialized/contextual and up-to-date questions about competitive intelligence from [business owners](((1IihdiF97)))

            - [librarians](local public, college, and university librarians in Michigan, associated with the MLA) reported that sometimes the competitive intelligence questions required primary research (not just leveraging existing data) to answer satisfactorily

                related to this finding about [databases being insufficient on their own]([librarians](((MyrIxUriK))) reported that databases were often insufficient for answering specialized/contextual and up-to-date questions about competitive intelligence from [business owners](((1IihdiF97))))

            - [librarians](local public, college, and university librarians in Michigan, associated with the MLA) reported their perceptions that some questions about competitive intelligence were best answered by industry insiders

            - [librarians](local public, college, and university librarians in Michigan, associated with the MLA) perceived the analysis and synthesis work required to distill data into actionable business intelligence as a shift away from their traditional role of providing "unbiased delivery of information"

        - commentary

            - wish there were more details in general - here it's hard to tell how much of these are inferences from the researchers, without actual quotes from the librarians or specific examples

        - interesting! reported a [community of practice]([[communities of practice]]) forming around library business support under the economic gardening model

        - reported a "screening problem" (businesses not quite at the right place to use / act on the info yet)

            - reminds me very much of the stuff that we're seeing about a ["funnel" being central](Recurring theme of filtering businesses (similar to SCORE)) [to the work](((KdoLDX-Jf))) of the BSOs in our [[D/KNEXT]] sample

        - it didn't quite work out

            - librarians face cognitive and cultural/norm challenges synthesizing their market research for business owners #library-business-barriers

    - They reported a number of challenges from the study, including:

        - [librarians](((MyrIxUriK))) found (formal) market research to be too time-consuming and difficult to justify

    - However, they did find that librarians were comfortable with some key aspects of hte support task. For example, [librarians](((MyrIxUriK))) reported being able to effectively identify experts to consult for competitive intelligence questions
