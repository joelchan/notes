        - Abstract

            - We studied CAD system users to find out how they use the sophisticated customization and extension facilities offered by many CAD products. We found that users of varying levels of expertise collaborate to customize their CAD environments and to create programmatic extensions to their applications. Within a group of users, there is at least one local expert who provides support for other users. We call this person a local developer. The local developer is a fellow domain expert, not a professional programmer, outside technical consultant or MIS staff member. We found that in some CAD environments the support role has been formalized so that local developers are given official recognition, and time and resources to pursue local developer activities. In general, this formalization of the local developer role appears successful. We discuss the implications of our findings for work practices and for software design.

    - semi-structured interviews with 24 informants (21 users and 3 managers) who use the CAD system HP ME30 in the general fields of architecture, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and industrial design, across seveon companies of varying sizes. All informants had used the CAD system for at least five years.

    - The most interesting finding for us is the evolution of the local developer role into a function of doing low-level technical work and support (e.g., writing macros, tech support, troubleshooting) in the patterns of cooperation among CAD users.
