        - Reading notes: studies the information seeking behavior of Interdisciplinary field  scholars. This problem has not been investigated before.

            - Interdisciplinary field

                - = those high scatter fields

                - has more complex inquires over three-year period

            - Referenced [[SDI]] detailed in [[@housmanStateArtSelective1970]] (cited by [[@packerImportanceSDICurrent1979]]) that recommends paper to interdisciplinary scholars. Analyzed [[@packerImportanceSDICurrent1979]]

- intro has many papers that are worth referencing for us, talking about how models of [[information behavior]] do a good job of modeling *disciplinary* information seeking, but are far from sufficient for describing interdisciplinary information-seeking, leaving core questions posed by [[@bates1996learning]] basically unanswered

[[QUE - What are the most efficient routes to useful cross-boundary knowledge]]

- From [[@bates1996learning]]

    - This paper in general

        - Reading notes: studies the information seeking behavior of ((bRJ0i2ojg)) scholars. This problem has not been investigated before.

    - Claim that suggests clarification: The InfoSci assumption is that the
orignaization, description, indexing of inofmration in forms of indexes,
catalogs, and reference books makes information accessible to users.

        - Xin’s question/comment: not sure whether we
could say information is cross-boundary, or the attribute of cross-boundary **lies in its use** by interdisciplinary people

            - Social construction of technology

                - (Also as SCOT) is a theory within the field of science and technology studies. Advocates of SCOT argue that technology does not determine human action, but that rather, human action shapes technology.

            - Answer: why is information that is analogy far apart initially? Boundaries are there for what reason?

                - Maybe attention, or information-noise ratio? Different classification categories. Prioritize other kinds of metadata which are missing from current infrastructure.

                    - People studying ants / swan behavior vs. people working on crowd-workers

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FavxpL8Dyox.png?alt=media&token=384588ad-7bfb-4c42-be60-095d33cd9f1d) (p. 158)

        - Same information organization is having different effect for interdisciplinary researchers

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2Fw49-KSbHiD.png?alt=media&token=a1943137-58ef-406e-aa29-ebf2c67ab53b) (p. 159)

    - Potential and indirect claim: Citation indexes are likely useful signals for interdisciplinary researchers. The fact that citation index sometimes coming from **someone** in another field or is inherited afterwards by another field bypasses the vocabulary mismatch problem across different fields.

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FfHRGVMSAa7.png?alt=media&token=2c649a43-b16f-438f-8e33-fe7940c7b3c7) (p. 162)

        - There might be a process starting from the first citation attempt between domain A and domain B. It fruits into interdisciplinary journals (Bioinformatics, etc. )

        - Tracking down the citation indexes claim (as a secondary claim)

    - a paper call for research agenda
[[December 15th, 2020]]

- Reminders (from [[@bates1996learning]]):

    - [[@packerImportanceSDICurrent1979]] explores the efficacy of [[SDI]] as a function of [[Scatter]], and reports that [[SDI]] [use](((dvVQF3fsu))) was associated with a significant *reduction* in efficiency of keeping up to date with the literature for [scholars](((5IIOQ5CZq))) in [self-reported](((Iv7Euw1wK))) low-[[Scatter]] fields; in contrast, SDI use was **not** associated with efficiency for high-scatter scholars (although there was a numeric trend in a positive direction)

        - These findings are relevant for understanding [[[[QUE]] - What are the most efficient routes to useful cross-boundary knowledge?]], in the sense that efficiency is extremely important, because the costs are so high for navigating and assessing information across boundaries (which tend to be high [[Scatter]])

            - [[@packerImportanceSDICurrent1979]] in particular is instructive as a cautionary tale that a decontextualized recommender service can really help in boundary-crossing / [navigating]([[[[CLM]] - Interdisciplinary synthesis is hard because of scatter in the literature]]) high-[[Scatter]] / [[interdisciplinarity]]

                - seems like a supporting observation for [[[[QUE]] - What are the most efficient routes to useful cross-boundary knowledge?]]

                - this is really making me wonder about what we have discovered since [[SDI]]s

                    - I'm worried that most [[recommender system]]s work seems to be evaluated with offline evaluations. I recall that the [[sys/DocEar]] team has done some excellent work on evaluations

                        - Found this good paper comparing offline, online, and user study data

                            - Really low absolute performance (in the single digits at best)

                            - Thoughtful criticisms of offline datasets in light of [[[[CLM]] - Citation practices in science are far from optimal]] and other criticisms

                        - This paper quantifies the balance of eval methods: ~70% of approaches as of [[2013]] were with offline eval, 34% had a user study (only 10% in a detailed usage setting) - should prioritize looking up those papers to triangulate against [[@packerImportanceSDICurrent1979]]

                            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FrmKRL1R7Mr.png?alt=media&token=d6666784-fc10-45b1-9738-c585fd761281)

        - They also replicate the results of [[@moteReasonsVariationInformation1962]] in terms of time spent vs. [[Scatter]]

    - [[@moteReasonsVariationInformation1962]] articulates the idea of [[Scatter]], and shows how search effort varies as a function of scatter: specifically, they report that Scholars in fields of study with high degree of [[Scatter]] self-reported needing longer searches (> 30 mins) about 20x more frequently compared to scholars in low [[Scatter]] fields
[[@fisherTheoriesInformationBehavior2005]]

- [[@bates1996learning]] claims [[interdisciplinarity]] typically characterized by high degree of [[Scatter]]

    - Intriguing: there is an idea of [[SDI]] (Selective Dissemination of Information) as a way to deal with [[Scatter]], documented in part in [[@packerImportanceSDICurrent1979]]

        - As described in [[@bates1996learning]], [[SDI]] is basically librarian-powered recommendation systems for scholars :) Really curious to see how these stack up against a rec sys.
