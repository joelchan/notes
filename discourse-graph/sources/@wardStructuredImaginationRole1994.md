        - Abstract

            - College students imagined animals that might live on a planet somewhere else in the galaxy. In the first experiment, they provided drawings and descriptions of their initial imagined animal, another member of the same species, and a member of a different species. The majority of imagined creatures were structured by properties that are typical of animals on earth: bilateral symmetry, sensory receptors, and appendages. Subjects also allowed shape, appendages and sense receptors to vary often across species but rarely within species. In Experiment 2, subjects creations were influenced by correlated attributes; those told that the animal was feathered were more likely to produce creatures with wings and beaks, and those told it lived in water and had scales were more likely to produce creatures with fins and gills relative to subjects who were told the animal was furry or who were given no specific features. Experiments 3 and 4 revealed that many subjects approach the task by retrieving exemplars of known earth animals, but that instructions and task constraints can lead to greater use of broader knowledge frameworks. Experiment 5 revealed that the structuring found in college students imagined animals also holds for extraterrestrials developed by science fiction writers. The results are consistent with the idea that similar structures and processes underlie creative and noncreative aspects of cognition, and are discussed in terms of the concept of structured imagination. That is, when subjects create a new member of a known category for an imaginary setting, their imagination is structured by a particular set of properties that are characteristic of that category.

        - In Experiment 1, Ward reported that his participants [overwhelmingly used typical features]([Undergraduate students](((GLVjpDndf))) who were [asked to draw imaginary animals](((zwS0EXV9n))) frequently drew animals with [features](((3M9PoLNDg))) that were [typical of earth animals](((CwNnKVLFv))), such as bilateral symmetry, legs/arms/wings, and typical numbers of appendages and sense organs (e.g. two eyes/ears, one nose, two/four legs), although a substantial number of [drawings](((hYbIddsIH))) also had a [limited number of differences from earth animals](((O1BIsqaIh))), such as unusual sense organs or appendages.) from earth animals, such as bilateral symmetry, and [tended not to vary "core features"](((caor_iQvz))) such as appendages and organs when varying exemplars within species, consistent with attribute-listing studies. Based on this, Ward argues that people's imagination is structured by their knowledge of both features and how animals tend to vary in features, based on the fact

            - Should grab those attribute listing studies: Tversky & Hemenway 1974 is one

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FwYg5RWef4Q.png?alt=media&token=1e977ebd-3713-47bc-bc18-ea1ef32b4854)

            - Should note, at least in Experiment 1 and 2, no particular instructions are given to be creative: in fact, it's hard to tell what the students were expecting in terms of what counts as "good" for the task.

                - So it's hard to extrapolate this to real settings where people might have higher/lower motivation to be creative. I'm not even sure if this is the "base state". It's a data point, but I'm not quite sure how to contextualize a set of undergrad intro psych students doing this task for course credit wrt the population we actually care about: professionals trying to be creative in their jobs or endeavors they care about.

        - Skimming ahead, it looks like:

            - Experiment 2 is about another aspect of structuring: feature correlations, and also a potential mechanism of retrieving specific exemplars

            - Experiment 3 and 4 probe this mechanism of retrieving specific exemplars (again, I'm dubious that this is just a fact about how "people" do things...)

            - Experiment 5 is a bit more interesting: it analyzes imagined animals in science fiction writers. This helps me [think through](So it's hard to extrapolate this to real settings where people might have higher/lower motivation to be creative. I'm not even sure if this is the "base state". It's a data point, but I'm not quite sure how to contextualize a set of undergrad intro psych students doing this task for course credit wrt the population we actually care about: professionals trying to be creative in their jobs or endeavors they care about.) how the findings might relate to real-world settings.

    - These are fun to do, but probably not super urgent. Can chip away at them. More important and urgent would be studies and findings around [analogies]([[[[QUE]] - How might domain distance modulate the effects of analogies on creative output?]]) and [people and cross-boundary information]([[[[QUE]] - What are the most efficient routes to useful cross-boundary knowledge?]]) more specifically.

    - Honestly, feeling a bit overwhelmed by the prospect.

        - Can it be done faster? I'm not sure that it should! I don't think I was doing that much on the tech side: pace felt kind of like how one might do it with a regular template, or analog workflow like [[Raul Pacheco-Vega]]'s: it just takes time to read a paper well!

        - Feeling uncomfortable now with the idea of just using knowledge I haven't vetted.

        - It takes time to read! I should have done this well during my PhD!

        - This might be the high barrier to entry for people who are already further along: less of a problem I think if you're starting from this point. Or I guess if you have a single project to start with.
