        - Abstract

            - Engaging in long-term creative processes has been shown to elicit a variety of emotional states, some of which can be detrimental to the creator's wellbeing. Little is known about successful regulation of these states. This paper begins to bridge two disparate literatures in order to start building a theoretical framework which combines the neurological underpinnings of human motivation and emotion with modern theories of the creative process that highlight the importance of the external world. This framework will be used to design a digital intervention which supports emotional regulation during long-term creative processes in a way that targets specific interactions of the creator and their environment rather than provides generic management and coping strategies.
