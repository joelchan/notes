- Abstract:: Professional designers create mood boards to explore, visualize, and communicate hard-to-express ideas. We present ImageSense, an intelligent, collaborative ideation tool that combines individual and shared work spaces, as well as collaboration with multiple forms of intelligent agents. In the collection phase, ImageSense offers fluid transitions between serendipitous discovery of curated images via ImageCascade, combined text- and image-based Semantic search, and intelligent AI suggestions for finding new images. For later composition and reflection, ImageSense provides semantic labels, generated color palettes, and multiple tag clouds to help communicate the intent of the mood board. A study of nine professional designers revealed nuances in designers’ preferences for designer-led, system-led, and mixed-initiative approaches that evolve throughout the design process. We discuss the challenges in creating effective human-computer partnerships for creative activities, and suggest directions for future research. CCS Concepts: • Human-centered computing → Interactive systems and tools; Computer supported cooperative work; • Applied computing → Arts and humanities.

- [[mood board]]s are similar. [[@kochSemanticCollageEnrichingDigital2020]] and [[@kochImageSenseIntelligentCollaborative2020]]

    - what is interesting about [[sys/SemanticCollage]] and [[sys/ImageSense]] I think is the ability of the designers to *define* the model of the example space, in conversation with their model of the "problem/solution space" (on the mood board)

    - in fact, [[Andrés Lucero]] (who is on these papers) also has a bunch of papers digging into this (found through this [[sys/ConnectedPapers]] [map](https://www.connectedpapers.com/main/dc90eab30d08907c810fd12ebe9723609f49a0cd/Understanding-knowledge-management-practices-for-early-design-activity-and-its-implications-for-reuse/graph) around [[@sharminUnderstandingKnowledgeManagement2009b]])
