        - Abstract

            - The aim of the research is to investigate whether gifted intellectual abilities affect analogical transfer. The research uses two methods (I) observational techniques and (2) the training approach. Experiment I: The method developed by Gick and Holyoak was used to identify differences in analogical transfer between two groups: gifted and average students. Subjects were presented with a story analogy - the base domain (General) prior to the attempt to solve a problem - the target domain (Radiation problem). It was expected that gifted students because of their superior abilities would produce more dispersion solutions (enhanced by the base domain) than average ones. The results did not confinn this hypothesis. In Experiment 2 the same students participated as in Experiment 1. Both groups solved 6 problems whilst thinking aloud. The TA protocols were analysed with a taxonomy included three different types of analogies: association, transfonnation and abstract principle analogies. Gifted students used significantly more analogies for solving the problem than did average ones. The most often used were association analogies, in some cases transfonnation analogies were also used. Eight average students participated in Experiment 3. They were trained in problem solving. The training aimed at metacognition. The analogical training was based on Shank's (TOP) structure. The trained students before and after the training solved 3 problems, while thinking aloud. The training affected the problem solving perfonnance of the students, but not their analogical reasoning. Twenty-one students participated in the Experiment 4. The training given to students was to a greater extent geared towards improving the students' ability of analogical reasoning. Even though in the experiment much effort was devoted to the training of analogical reasoning the effects of this training were less impressive than those resulting from training in other strategies. The four experiments indicate that spontaneous analogies are extremely complex. and cannot be reduced just to the mapping process.
