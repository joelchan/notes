    - Lots of concrete stuff in here relevant for [[[[CLM]] - Prevailing incentives in academia are bad for science]], specifically about the fact that error detection work isn't rewarded. The generalization of this is that [[[[CLM]] - Error detection work in science is systematically undervalued]]
