            - some #[[âž° breadcrumbs]]

                - gift here in the section on beneficiaries as organizational actors (pp. 8-13)

                    - whitaker 1976 - larger orgs less responsive to intended beneficiaries --> less lieky to encourage coproduction

                    - new thread centered from 2000s in australia and europe

        - there's also a few key hypotheses about why clients are not more deeply integrated into service orgs

        - in section

        - secondary claims to follow up on

        - as well as the key results

            - analysis of mentions of beneficiaries in nonprofit management texts (short one on p. 13)
