- [[@yinQuantifyingDynamicsFailure2019]]

    - no smooth progression: a tipping point or phase transition from failure to success - two different regimes of failure

        - this really reminds me of the warmth ratings stuff from [[Insight problem solving]]!

        - power-law scaling of marginal cost

    - temporal rate of failures predicts eventual outcomes, separating those who eventually succeed from those who do not (constant = bad, fail faster = good)
