    - Title:: Framing, aligning, paradoxing, abstracting, and directing: how design mood boards work

    - Author(s):: [[Andr√©s Lucero]]

    - Abstract:: This paper builds upon the earlier work of Gaver on design workbooks by taking another design method and making a case for using it in HCI and interaction design. In this paper I discuss design mood boards, which consist of a collection of visually stimulating images and related materials. I present the results of an empirical study of how experienced designers from different disciplines (i.e., fashion, textile and industrial design) use mood boards as part of their work. The results suggest that mood boards can play five main roles in the early stages of the design process: framing, aligning, paradoxing, abstracting, and directing. I also reflect on design practice by providing concrete examples of mood boards and the resulting prototypes for an interaction design project. These examples are used to ground the discussion on the five roles found in the study.

            - I think it's fine to think of [[[[PTN]] - design mood board]]s as a design pattern

        - ## results of interest and discussion

            - [[[[EVD]] - expert designers used mood boards in their practice to frame the design problem, both alone and in conjunction with a client - [[@luceroFramingAligningParadoxing2012]]]]

                - i think this [[Supports]] the claim that [[[[CLM]] - creative workers use examples to support problem (re)formulation]] because mood boards contain concrete examples, though [often not from the same domain]([[[[EVD]] - Designers constructed mood boards primarily from concrete design materials and examples, usually not from the immediate domain of the problem, and manipulate their abstraction level as appropriate when using them to shape design work - [[@luceroFramingAligningParadoxing2012]]]])

            - [[[[EVD]] - Designers constructed mood boards primarily from concrete design materials and examples, usually not from the immediate domain of the problem, and manipulate their abstraction level as appropriate when using them to shape design work - [[@luceroFramingAligningParadoxing2012]]]]

                - this i think [[Supports]] the claim that [[[[CLM]] - Analogical distance of inspirations for an idea are positively related to the idea's creativity]]

            - [[[[EVD]] - Designers reported that visual juxtaposition of often contradictory themes, in the context of a coherent whole, on mood boards was essential for productively reframing the design problem - [[@luceroFramingAligningParadoxing2012]]]]

                - this [[Supports]] [[[[CLM]] - diverse examples improve creative outcomes by enabling novel conceptual integrations]]
