    - Title:: Framing, aligning, paradoxing, abstracting, and directing: how design mood boards work

    - Author(s):: [[Andr√©s Lucero]]

    - Abstract:: This paper builds upon the earlier work of Gaver on design workbooks by taking another design method and making a case for using it in HCI and interaction design. In this paper I discuss design mood boards, which consist of a collection of visually stimulating images and related materials. I present the results of an empirical study of how experienced designers from different disciplines (i.e., fashion, textile and industrial design) use mood boards as part of their work. The results suggest that mood boards can play five main roles in the early stages of the design process: framing, aligning, paradoxing, abstracting, and directing. I also reflect on design practice by providing concrete examples of mood boards and the resulting prototypes for an interaction design project. These examples are used to ground the discussion on the five roles found in the study.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Here, images might be thought of as artefacts to be gathered and manipulated, combined and annotated. Ways of supporting these activities have been highlighted before; our findings are in line with analyses of the ways in which existing tools, such as mood boards, are used ([Lucero, 2012]([[@luceroFramingAligningParadoxing2012]])), as well with recommendations that highlight the need to support the management and laying out of collected examples ([Keller et al, 2009]([[@kellerCollectingCabinetHow2009]]);[Mendels et al, 2011]([[@mendelsFreedSystemCreating2011]])) and their flexible annotation ([Herring et al, 2009]([[@herringGettingInspiredUnderstanding2009]]);[Sharmin et al, 2009]([[@sharminUnderstandingKnowledgeManagement2009b]])).

- Reading [[@luceroFramingAligningParadoxing2012]] for [[[[THE]] - interaction-oriented theory of creative inspiration from examples]]

    - We're spanning two literatures that don't interact as much: the fundamental cognitive literature, which provides mechanisms ([[analogy]], [[üß± conceptual combination]]), and more applied/design literature, that is rich in context, and respects differences and similarities across design disciplines. Keep this in mind, and counteract the cognitive tendency to collapse them under "creative work". Look for the generative differences and nuances. Synthesize!

    - There are also methodological implications of this theory, mostly for experimental studies: we cannot divorce the effects of examples from the means of interaction with them. That much is clear from studies of design practice with examples. I am now much more suspicious of negative findings about diverse or distant examples.

    - I'm struck by the discussion of out of domain examples. Really really really reminiscent of [[[[CLM]] - A significant proportion of the benefits of analogical stimuli is oblique or indirect]]: it's not about direct transfer of features, but of.... *stimulating a conversation*, a rethinking. How does this happen? Through juxtaposition, reinterpretation, conversation.

        - Again, reminds me so much of the richness in [[[[EVD]] - designers used a range of strategies for working with sources of inspiration, ranging from simpler, more source-driven strategies like direct source adaptation, to more complex and reflective strategies like source analysis and schema-driven source selection; complex strategies were more likely to be used by professionals and also more associated with radical transformation of sources - [[@eckertAdaptationSourcesInspiration2003]]]]
