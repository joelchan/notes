    - Title:: Framing, aligning, paradoxing, abstracting, and directing: how design mood boards work

    - Author(s):: [[Andr√©s Lucero]]

    - Abstract:: This paper builds upon the earlier work of Gaver on design workbooks by taking another design method and making a case for using it in HCI and interaction design. In this paper I discuss design mood boards, which consist of a collection of visually stimulating images and related materials. I present the results of an empirical study of how experienced designers from different disciplines (i.e., fashion, textile and industrial design) use mood boards as part of their work. The results suggest that mood boards can play five main roles in the early stages of the design process: framing, aligning, paradoxing, abstracting, and directing. I also reflect on design practice by providing concrete examples of mood boards and the resulting prototypes for an interaction design project. These examples are used to ground the discussion on the five roles found in the study.
