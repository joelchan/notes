        - There is a rich variety of models and descriptions of [[scholarly primitives]], often amongst humanities and social science scholars

            - Origin of idea of [[scholarly primitives]] is credited to [[Unsworth]]

            - Many process models discussed in [[information behavior]] literature in [[LIS]] (p. 8)

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FQ1ata0738c?alt=media&token=1ac8e3a8-4b87-4d80-8ab0-481d00e9573f)

        - They synthesize past ideas into a model with five core [[scholarly primitives]], including searching, collecting, reading, writing, collaborating, and so on. Each of these primitives have sub-primitives (p. 9)

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FjDKJWYgg1E?alt=media&token=0706a977-2e89-4ccb-a460-399725f879a0)

            - [[synthesis]] is notably lacking in the model, but can be sort of mapped to the Assembling sub-primitive of Writing

                - Possibly also connected to the cross-cutting primitives of Note-taking and Translating and the Reading sub-primitives of scanning, assessing, and re-reading

                    - Notetaking and Assembling are some of the more interesting ones

                    - Diuscussion of Notetaking doesn't really distinguish systematically between levels/stages of processing as we do; might need more distinctions to better design infotech

        - Re-reading is a sub-primitive of the scholarly primitive of reading
