- cool Bayesian interaction framework to enable AI to assist with creating more error-tolerant interactions (here for typing on mobile keyboard) - I think it's from [[@zhuUsingBayesTheorem2020]]?

    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FHM7ftQ2Yxf.png?alt=media&token=2e276b3a-1dc7-4d16-a46b-e4188091561f)

    - this seems.... relevant to [[that can't pin it down local optimum tradeoff thing]]

        - making structuring work much more tolerant of fuzziness and "errors" (imprecision) in input

        - could the knowledge graph help ground the prior model?

    - reminds me very much of [[@changSupportingMobileSensemaking2016]], connecting to the ongoing idea of [[[[PTN]] - flexible compression]]
