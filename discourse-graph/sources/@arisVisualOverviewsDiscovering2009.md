- Abstract:: Gaining a rapid overview of an emerging scientific topic, sometimescalled researchfronts, is anincreasinglycom- mon task due to the growing amount of interdisciplinary collaboration. Visual overviews that show temporal pat- terns of paper publication and citation links among papers can help researchers and analysts to see the rate of growth of topics, identify key papers, and understand influences across subdisciplines. This article applies a novel network-visualization tool based on meaningful layouts of nodes to present research fronts and show citation links that indicate influences across research fronts.To demonstrate the value of two-dimensional lay- outs with multiple regions and user control of link visi- bility, we conducted a design-oriented, preliminary case study with 6 domain experts over a 4-month period. The main benefits were being able (a) to easily identify key papers and see the increasing number of papers within a research front, and (b) to quickly see the strength and direction of influence across related research fronts.

    - (0) Can help innovators explore a problem space, get a sense of the state of the art, where the &quot;fronts&quot; are, where things are moving, etc.
