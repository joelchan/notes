        - Abstract

            - We set out to support three rural communities in Uganda to manage their water supplies using a locally relevant and fit-foruse technological intervention developed with the CommunityBased Co-design (CBCD) method. This participatory and inclusive approach allowed us to introduce Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to communities that are untrained and inexperienced in technology design. We describe the intervention and identify research learnings for CBCD. Our design experience with the communities highlights the barriers and enablers of using the CBCD method with rural users. We conclude with reflections on the use of intermediaries and the issue of reciprocity in community-based ICT for development research.

    - concept of intermediaries ("human access points, champions, or gatekeepers") again as necessary for [[Participatory Design]] with rural users

    - NGOs and gov institutions may be necessary, for sustainability reasons: some users may lack power and resources to sustain solution, so those with power and resources need to be involved somehow. this can get complicated, i imagine!

    - methods notes

        - initial intermediary was a community learning facilitator from an international NGO that had previously funded projects in the communities. the NGO had to leave bc their funding ended and they couldn't secure more funding. next intermediary was a water officer from local government.

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FmNbghS-TsH.png?alt=media&token=d2a2af74-d6f1-4abc-bd2f-dad19790e972) (p. 93)

        - setting here: ~60 participants across stakeholder groups for problem of rural water management in Uganda, over the course of roughly a year.

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2Fo4rO6Lq2v7.png?alt=media&token=fa3428fb-2536-4616-ae28-64eb7bcab22f) (p. 93)

        - project involved situational analysis, first workshop (initial needfinding), second workshop (collaborative design, with reflections and outputs and high-fidelity prototype), third workshop (with initial prototype + training), formative evaluation after using prototype for 6 months (through semi-structured interviews with individual users) and fourth workshop (clarifying feedback from deploy). workshops varied from 2-3 days of ~6 hrs each.

    - so what can we take from this?

        - the most interesting piece for me is the observation about intermediaries who "spoke for the users" in section 4.2: "on a government official as intermediary": [[[[EVD]] - Intermediaries such as local government officials were necessary for accessing and co-designing with marginalized populations, but the intermediaries sometimes spoke for the people in ways that opposed what they really wanted - [[@ssozi-mugaruraSupportingCommunityNeeds2016]]]]

            - this connects with our discussions of the tensions and tradeoffs around "[extra stakeholders]([[[[CLM]] - Marginalized user populations may require involvement of extra stakeholders who may complicate hearing the users' voices]])"

        - secondarily, there was a reflection on the need for more high-fidelity prototypes __in situ__ for meaningful design feedback to emerge, which required some creative re-rigging of the prototypes (local-first, offline data capture, etc.): [[[[EVD]] - In-situ prototypes were needed to enable genuine design input from local marginalized users, which required creative adaptations to the prototypes - [[@ssozi-mugaruraSupportingCommunityNeeds2016]]]]

            - this connects with our discussions of the tensions and tradeoffs around space, and possibly also design compromises due to limitations of the users (e.g., [physical prototypes for users with dementia]([[[[EVD]] - physical prototypes were necessary to prompt aid discussion with codesigners with dementia, but also led to fixation on unfinished aspects of the design - [[@lindsayEmpathyParticipatoryDesign2012b]]]]), or [concrete exemplars with 3rd-graders]([[[[EVD]] - Designers experienced issues with (and had to compromise) design activities, such as analogies and giving concrete examplers, with 3rd-graders due to cognitive and difficulties with focus and abstract ideas - [[@largeBondedDesignNovel2006]]]]))

- [[Sarah Dipasquale]]: in [[@ssozi-mugaruraSupportingCommunityNeeds2016]], saw similar theme of participants not knowing how much they really knew and could contribute

    - [[Elizabeth Bonsignore]]: "I'm not a designer"

        - does this "I'm not a designer" thing interact with (maybe get intensified by) marginalization?

            - [[Elizabeth Bonsignore]] important to counter deficit-based models; antidote is [[asset-based community development (ABCD)]] and [[funds of knowledge]] perspective: find and build up local champions

                - some good stuff at [[CSCW]], see, e.g., [[Sheena Erete]]

    - could be influenced by power dynamics?

- needed intermediate person to help set up (similar to [[@ssozi-mugaruraSupportingCommunityNeeds2016]])

    - e.g., aboriginal member vouching for researcher

    - these themes also really stood out to [[Elizabeth Bonsignore]]

        - multi-stakeholder thing connects with work on science everywhere where there were many "end users" (e.g., parents, community)
