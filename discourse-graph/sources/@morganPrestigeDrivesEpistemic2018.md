        - #m/Model repurposing an SIS model from epidemiology

            - some questionable assumptions about "ideas" and "idea quality". #[[‚ùóbeware]] until it's replicated with empirical data

                - some issues that quickly come to mind:

                    - idea == "topic" (way too coarse-grained: if department X starts working more on topic X if new hire Y works on X, that seems...trivially true).

                    - results in fig. 6 are based on an SIS model. only as good as assumptions.

                    - equating idea "quality" with transmission probability - questionable (some really good ideas might be less transmissible bc they go against the grain, are hard to understand, ahead of their time, etc., and

                    - doesn't account for 2nd-order spread mechanisms (e.g., faculty from similar network). potentially underestimating effects of prestige.

                - prior is strong though for effects of prestige. should look at these studies more closely.
