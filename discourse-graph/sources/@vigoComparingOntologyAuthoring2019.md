        - From lab to [[m/s/In vivo]] we have a big difference in terms of the centrality of **editing** (p. 8)

        - #appraisal [[m/Log analysis]] is great, but I wish there was more on the **experience** of it. They're also studying ontology authoring as a disembedded task from a [[scholarly workflows]], either because they are training novices, or observing [[ontology engineers]] in their regular job (unclear how integrated or not this is from a real [[scholarly workflows]])

            - In other words, mostly helps answer question [[[[QUE]] - What is the user experience of dedicated semantic authoring?]], but not sure what it says exactly for [[[[QUE]] - What is the user experience of semantic authoring within regular scholarly workflows?]]

        - #lit-context

            - [[m/Quantitative]] [[m/Log analysis]] of both [[m/s/Lab]], semi-controlled, and [[m/s/In vivo]] authoring of [[ontologies]] using the [[sys/Protege]] ontology authoring tool
