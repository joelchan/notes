        - great synthesis lecture on many different approaches to thinking about [[context]], ranging from [[LIS]] to [[Context-Aware Computing]], and so on. Recognize citations in here from Abowd, [[Paul Dourish]], and others.

        - [[context]] is... contextual? Hard to pin down. What counts as "context" for a person is very dependent on other contextual factors. Probably the same for information objects. (p.7)
