        - great synthesis lecture on many different approaches to thinking about [[context]], ranging from [[LIS]] to [[Context-Aware Computing]], and so on. Recognize citations in here from Abowd, [[Paul Dourish]], and others.

        - [[context]] is... contextual? Hard to pin down. What counts as "context" for a person is very dependent on other contextual factors. Probably the same for information objects. (p.7)

- Important to flesh out the idea of context for [[John Thesis]]. Looked at the synthesis lecture on context I found the other day [[@agarwalExploringContextInformation2017]]. It focuses on Context of the __information seeker__ though, less on the context of the information artifact itself (as is the focus in CSCW studies of [[reuse]])

    - I think there is still a shared idea of [[context]] is... contextual? Hard to pin down. What counts as "context" for a person is very dependent on other contextual factors. Probably the same for information objects. (p.7) [[@agarwalExploringContextInformation2017]]

            - Could have sworn I've seen this paper before: why isn't it in my collection? Where is it??? Haha. POrobably in evernote?

                - Ah indeed in Evernote

                - Nice #example-of something that was "lost" but not really "lost" (came back around eventually). Q is how much was lost in the meantime.

            - anyway, #[[‚û∞ breadcrumbs]] this is a foundational paper to deep-read and create lit-notes on for [[[[CLM]] - Contextualizability is necessary for synthesis]], along with [[@ackermanOrganizationalMemoryObjects2004]] and [[@luttersBoundaryObjectsCollaborative2007]]

        - This complicates [[[[CLM]] - Contextualizability is necessary for synthesis]]

    - [[@agarwalExploringContextInformation2017]] is actually way more relevant for [[[[CLM]] - Information needs can vary on a general-to-contextual dimension]]

    - What implications does [this](I think there is still a shared idea of ((PNK8FrlWG)) [[@agarwalExploringContextInformation2017]]) have for our standards for synthesis infrastructures? One simple idea is to recognize the impossibility of exhaustively **representing** [[context]] in shared repositories, and move towards [[affordances]] that are more "pointer-like". I think [[transclusion]] is a nice example of this, where the cost of accessing (pointing to) the necessary context is way lower than a disembedded copy/paste reference. This is one reason that citation statements are so frustrating and dead, and [[std/Hypertext]] is so much more alive, and why I love [[block references]] in [[sys/RoamResearch]].

        - We do want easy ways, though, to not only "get to" the context, but "pull" it into my current space so I can work with it, for [[synthesis]]. Simple example is if I want to "slice and dice" my knowledge base to explore edge cases around where patients are from, dosage, sampling procedure, etc.
