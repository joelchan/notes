    - Content

        - Abstract

            - To determine whether a scientist working within the limits of a single subject makes fewer demands for assistance in information retrieval than one whose activities are not so limited.

    - #lit-context

        - sample: 178

        - [[replicated-by]] [[@packerImportanceSDICurrent1979]] with [this result]([Scholars](((5IIOQ5CZq))) in high [[Scatter]] and low scatter domains [self-reported](((Iv7Euw1wK))) equal levels of success at keeping up to date with relevant literature, but at the cost of [time](((rjdnxKjgt))) (high-scatter 2x more likely to spend > 5 hrs/wk on lit))

    - #[[📝 lit-notes]]

        - #Claim  [[Scatter]] makes [[🧱 foraging]] harder (p. 172)

            - #[[observation-notes]]

                - Scholars in fields of study with high degree of [[Scatter]] self-reported needing longer searches (> 30 mins) about 20x more frequently compared to scholars in low [[Scatter]] fields

###### Discourse Context

- **Informs::** [[CLM - In interdisciplinary domains, network-based foraging is more powerful than search-based foraging]]
- **Informs::** [[CLM - Interdisciplinary synthesis is hard because of scatter in the literature]]
- **Informs::** [[QUE - What are the most efficient routes to useful cross-boundary knowledge]]

###### References

[[@fisherTheoriesInformationBehavior2005]]

- [[Scatter]] introduced by [[@moteReasonsVariationInformation1962]]  - low scatter domain = underlying principles well-developed (paradigmatic??), lit well organized, width of subject area relatively small and clearly defined

    - [[@bates1996learning]] claims [[interdisciplinarity]] typically characterized by high degree of [[Scatter]]

        - Intriguing: there is an idea of [[SDI]] (Selective Dissemination of Information) as a way to deal with [[Scatter]], documented in part in [[@packerImportanceSDICurrent1979]]

            - As described in [[@bates1996learning]], [[SDI]] is basically librarian-powered recommendation systems for scholars :) Really curious to see how these stack up against a rec sys.

    - Ah! As I suspected: some are arguing ([[@bates1996learning]]; [[@palmerAligningStudiesInformation1999]]) that [[interdisciplinarity]] influences scholars' information practices. SHould dig into that to get into what they're really saying about __how__ precisely the practices are impacted by degree of [[interdisciplinarity]]
