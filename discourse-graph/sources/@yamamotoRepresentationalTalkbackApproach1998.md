        - Abstract

            - Designing documents, such as writing a technical paper, manual or WWW home pages, starts with a goal in mind but often does not simply proceed in a top down problem solving style. The document design process consists of a cycle of interpretation, modification and understanding. It requires both generating parts (words, sentences, and paragraphs) and structuring them while exploring what to write. Our research aims at supporting this collage or trial and error style of writing as design, drawing on the concepts of reflection in action and hermeneutics. We propose ‚Äúrepresentational talkback‚Äù, which is feedback from intermediate situations that emerge during writing. We postulate that by providing writers with appropriate representations to amplify this talkback, we enhance their writing process. The paper presents a theoretical framework of our approach and reports a user study using a prototype system ART (Amplifying Representational Talkback) to understand what types of talkback are necessary during writing and possible representations for them

- A serious limitation of [[sys/RoamResearch]] is the friction of moving to nonverbal / visual modalities of exploration. While [[[[CL]] - Visual thinking interfaces are tricky to get right]], most serious work probably has to move between verbal and nonverbal (less propositional?) modalities of representation: the holy grail is being able to move between the two (incidentally this is what [[sys/Liquid:Author]] can do, and is anticipated by the idea of [[[[PTN]] - representational talkback]] introduced in [[@yamamotoRepresentationalTalkbackApproach1998]]), and strongly related to this idea of [[Reflective Conversation with the Design Material]] and [co-evolution of design and problem space]( [[[[CLM]] - Design proceeds by co-evolution of problem and solution space]])

    - [[sys/RoamResearch]] does have some workarounds, like being able to paste in screenshots of sketches, and specifying diagrams (e.g., via [[sys/Mermaid diagrams]]) or tables from text, but the moving between isn't as fluid as I'd like, and the messy sketches in particular feel "inert" and unable to interact on equal terms with the rest of the content (e.g., can't add pages post-hoc, block ref, etc.)

        - maybe some kind of interaction overlay on top of pasted in screenshots could do the trick? or in-built "layers" (not very unlike layers in photoshop and most image editing software, and how on paper you only really have soft "mutability" via layering on top, and some with erasing)

    - Beyond the cognitive consequences of this interaction / modality limitation, the highly textual and nonvisual nature of this interface can be an unnecessary turnoff for many users who like visual interfaces
