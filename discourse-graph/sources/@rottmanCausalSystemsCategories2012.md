- Title:: Causal Systems Categories: Differences in Novice and Expert Categorization of Causal Phenomena
- Author(s):: [[B. M. Rottman]], [[D. Gentner]], [[M. B. Goldwater]]
- Abstract:: We investigated the understanding of causal systems categories-categories defined by common causal structure rather than by common domain content-among college students. We asked students who were either novices or experts in the physical sciences to sort descriptions of real-world phenomena that varied in their causal structure (e.g., negative feedback vs. causal chain) and in their content domain (e.g., economics vs. biology). Our hypothesis was that there would be a shift from domain-based sorting to causal sorting with increasing expertise in the relevant domains. This prediction was borne out: The novice groups sorted primarily by domain and the expert group sorted by causal category. These results suggest that science training facilitates insight about causal structures.
