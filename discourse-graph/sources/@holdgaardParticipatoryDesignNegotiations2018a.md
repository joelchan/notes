        - Abstract

            - In this paper, we discuss two emerging controversies in the meeting between participatory design (PD) ideals and the funding regime in an EU-funded cross-sector partnership project with seven partners. We argue that this discussion is much needed within the PD community, as more and more research is funded through outlets that challenge current design practices in PD that emphasize bottom-up and open-ended processes. We argue for a continued need for reflexive PD practices that take implications of publicly funded cross-sector partnerships into account.

- For funding, the core insight Salma articulated is more about the shift in understanding from something whose significance is mainly restricted to whether something happens or not, to something that exerts an ongoing influence throughout the process. But this doesn't quite resonate for me. At the risk of sounding trite, this seems... kind of obvious? Or high level? I hate that I feel this way. I think maybe the deeper key insight is the **deepening of the core tension between the need for sustainable funding (and the potential of industry funding to supplement this) and the "project-ing" attached to industry**. Refs 18 [[@dachteraResearchResearchDesign2014]] and 34 [[@holdgaardParticipatoryDesignNegotiations2018a]] (which theorizes the idea of "project-ing" as in conflict with the open-ended nature of PD) are cited in our paper to point to this idea, and these are wonderful theorizing and deep dives into a single case study each. I think we deepen this insight by giving voice to practitioner experiences across a range of different projects aimed at (marginalized) children in particular, extending the thematic range of prior empirical findings

    - Need for funding

        - > P7 shared how “__it was the end of my postdoc, so again this funding possibilities. and I left… I wasn’t able to sustain this collaboration that had started and taken place over a year and a half. I couldn’t continue on my own__.” As P7 succinctly put, “__how do you continue these things? You can't because there's no support__.”

    - But constraints on open-endedness and subversiveness of design outputs vs. "products" and "project-ing" that comes with funding

        - The latter can be especially tough to navigate when the partners have less power; even less likely that their voice would successfully push back against "project-ing"

        - > P7 recounted, “__for me it has always been more stressful to have industry partners__.” P7 continued, “__because industry is also expecting certain results that I'm not sure I know how to cater for when I am more interested in keeping things a bit open-ended__.”

        - > P3 stated, “__I think it cost me a year of my life in terms of stress and to navigate all that because it was quite complicated with all the different agendas among the project partners...we had quite strict deliverables and milestones and things that we needed to develop__.”

        - > P6 shared an anecdote where “__the whole process was about designing something for kids that kids wanted and this adult kept going, ‘No, you can't do that,’ because you know in their head they had this restrictive idea of like ‘this is how we have to build
the product.__’”

        - > P5 shared that “__there's a little bit more pressure sometimes to get that prototype out the door and there is also sometimes reliance more on the adult’s ideas in industry and it takes some building of trust to be able to actually trust what kids are saying sometimes__.”

        - > P1 reflected how funding partners' “__goals and your goals might be different. So, the partner's overarching goals might be to create this awesome product to make more money but then you find out your assumptions are all wrong because kids don't know what this means so your design is wrong__.”
