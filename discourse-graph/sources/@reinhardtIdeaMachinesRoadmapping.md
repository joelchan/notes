- Listening to [[@reinhardtIdeaMachinesRoadmapping]]

    - ~15:28

        - The work of [[Technological RoadMapping]] sparks the idea of "analogies for constraint discovery". How do you discover hte most important constraints/assumptions in your problem space, and figure out which ones are hard/soft/flexible s.t. you can find new opportunities for progress? (cf. [[WP: Augmenting scientific creativity with analogical inspirations]])

            - [[Adam Marblestone]] concedes that he doesn't yet know how to extend this approach to diverse kinds of problems that are quite different from the original context of "how do you measure X" (where x is neural signals)

                - not sure if it will work for intervention-style problems or problems that require deeper understanding

            - Analogies might help spark the right questions if the comparison is apt

            - This yields quite different optimization function than "find relevant things" or "find things with ideas I can use". It's more, find things that increase my understanding of the constraint space of my problem, which then allows for wider/better exploration (but first step can be separable from the second).

    - 18:48 - what does the actual process look like?

        - process of [[synthesis]]

        - lots of notes on phone, reading

        - some combo of writing and reading at the same time, guided by tree of questions (existing [[Schema]])
