- Title:: Computer-Mediated Communication: Impersonal, Interpersonal, and Hyperpersonal Interaction
- Author(s):: [[J. B. Walther]]
- Abstract:: While computer-mediated communication use and research are proliferating rapidly, findi,ngs offer contrasting images regarding the interpersonal char acter of this technology. Research trends over the history of these media are reviewed with observations acrOBB trends suggested so as to provide integra tive principles with which to apply media to different circumstances. First, the notion that the media reduce personal influence&â€“their impersonal effects-i.s reviewed. Newer theories and research are noted explaining nor mative "interpersonal" uses oft he media. From this vantage point, recognizing that impersonal communication is sometimes advantageous, strategies for the intentional depersonalization ofm edia use are inferred, with implications for Group Decision Support Systems effects. Additi_onally, recognizing that media sometimes facilitate communication that surpasses normal interpersonal levels, a new perspective on "hyperpersonal" communication is introduced. SubproceBSes are discussed pertaining to receivers, senders, channels, and feedback elements in computer-mediated communication that may enhance impreBBions and interpersonal relations.
