- Title:: The Role of Knowledge in Discourse Comprehension: A Construction-Integration Model
- Author(s):: [[W. Kintsch]]
- Abstract:: In contrast to expectation-based, predictive views of discourse comprehension, a model is developed in which the initial processing is strictly bottom-up. Word meanings are activated, propositions are formed, and inferences and elaborations are produced without regard to the discourse context. However, a network of interrelated items is created in this manner, which can be integrated into a coherent structure through a spreading activation process. Data concerning the time course of word identification in a discourse context are examined. A simulation of arithmetic word-problem under- standing provides a plausible account for some well-known phenomena in this area.
