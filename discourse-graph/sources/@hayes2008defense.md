- Interestingly, [[@hayes2008defense]] claims that, frequently, "making further ontological distinctions often leads to more ambiguity, not less"

    - Which reminds me strongly again of [[[[CLM]] - Universal Semantic Webs are neither feasible nor useful]], and [[[[CLM]] - Knowledge is fundamentally contextual]]

    - In particular, I think I recall [[@halfordDigitalFuturesSociological2013]] making [almost this exact argument against](But naming entities is far from straightforward. See, e.g., [[@bowkerSortingThingsOut2000]] and [[@randallDistributedOntologyBuilding2011]]) [[URIs]]

    - important point here about the relationship between [[[[PTN]] - discourse graph]] and [[knowledge graph]]s: one might say that in the majority of instances, discourse determines entity resolution (resolving references for names). in some ways, that comes before any a priori attempt to define names in a vacuum (outside usage). so discourse graphs might be the more general architecture, with all of its useful [[ambiguity]], within which we can integrate formal knowledge graphs for specific applications, as appropriate.

        - this reminds me of the usefulness of [[[[PTN]] - boundary object]]s as connective tissue between disparate worlds: ill-structured in common use, strongly structured in local use

            - wrote about this on [[January 25th, 2021]]: To connect back to [[[[PTN]] - boundary object]]s, [[knowledge graph]]s with atomic concepts as nodes feels closer to classical formal [[ontologies]], which make strong assumptions about what should be in/out of the model. This is a SPECIAL CASE of reality! THE MODAL case is ambiguity and variation: it is perhaps for this reason that (effective) [[[[PTN]] - boundary object]]s are weakly structured in common use, and only strongly structured in local use
