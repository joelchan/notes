        - Abstract

            - Design educators often comment on the difficulties that result from a premature commitment by students to a solution to a design problem. Similarly practitioners can find it difficult to move away from an idea they have developed or precedents in a field. In the psychology of problem solving this effect is called functional fixedness or fixation. This refers to the observation that people find it very difficult to see, for example, that objects with well known uses or functions can be employed in new or unusual ways to develop an innovative solution to a problem or to solve a problem that requires innovation. Given that fixation refers to situations where innovation is blocked, it is not surprising that these effects should occur in design problem solving. Design problems are essentially ill-defined problems. As such they inherently contain the opportunity for innovation. However, while these types of issues have been discussed in the context of design, there has been little systematic evidence available about whether or not and under what conditions design fixation does occur. The paper reviews the results of a series of recent experiments which begin to addresses these issues. The results of the experiments will then be examined in terms of what insights they provide into the design process and what implications they have for design education and their relevance for the role that computers may play in the design process.
