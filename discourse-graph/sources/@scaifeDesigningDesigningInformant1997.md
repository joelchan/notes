        - Abstract

            - The value of involving people as ‘users’ or ‘participants’ in the design process is increasingly becoming a point of debate. In this paper we describe a new framework, called ‘informant design’, which advocates efficiency of input from different people: maximizing the value of contributions tlom various informants and design team members at different stages of the design process. To illustrate how this can be achieved we describe a project that uses children and teachers as informants at difTerent stages to help us design an interactive learning environment for teaching ecology.

In addition to the 60 kids in the UK nine pairs of students of the same age in America were questioned along with 5 of their teachers. The children were used as informant designers throughout the study.

- [[Informant Design]], per [[@scaifeDesigningDesigningInformant1997]]: context of educational software, and focuses on adapting [[Participatory Design]] for the reality that children will never reach full equality with adults in the same session (inherent power dynamics, and also limitations of time, knowledge, and expertise)
