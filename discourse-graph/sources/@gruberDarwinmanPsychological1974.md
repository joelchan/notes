- Here is an eloquent quote on this from this analysis of Darwin's process towards his theory of evolution [[@gruberDarwinmanPsychological1974]]:

    - > The two kinds of task, theoretical and evidential, entail different activities, and in the long run they may yield distinguishable products for our consideration. But __in vivo__, in the life of the thinking person, they are thoroughly intertwined. The most speculative "castle in the air" is triggered by a simple observation or a friend's remark about his dog. Hard work amassing the facts on a special point is guided by a long theoretical argument with which it may have only a tenuous logical relationship: the theory does not absolutely depend on the facts, nor could the facts ever guarantee the theory. The relation of theory and evidence is not simply logical but psychological.
