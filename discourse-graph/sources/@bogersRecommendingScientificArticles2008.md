            - Abstract

                - We describe the use of the social reference management website CiteULike for recommending scientific articles to users, based on their reference library. We test three different collaborative filtering algorithms, and find that user-based filtering performs best. A temporal analysis of the data indexed by CiteULike shows that it takes about two years for the cold-start problem to disappear and recommendation performance to improve.
