        - Abstract

            - We present empirical data on frequency and pattern of misprints in citations to twelve highprofile papers. We find that the distribution of misprints, ranked by frequency of their repetition, follows Zipfâ€™s law. We propose a stochastic model of citation process, which explains these findings, and leads to the conclusion that about 70-90% of scientific citations are copied from the lists of references used in other papers.
