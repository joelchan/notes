        - Abstract

            - We present empirical data on frequency and pattern of misprints in citations to twelve highprofile papers. We find that the distribution of misprints, ranked by frequency of their repetition, follows Zipf’s law. We propose a stochastic model of citation process, which explains these findings, and leads to the conclusion that about 70-90% of scientific citations are copied from the lists of references used in other papers.

    - FWIW, these findings are consistent with a couple other later papers, [per scite](https://scite.ai/reports/stochastic-modeling-of-citation-slips-Odndy8?contradicting=false&mentioning=false&page=1&utm_campaign=badge_generic&utm_medium=plugin&utm_source=generic)

                - "In particular our model and data suggest that around 70% to 80% of papers cited are 'subsidiary papers', that is papers which are also cited by the other papers in the bibliography, the 'core papers'. Similar results have been seen by [[@simkinStochasticModelingCitation2005]] who use a similar model but different data and methods to arrive at this result. From a different perspective, [[@cloughTransitiveReductionCitation2015]] have also shown that around 80% of citations are removed from arXiv citation networks through the process of transitive reduction (an extended version of the declustering algorithm used here).…”
