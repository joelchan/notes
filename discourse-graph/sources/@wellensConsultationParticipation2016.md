- Title:: From Consultation to Participation
- Author(s):: [[Lore Wellens]], [[Marc Jegers]]
- Abstract:: Empirical research in the literature on accountability of nonprofit organizations (NPOs) toward their beneficiaries is scarce, and the available studies have a number of limitations. Our study attempts to overcome some of them and focuses on one specific component of accountability toward beneficiaries: beneficiary impact on organizational decision making and output. Data were collected by surveying general managers of 790 Belgian NPOs in fourteen industries. Results show that most NPOs implement some mechanisms to involve beneficiaries and their representatives in organizational policy making, mechanisms that vary between and within industries. Despite the existence of such mechanisms, their perceived association with impact on policy making and associated potential organizational effects is weak, though positive.

    - eye-opening for Sarah because it connects with our findings: they're doing informal ways of engaging beneficiaries, but the informality has less of an impact (or said differently, puts an upper limit on beneficiaries' impact)

    - might be useful to search for some framing theories to help make sense of this

        - as an example, [[@orlikowskiUsingTechnologyConstituting2000]]'s [[technologies-in-practice]] lens might be really useful to think about the impact of PD in nonprofits as they are right now as you observe in your interviews in terms of their norms and interpretive schemes - what "PD-in-practice" might emerge if you just gave them PD tools and said "go off and be awesome"?
