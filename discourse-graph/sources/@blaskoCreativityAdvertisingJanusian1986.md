        - [[Janusian processes in creative thinking]] are mental processes "which simultaneously realize (originate, apprehend, resolve and express) the natural unity and harmony inherent in apparent opposites" (p. 44)

- Reflecting more on the [[dialectic]] conversation with [[Sue Borchardt]] (and referring back to [this quote](Farnsworth offers a novel encapsulation of what makes good writing good, whether in the King James Bible or the Gettysburg Address. He hypothesizes that ‚ÄúRhetorical power doesn‚Äôt come from just being clear or just being concise or by pushing in any other one direction. It‚Äôs usually created by some sort of push and pull, or in a word by contrasts.‚Äù Where a traditional style guide would emphasize shortness and simplicity as a means to writerly elegance, Farnsworth says its in the display of difference that writing becomes most fully engaging, with the union of oppositions, ‚Äúusually one of friction or contrast, between two things.‚Äù Illustration of this is provided when he analyzes the average sentence structure and length in the writing of Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, arguably the greatest American legal writer (and thus close to Farnsworth‚Äôs judicial attorney‚Äôs heart). While taking care to emphasize that sentence length should be varied, most contemporary style guides hew towards the mantra that shorter is better. Farnsworth compares two paragraphs of legal writing, one from Holmes and the other from the entirely more pedestrian writer (and man) Chief Justice William Rehnquist. What Farnsworth discovers isn‚Äôt that Holmes‚Äôs sentences are either shorter or longer on average than those of Rehnquist, rather Holmes‚Äôs shorter sentences are much shorter and his longer sentences are much longer. The consensus perspective might be that briefer sentences are preferable, and the oppositional pugilist might challenge that, but the reality is more nuanced‚Äîit was in the juxtaposition of such extremity, Farnsworth argues, that Holmes‚Äôs talents lay)) I'm reminded of the idea of [[Janusian processes in creative thinking]]: ((YORoMyBVp))[[@blaskoCreativityAdvertisingJanusian1986]]
