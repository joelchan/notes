        - first eval was retrospective, on annotated data, any sentence that wasn't in original annotation was deemed irrelevant (even though it might be), so likely to be pessimistic measure of performance

        - the [[supervised distant supervision]] is also a contribution that can be generalized from the particular domain / task, which is aimed at dealing with [[distant supervision]] situations where you think you might be able to "supervise" the mapper that will provide noisy labels for your dataset based on the external db

        - in a retrospective evaluation making predictions on 133 manually labeled articles, the [[supervised distant supervision]] approach achieved [[measure/precision]] scores of approximately .3 for population and intervention, and .14 for outcomes, for top 3

            - Advantage of [[supervised distant supervision]] only comes into play when considering top 10 and top 20 results ([[metric/recall]] is probably higher than baselines)

            - But, keep in mind that first eval was retrospective, on annotated data, any sentence that wasn't in original annotation was deemed irrelevant (even though it might be), so likely to be pessimistic measure of performance

        - in a prospective evaluation making predictions for 50 articles, and then having experts manually label the top 3 predictions from each system, the [[supervised distant supervision]] approach achieved [[measure/precision]] @3 scores of approximately .9 for all [[PICO frames]] elements

- TONs of great work in [[NLP]] tools for knowledge base construction and assisting with [[systematic review]]s; one prominent example is [[sys/RobotReviewer]] led by [[Byron Wallace]] -  two cornerstones: automated extraction of [[PICO frames]] (crucially, with grounding / [[context]] in specific text segments in full-text; method described in #[[@wallaceExtractingPICOSentences2016]], as well as automated estimation of "risk of bias"

    - NOTE: the existence of these (increasingly mature) systems is great for us, since:

        - in other words, our innovations will be about the *interface* with the human workflows, not the fundamental computational methods; the less we have to do on that front, the better!

        - they are quite cagey about being fully automated (rightly so!) (cf. #[[@oconnorStillMovingAutomation2019]])

        - we care about integrating these into existing workflows, not replacing human work

                - The primary goal of this half-day workshop is to bring together researchers from diverse fields who are interested in extracting and representing knowledge from scientific text, and/or applications or methods for improving access to and understanding of such knowledge. Such research includes, but is not limited to:

                - Methods in natural language processing and data mining for extracting and representing knowledge from scientific text (e.g. information extraction, entity normalization, discourse analysis, parsing, summarization, text generation, question answering, knowledge base construction, weak/distant supervision, crowdsourcing),

                - Applications of these methods to improving scientific knowledge discovery and/or understanding (e.g. automated literature review, search and recommender systems, techniques for data exploration and visualization),

                - Fairness (e.g. augmented or assistive paper reading, concept simplification, scientific education and literacy),

                - Science of science studies (in particular, studies that shed light on phenomena that can motivate future research in above-mentioned areas), and

                - Datasets, Resources (e.g. treebanks, knowledge bases), and Tools (e.g. software libraries, annotation interfaces) for conducting research in such areas.

                - We welcome research relevant to processing text in any domain of science (e.g. Biology, Medicine, Computer Science, Physics, Economics, Sociology, etc.) that can come from a variety of text sources (e.g. scholarly papers, surveys and technical reports, patents, tweets by scholars, blogs/tutorials, etc.)

- reminded today of [[sys/RobotReviewer]], which is evidence of the initial feasibility of obtaining hooks for [[context queries]], at least in the medical domain (see, e.g., [[@wallaceExtractingPICOSentences2016]])

    - they focus on extracting into very structured [[PICO frames]], with [[Risk of Bias scores]], very table-like

        - we can focus on extending this to more exploratory and heterogenous [[synthesis]] tasks
