        - Abstract

            - There is currently a gap between the rich and expressive collection of published biomedical [[ontologies]], and the natural language expression of biomedical papers consumed on a daily basis by scientific researchers. The purpose of this paper is to provide an open, shareable [structure]([[standards]]) for dynamic integration of biomedical domain ontologies with the scientific document, in the form of an [Annotation]([[annotation]]) Ontology (AO), thus closing this gap and enabling application of formal biomedical ontologies directly to the literature as it emerges.
