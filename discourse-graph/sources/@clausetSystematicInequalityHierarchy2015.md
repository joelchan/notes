        - Abstract

            - The faculty job market plays a fundamental role in shaping research priorities, educational outcomes, and career trajectories among scientists and institutions. However, a quantitative understanding of faculty hiring as a system is lacking. Using a simple technique to extract the institutional prestige ranking that best explains an observed faculty hiring network‚Äîwho hires whose graduates as faculty‚Äîwe present and analyze comprehensive placement data on nearly 19,000 regular faculty in three disparate disciplines. Across disciplines, we find that faculty hiring follows a common and steeply hierarchical structure that reflects profound social inequality. Furthermore, doctoral prestige alone better predicts ultimate placement than a U.S. News \& World Report rank, women generally place worse than men, and increased institutional prestige leads to increased faculty production, better faculty placement, and a more influential position within the discipline. These results advance our ability to quantify the influence of prestige in academia and shed new light on the academic system.

        - There were very strong prestige hierarchies in academic hiring networks amongst {{[[calc]]: 5032 + 9336 + 4556}} tenure-track faculty across {{[[calc]]: 205 + 112 + 144}} institutions in CS, business, and history in North America in ~2011-2013

            - ~80% of faculty were hired from ~25% of institutions (p. 2)

            - only ~10% of faculty placed at institutions more prestigious than their doctorate (p. 3)

            - ~75% of faculty in top 15% of institutions in the prestige hierarchy received their doctorate from within this group; only ~5% received their doctorate from below the top 25% in the prestige hierarchy (p. 4)
