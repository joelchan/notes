        - Summary

            - Reviews four #seminal works on [[communities of practice]], and notes their commonalities (but more importantly, also their significant divergences)

                - #[[@laveSituatedLearningLegitimate1991]]

                - #[[@brownOrganizationalLearningCommunitiesofPractice1991]]

                    - which builds mostly on data from #[[@orrTalkingMachinesEthnography1996]]

                - #[[@wengerCommunitiesPracticeLearning1999]]

                - #[[@wengerCultivatingCommunitiesPractice2002]]

                    - most practical, but [[Andrew Cox]] suggests that the idea of [[communities of practice]] here is fundamentally different from that in #[[@wengerCommunitiesPracticeLearning1999]]

            - Main #Claim :

                - There are very distinct "varieties" of the concept of [[communities of practice]], with very different theoretical and pragmatic implications - it's crucial to be clear about which variety you build on - papering over the distinctions will lead to confusion and watered-down impact of the concept on your work (p. 536)

        - Key dimensions of divergence

            - What is community?

            - What is practice?

                - Shared / **joint** enterprise, vs.

                    - If the latter, concept of [[occupational communities]] might be more apt
