- h/t [[Qian Yang]]'s shared annotated syllabus from her course on Designing AI Products and Services [[@yangDesignAIProducts2020]]

    - this also reminds me that I've had conversations about this before with [[Hernisa Kacorri]] and [[Eun Kyoung Choe]] - might be time to revisit this, with some concepts for feedback, maybe? Maybe collaborating with someone in the lab???

- [[@yangDesignAIProducts2020]] seems to be much more about the material properties of a finished ML component

    - whereas last semester, it was more about the essence of what should be taught, at a deeper level of knowledge than what seems to be shallower for designers

- [[@yangDesignAIProducts2020]] and the UX of AI stuff at [[CSCW2020]] seems to sometimes be more about designing the UX of the user interacting with the system that has ML in it (trust, recovering from errors, accountability, etc.)

    - we're not interested in this
