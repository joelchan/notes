    - #[[üìù lit-notes]]

        - Good intro to [[m/Participatory Action Research]] for [[HCI]]

        - What makes for good [[m/Participatory Action Research]]?

            - Trustworthiness, stemming from

                - Credibility

                    - Prolonged engagement enables Credibility, by giving enough time for key phenomena to emerge (p. 53)

                        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2Fs-qL8EwT8M.png?alt=media&token=9b916d4c-2736-4373-ba36-b552beb8f6d5)

                    - Persistent and explicit observation enables Credibility, by minimizing the distance between the phenomena and the observation (contra retrospective reports only, for example) (p. 53)

                        - An important subpoint of this is to emphasize the [[verbatim principle]], using and reporting as much direct quotes and participant concepts as possible

                        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F__xCYakqON.png?alt=media&token=ab3e62af-c3a3-495c-b457-e86f345238d3)

                    - Inclusion of multiple perspectives enables Credibility, by allowing data triangulation to occur

                        - This involves member checking and debriefing, as well as standpoint analysis

                        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FMh-VHSGLNZ.png?alt=media&token=52b88ada-3084-4b92-8221-5c0d772fd6ef)

                    - Workability of solutions enables Credibility

                        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FW2VJgZplxn.png?alt=media&token=330792c0-b3d3-4e77-8af6-52f70b45dddf)

                        - Note, however, that workability doesn't entail finding the "best" solution; rather, the goal is to create understanding from identifying "potentially better" solutions that create authentic improvements in the problematic situations of the community (p. 57)

                            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FdYM_l06c3P.png?alt=media&token=8c53cdb5-8199-41e6-9693-9be33bc15d68)

                - Transferability, supported by transparency in data collection and analysis (dependability) and sufficient volume of evidence so that others can confirm that the events transpired as described (confirmability)

                    - p. 53-54

                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FKLi6FdyBKZ.png?alt=media&token=43904689-1b92-4516-807e-d37969367eb7)

            - Process

                - Start with establishing relationship

                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FxUToQWtTsS.png?alt=media&token=afcce465-2803-4cb4-b796-9924a1d857a1)

                - After establishing relationship, collaboratively defined research questions and problems

                    - This involves developing vision and operation statements (p. 55-56)

                        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FMmXN69q-Qp.png?alt=media&token=f2301d2c-33e1-4ab2-8489-010d36459af9)

        - My questions:

            - What is the difference between [[m/Participatory Action Research]] and

            - Is there a particular time scale that works?

            - At what point do you set up an IRB? How do you describe the "procedures"?

            - I don't understand how this works: After establishing relationship, collaboratively defined research questions and problems

                - Need to see some examples
