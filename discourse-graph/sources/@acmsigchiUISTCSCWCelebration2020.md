        - 1980's

            - [[Irene Greif]]

                - Tension between the "Scandinavian" social science / design and technologists from the very beginning

                    - e.g., shift from 86 (first CSCW) to 88 (second CSCW, chaired by [[Lucy A. Suchman]])

                - [[Jonathan Grudin]] why groupware fails [[@grudinWhyCSCWApplications1988]]

                    - see also

                    - [[@schmidtRidingTigerComputer1991]], which argues with an evocative metaphor that supporting cooperative work is like riding a tiger!

                        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FgnlFAJ3LxR.png?alt=media&token=db2beae9-750e-4868-bdd8-985503f3341e)

                - Lotus Notes! From lab to commercial groupware!

                - [[Doug Engelbart]] - everything we'd talked about in CSCW he built in 1968

                    - impoant to see talk in 1986 on personal workstations

                        - frustrated: people didnt' wannt to talk the time to learn these wonderful systems

            - [[Wendy Mackay]]

                - [[std/Hypertext]]

                - DEC courses

                    - buy a computer and it would teach you how to use it

                - IBM PC

                - DEC interactive video system (DEC IVIS)

                - Project Athena

                - UIST was spin-off from SIGGRAPH bc they couldn't get SIGGRAPH to be interseted in interactions

        - 1990s

            - [[Jonathan Grudin]]

                - 1995 is major inflection point: move from small communities to large worldwide communities - rise of bad actors

                - beyond being there

                    - [[@hollanBeingThere1992]]

                - [[Doug Engelbart]] loved CSCW

                - Operation transform was from CSCW!

                - ECSCW

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FZdwEuqSvmu.png?alt=media&token=d926a937-bd85-4b6e-8244-46c97495048d)

            - [[Hiroshi Ishii]]

                - Many powerful ideas were demonstrated from the beginning

                - powerful concept of [[interpersonal distance]] - makes me think of [[[[CLM]] - Context and privacy are in tension when sharing knowledge with others]] and [[[[QUE]] - How can we best bridge private vs. public knowledge?]]

                    - --> [[D/Democratizing Design]]

        - 2000s

            - major theme: tangible, touch interfaces, multi-user collocated

            - e.g., [[terrotioriality in collaborative tabletop workspaces]]

            - [[lumisight]] --> innovative way to enable shared and private workspaces int he same tabletop interface

                - again cc [[[[CLM]] - Context and privacy are in tension when sharing knowledge with others]]

            - another theme: mobile devices

            - touchscreens (after iPhone released in 2007)

            - mobile as [[citizen science]] platform

            - [[web 2.0]] and social platforms

            - 2001 - debut of [[sys/Wikipedia]]

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2Fn78JV6VAgf.png?alt=media&token=dc00fd32-ba9a-47e4-bf9c-2c170bd6d51e)

            - people start studying communities on wikipedia!

            - [[Aniket Kittur]] is front and center

            - [[Aniket Kittur]]

            - [[crowdsourcing]] emerges as well (in the [[human computation]] flavor)

                - [[@vonahnLabelingImagesComputer2004]]

            - new social experiences, in part because of debut of [[Facebook]] in [[2004]]

                - majr change was the additino of the "wall" feature

                - and the "like" button

            - [[Digg]] in [[2004]], [[Reddit]] in [[2005]]

            - lesson for me: in [[CSCW]], long history of legitimate, impactful work studying affordances and behaviors in existing technologies, not necessarily only creating new prototype ones!

                - karrie says quite explicitly, [[CSCW]] begins to shift towards studying, away from building, and the split off to [[UIST]] begins

            - [[friendsourcing]] with [[sys/Collabio]]

        - 2010's [[Aniket Kittur]] and [[Jaime Teevan]]

            - recap of 2000 to 2010

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FjFm0zm5_6Z.png?alt=media&token=343db49b-d330-4f54-9fc4-fda312a9f956)

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FHxtarARD2K.png?alt=media&token=4ff9b9da-1f34-46a3-a9c9-0b2b08f27f37)

                - [[dataset/ImageNet]] emerges in [[2010]] - data at scale!

                - major theme then of the 2010s is "fragmented intelligence" - difficulty focusing, but also innovations to allow contributions that are small add up into something big

                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FS96azxB-tr.png?alt=media&token=c5ceec65-faaa-44d4-93f2-fc4a85955f31)

                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FDYffM_cQNc.png?alt=media&token=2858949b-9683-45d9-af6e-048b0bdf9d49)

                - so another big theme is the beginnings of [[Human-AI Interaction]], starting with machines learning from humans

        - 2020 and beyond with [[Amy Zhang]] and [[Niloufar Salehi]]

            - themes

                - how to engage with human and societal values more directly in our research questions?

                    - people in CSCW already working on this, but could focus more!

                - unique role as researchers (vs. commercial systems)?

                - reconsidering our approach ([56:01](https://youtu.be/4oFD_VKGp78?t=3361))

                    - shuld we design?

                    - recondsider focus on novelty

                    - many themes connecting here to [[[[CLM]] - Prevailing incentives in academia are bad for science]]

            - highlights

        - Q&A

            - [[Irene Greif]] notes that [[lotus notes]], for example, is an example of value coming to business/industry from user studies

            - major reiteration of the theme about [incentives]([[[[CLM]] - Prevailing incentives in academia are bad for science]]), and connecting that to our collective failure to anticipate harms (h/t [[Aniket Kittur]]): we just don't incentivize enough the kind of work that could uncover and deal with these harms (not enough scale, not enough real users and fidelity of systems to be used with enough reality to uncover bad uses, harms, etc.)

                - unfortunately this part of the Q&A was cutoff in the recording :(

            - how do we go beyond beyond being there?

                - [[@hollanBeingThere1992]]

            - questions from slider

                - Have we done a good job of going beyond being there? What's worked well, where have we fallen short, and what are the major remaining/ongoing challenges?

                - Many of the mentioned most impactful work were commercial systems from companies and industry labs. What is the role of academia vs. industry in innovation at the intersection of UIST+CSCW?

                - There have been profound negative effects from our collective community's research enabling the advancement of interactive, social media, & exploitive crowdsourcing platforms, accelerating rips in the social fabric. How do we atone for, and rectify, these harmful impacts going forward?

                - Many of the technologies of the 2000s up until today have brought great good but are also causing big harms to society. Where have we failed to see this and intervene when it was still possible?

                - The trusting environment when CSCW and UIST were born seems very different than the current divisive environment (fueled in part by connected, mobile devices). How should we shape our collective future?

                - It seems that the early impactful systems and studies were more relevant and interconnected (e.g., they inspired and complemented each other to push our field forward). It seems less so in current years. What are we missing?  (edited)

                - On slowing down: as our community grows, more of us means we collectively can spend more time and thought on an individual question without slowing down the field. How might we create collective rather than individual incentive structures?

                - These trends suggest the need to change how CS is taught - social, psychological, design, ... what is the role of the CSCW + UIST communities in contributing to/shaping these much-needed (?) transformations?

                - Where *should* CSCW/UIST research move to create equitable futures?

                - Tech/vision-driven innovation (UIST style) vs. needs/social-driven innovation (CSCW style)? Please consider: 1) cultures beyond America/Europe & 2) the major physical limits humanity has started facing.

                - A lot of interesting research prototypes about video conferencing in cscw in 90s, where are they now? What do you think about today's video conferencing systems? How about clowdr (used in cscw2020 now )?   (edited)

                - One of the panelists mentioned the divergence of UIST and CSCW in the 2000s. How do we reverse that divergence? How do we fight the forces that caused them in the first place?

                - All this talking is beautiful, but academia will only impact the real world more than industry does when we stop doing things like wizard of oz and focus on developing complete systems that are ready (or very close) to be deployed---which will never happen if we keep prioritizing publication numbers

                - About the shift from the trusting homogeneous community to today, if we we work in trusting homogenous labs, think about possible unintended consequences of our work when others appropriate it.

                - Responses: Early CSCW was mainly attended by industry, academic participation increased in the late 90s. The video systems of the 80s and 90s did not lead to successful products, though many of the features showed up in Skype and Zoom in the 2005-2020. A history of video would be interesting.

                - "Technology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral." Look back at these technologies. What are they? Is technology is getting humans to work?

                - The elephant in the room: how do we deal with the fact that we created the very technologies (social networks, recommender systems, crowdsourcing, ...) that are being used, among other things, to destroy the fabric of democracy.

                - How come none of the innovative features created in the 90' for mediaspaces have made it into commercial systems like Zoom et al.?

                - Seeing a trend of CSCW from telecommunication to co-located collaboration?

        - A quick tweet-able summary

            - Some major highlights

                - Amazing to see so many

                - Wonder about mismatches between our incentive systems and ways of doing this work and the challenges we're facing now

                - Early days had tons of wonderful prototype interactions and systems that found their way into commercial products

                - But we were beginning to see from the beginning the dangers of trying to design systems without sufficient time and usage to see it break down

                    - [[@grudinWhyCSCWApplications1988]]

                - We're now, I think, reaping hte fruits of an incentive system that is still tuned to the "small, homogenous", not necessarily by design, but by effect:

                    - plug for the [[short-termism]] blog post:

                - TYhis is a larger discussion than our own community - it's a science-wide thing

                - I'm hopeful for the future that this is now a mainstream discussion point

                - Want to highligyht one particuarly insightful reframing fo the question: On slowing down: as our community grows, more of us means we collectively can spend more time and thought on an individual question without slowing down the field. How might we create collective rather than individual incentive structures?

                - A version of this happened with the high-energy physics community, and now in bio as well, and more recently, efforts like [[Many Labs]]: what might we do in HCI that's similar?
