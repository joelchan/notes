        - Abstract

            - Many thanks to our Presenting Sponsor, The University of Oregon - White Stag Block.

            - Ward is best known as the inventor of wiki technology. Now, as the Nike Open Data Fellow, he has set out to change the world by doing for numbers what he's done for words: use technology to give them depth and meaning that ordinary people can depend on every day.

            - TEDx

            - Established in 2009, in the spirit of "ideas worth spreading," TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TED.com videos, live speakers and performers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized. Over 1,400 TEDx events occur annually around the world.
