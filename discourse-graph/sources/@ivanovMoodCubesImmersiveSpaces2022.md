“…Here, images might be thought of as artefacts to be gathered and manipulated, combined and annotated. Ways of supporting these activities have been highlighted before; our findings are in line with analyses of the ways in which existing tools, such as mood boards, are used ([Lucero, 2012]([[@luceroFramingAligningParadoxing2012]])), as well with recommendations that highlight the need to support the management and laying out of collected examples ([Keller et al, 2009]([[@kellerCollectingCabinetHow2009]]);[Mendels et al, 2011]([[@mendelsFreedSystemCreating2011]])) and their flexible annotation ([Herring et al, 2009]([[@herringGettingInspiredUnderstanding2009]]);[Sharmin et al, 2009]([[@sharminUnderstandingKnowledgeManagement2009b]])). We will not reiterate those arguments here.…”
