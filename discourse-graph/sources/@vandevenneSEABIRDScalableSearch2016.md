        - Abstract

            - As more and more people are increasingly turning to nature for design inspiration, tools and methodologies are developed to support the systematic bioideation process. State-of-the-art approaches struggle with expanding their knowledge bases because of interactive work required by humans per biological strategy. As an answer to this persistent challenge, a scalable search for systematic biologically inspired design (SEABIRD) system is proposed. This system leverages experience from the product aspects in design by analogy tool that identifies candidate products for between-domain design by analogy. SEABIRD is based on two conceptual representations, product and organism aspects, extracted from, respectively, a patent and a biological database, that enable leveraging the ever growing body of natural-language biological texts in the systematic bioinspired design process by eliminating interactive work by humans during corpus expansion. SEABIRD's search is illustrated and validated with three well-known biologically inspired design cases.

[[sysproduct aspect analysis]]

- looking at description in [[@vandevenneSEABIRDScalableSearch2016]], in section 3.3 (p. 85)

    - it's essentially a variant of [[m/Principal Components Analysis]] (very similar in some ways to [[m/Latent Semantic Analysis]]), where principal components are extracted from a term-document matrix
