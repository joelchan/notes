        - Abstract

            - This paper addresses the ways AI ethics research operates on an ideology of ideal theory, in the sense discussed by Mills (2005) and recently applied to AI ethics by Fazelpour \& Lipton (2020). I address the structural and methodological conditions that attract AI ethics researchers to ideal theorizing, and the consequences this approach has for the quality and future of our research community. Finally, I discuss the possibilities for a nonideal future in AI ethics.

    - Generally relevant to our [sense](There is also a potential connection here to [[P/Material Knowledge of ML for Design]], in that an [[explainable AI]]-heavy approach has such an emphasis on rigor that it feels "science-y", in contrast to a much more [conversation with the design material]([[Reflective Conversation with the Design Material]]) flavor of [[material knowledge]]) of the contrast between [[explainable AI]] and a more "designerly" [[material knowledge]] angle on the issue of [[FATML]]
