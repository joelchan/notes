        - Abstract

            - Abstract: Many cognitive processes contribute to the generation of novel problem solutions. One important process involves the combination and reorganization of extant knowledge structures. The present study provided empirical evidence for the significance of this process. Subjects were presented with exemplars drawn from multiple a priori categories. They were asked to (a) combine these a priori categories to generate a new category, (b) provide exemplars of the elements included in this category, and (c) write a story involving this category. The quality and originality of these products was evaluated under conditions where the relatedness of the a priori categories was varied along with exemplar typicality and instructional set. It was found that category relationships and instructional set influenced solution quality and originality. The implications of these findings for understanding creative problem solving and the category combination process were considered
