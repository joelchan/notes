- re-reading [[@starInstitutionalEcologyTranslations1989]] and recalling the [core motivation](per [[[[PTN]] - boundary object]]s, meant to strike a balance between the extremes of [too much](((L5b1tSbi2))) and [too little](((i0p-3Ud6n))) structure) of [[[[PTN]] - boundary object]]s for the [[[[PTN]] - discourse graph]]'s design; in particular, of the four types of boundary objects they identified in the Museum, the "ideal type" seems to fit the most:

    - > This is an object such as a diagram, atlas or other description which in fact does not accurately describe the details of any one locality or thing. It is abstracted from all domains, and maybe fairly vague. However, it is adaptable to a local site precisely because it is fairly vague; ^^it serves as a means of communicating and cooperating symbolically- a 'good enough' road map for all parties^^. An example of an ideal type is the species. This is a concept which in fact described no specimen, which incorporated both concrete and theoretical data and which served as a means of communicating across both worlds. Ideal types arise with differences in degree of abstraction. They result in the deletion of local contingencies from the common object and have the advantage of adaptability. ([[@starInstitutionalEcologyTranslations1989]], p. 410)

    - our field studies have made clear that people desire a lot more local control and fine-grained nuance in their local models. yet these distinctions may not always be relevant or understandable to others.

    - our core motivation is not just local, individual synthesis, but a protocol that can respect [[epistemological diversity]], and facilitate cross-talk and synthesis across disciplines

    - the "paper" is a good boundary object on some notes, but when translated locally begins to run afoul of a lot of the contextual requirements

    - [[[[PTN]] - boundary object]]s derive part of their power (for facilitating cross-organizational/boundary coordination and work) by being "weakly structured in common use, and strongly structured in specific use"
