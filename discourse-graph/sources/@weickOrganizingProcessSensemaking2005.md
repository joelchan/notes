- Organizational sensemaking as a potential frame from [[@weickOrganizingProcessSensemaking2005]] (a whole different parallel world in org sci, 8k cites!! on [[ðŸ§± sensemaking]])

    - [[@valeauReassessmentRoleRankandFile2019]] uses this frame to argue that how nonprofits view their mission and how they view their clients are not easily changeable things - they're tightly bound together into an identity-driven sensemaking frame

    - this might give additional significance to sarah's observations about how her Ss mentioned mission drift/creep, and also talked about their clients in particular ways (e.g., don't want to burden them)
