        - Abstract

            - Iteration can help people improve ideas. It can also give rise to fixation, continuously refining one option without considering others. Does creating and receiving feedback on multiple prototypes in parallel, as opposed to serially, affect learning, self-efficacy, and design exploration? An experiment manipulated whether independent novice designers created graphic Web advertisements in parallel or in series. Serial participants received descriptive critique directly after each prototype. Parallel participants created multiple prototypes before receiving feedback. As measured by click-through data and expert ratings, ads created in the Parallel condition significantly outperformed those from the Serial condition. Moreover, independent raters found Parallel prototypes to be more diverse. Parallel participants also reported a larger increase in task-specific self-confidence. This article outlines a theoretical foundation for why parallel prototyping produces better design results and discusses the implications for design education.

- This makes me think of [[@dowParallelPrototypingLeads2010]]

    - There, the parallel mechanism is more about enabling less attachment to particular parts of the solution space

- this seems similar to what is found in [[@dowParallelPrototypingLeads2010]].

        - StudyDesign:: between-subjects design: serial vs. parallel prototyping structure

        - Procedure:: ~150 mins total, ~10 mins to create each prototype. Main difference is whether get critique from ad expert (experimenter) after each prototype (serial), or after three prototypes (parallel). Experimenter critiques drew from a pre-created list of critique statements for consistency across participants

        - There were also effects on self-efficacy, but I'm not sure if this is of direct interest to us for this question

            - Perhaps it is indirectly related to mechanisms of [[ðŸ§± fixation]], but... again, this is about ideas that were generated by *you*, vs. given to you as examples

                - Although this does suggest some additional ideas around the framing of the *source* of those ideas

                - In the BO studies, the examples include both the design and its "performance". this is not always present in human experiments

    - # General notes

        - hypothesis;

            - parallel --> comparison --> better model of underlying space

                - this is the [[gestalt]] idea. in a sense, making the designer more [[Bayesian Optimizer]] like

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FUI8MQpJJxd.png?alt=media&token=2ddf9995-2066-4d4e-a849-dab2847bfdee) (p. 4)

            - parallel --> generative vs. evaluative task framing --> more exploration/divergence

                - this seems similar to the [[ðŸ§± fixation]] route

            - third hypothesis about changing framing of feedback towards process rather than self is interesting, but not for our core question here

        - what's interesting about serial vs. parallel is the very obvious relationship to simple design questions: do we give you a "drip"? a list? or something else?

        - #[[âž° breadcrumbs]] for next time:

            - [[@dowPrototypingDynamicsSharing2011]] follow-up work gets closer to our paradigm of examples: possible finding that sharing multiple instead of one leads to better inspiration (more integration, more diverse exploration)
