        - Abstract

            - This essay contributes a meta-scientific account of human–computer interaction (HCI) research as problem-solving. We build on the philosophy of Larry Laudan, who develops problem and solution as the foundational concepts of science. We argue that most HCI research is about three main types of problem: empirical, conceptual, and constructive. We elaborate upon Laudan’s concept of problem-solving capacity as a universal criterion for determining the progress of solutions (outcomes): Instead of asking whether research is ‘valid’ or follows the ‘right’ approach, it urges us to ask how its solutions advance our capacity to solve important problems in human use of computers. This offers a rich, generative, and ‘discipline-free’ view of HCI and resolves some existing debates about what HCI is or should be. It may also help unify efforts across nominally disparate traditions in empirical research, theory, design, and engineering.

        - > Even if HCI puts strong emphasis on construction, its conceptual work has not been powerful enough to drive it. We can carry out ever more sophisticated studies, with larger samples and more complex set-up, ad infinitum, but without conceptual contributions that link empirical findings and the design of technology, the results will remain unactionable. From a problem-solving perspective, without conceptual ‘glue’ to anchor them, constructive contributions readily remain point designs and empirical studies point studies (p. 4962)

- This is reminiscent of the conceptual gap that [[@oulasvirtaHCIResearchProblemSolving2016]] identifies between the empirical and constructive knowledge bases in HCI:
