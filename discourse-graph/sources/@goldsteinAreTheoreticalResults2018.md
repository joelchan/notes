- [[@marderTheoreticalMusings2020]] leads to wonderful rabbit-hole and find of this paper that does a "worked example" of how to better interleave theory and data in papers: [[@goldsteinAreTheoreticalResults2018]]

    - and also reflecting on the aberrant emphasis on data > theory in bio

        - maybe fits with stuff that [[Matthew Akamatsu]] has been saying about the undervaluing of [[synthesis]] in his field

    - talks about the need for the [[dialectic]] [[dance between the theoretical and the evidential]] that is foundational to the scientific method
