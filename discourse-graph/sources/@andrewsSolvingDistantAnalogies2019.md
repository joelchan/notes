- Title:: Solving distant analogies reduces belief-based responding in transitive inference
- Author(s):: [[Glenda Andrews]], [[Damian M. Vann]]
- Abstract:: Previous research demonstrated that relational processing in transitive inference problems can be disrupted by belief-based content. Given the premises, The horse is larger than the goat, and The goat is larger than the elephant, accepting the valid conclusion, The horse is larger than the elephant suggests use of relational processing whereas accepting the invalid conclusion The elephant is larger than the horse indicates belief-based responding. This research examined whether solving analogies inﬂuenced participants’ reliance on belief-based or relational processing. Participants generated solutions to either distant analogies (e.g. nose:scent::antenna: ______) or near analogies (e.g. nose:scent::tongue:______) before evaluating the conclusions of transitive inference problems that were valid (V) or invalid (I) and believable (B), unbelievable (U) or neutral (N). Solving distant analogies eliminated belief-based responding (possibly reﬂecting improved inhibitory control) and facilitated relational responding on VU problems.

    - 67 participants 34 male and 33 female at Griffith university partook in the study

    - Participants were given a fluid intelligence test before the analogy study

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FbHiU1h0mKq.png?alt=media&token=e67b2f73-ade8-43b9-9a10-5ef08538e622) (Pg 3)

    - Analogies were sourced from another study and participants were given practice analogies before being asked to solve as many as the 38 remaining analogies in 15 minutes

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FS8LvR4KU81.png?alt=media&token=01fa63be-2ff4-435f-832f-434bae0dcb66) (Pg 3)

    - Participants were then given a transitive inference task containing 5 term transitive inference problems

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F1ncq9Bz_2n.png?alt=media&token=3ed07f8b-2fb6-433e-888f-7a5829ab2e2c) (pg 4)

    - answers fell into one of six categories valid believable, valid unbelievable, valid neutral,  invalid neutral, invalid believable, invalid unbelievable

    - Participants were provided 4 premises on a screen and told to accept them as true. Once 20 seconds had passed or they had pressed the spacebar the screen would display the conclusion and participants pressed yes or no to accept or reject the conclusion

- Results

    - Belief problem results

        - Participants in the near analogy group solved more analogies correctly than the far analogy group

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FSsdvSxywwX.png?alt=media&token=3a93ae3a-cefe-4b16-9575-1c5ad75369a2) (Pg 5)

        - In the near analogy group the participants were statistically more likely to accept believable as opposed to unbelievable

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FKkuEToKpr3.png?alt=media&token=89732354-37e7-4225-bedc-19dca598c56c) (Pg 5)

        - the distant analogy group accepted more unbelievable conclusion than the near analogy group

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2Fq5sSgMiJVb.png?alt=media&token=b46792f0-82c2-4f0e-b20f-78a4c07f74cd) (Pg 5)

        - reading times were longer in the distant analogy group than the near analogy group, in addition to being longer during invalid conclusions

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FRpSRAHWTPQ.png?alt=media&token=bcc8b1e3-3de2-4fc4-8ffc-6159368bc2a6) (Pg 5)

        - Confidences were higher in the distant analogy group

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FConTRJri-6.png?alt=media&token=e9f106bf-64ce-43e9-acca-08e4c4d01532) (Pg 6)

    - Neutral problem results

        - When interacting with neutral content there was a higher acceptance rate of valid neutral problems over invalid neutral problems.

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F4ZhTTWLVFS.png?alt=media&token=c0416284-648b-47d7-8305-cf384e2f8f2b) (Pg 6)

        - Again they found that reading times were longer in the distant analogy groups then the near analogy group.

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F-60naHzNg-.png?alt=media&token=ce70bdc9-c1a6-4a54-9040-7a58f5b6b3c3) (Pg 6)

        - in relation to valid neutral problems the distant analogy group had more confidence when answering valid neutral problems than the near analogy group. The invalid neutral problems did not yield a statistically relevant result.

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FJ6tVGScQB-.png?alt=media&token=e3a80fd9-3c70-4997-889b-5af49c049800) (Pg 6)

    - Fluid intelligence results

        - The fluid intelligence tests revealed a positive correlation between acceptance of valid unbelievable conclusions in the near analogy group, but not in the far analogy group.

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FzuKI5lWxEu.png?alt=media&token=76e8bab9-5e70-47f2-ad71-41ff20a352c6) (Pg 6)
- reinforces [[@vendettiFarOutThinkingGenerating2014]] solving distant analogies reduces the fluid intelligence required solve tasks provided after solving them.
