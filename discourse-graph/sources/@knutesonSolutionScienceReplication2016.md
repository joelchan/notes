    - #lit-context

        - Author ([[Bruce Knuteson]]) is now CEO of the [[sys/KN-X]] for-profit company, but used to be a TTK faculty at MIT in physics, and then was a hedge fund quant on Wall St. Background described here

    - #[[üìù lit-notes]]

        - Describes a literal marketplace of ideas, where knowledge-havers sell information to knowledge-seekers.

            - System ([[sys/KN-X]]) is deployed here: https://www.kn-x.com/

            - More accessible description here: https://www.kn-x.com/static/PWFeb17forum.pdf

        - Crucially, knowledge-havers have "skin in the game", because they **lose real money** if the information they provide turns out to be false

        - The concept is intriguing, but the execution at the moment focuses very narrowly on information that can be verified quite unambiguously

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F-7yiAOOt7c.png?alt=media&token=f13506da-bf76-40ab-9dfa-0bf4d1ecf68f)

            - I wonder how the system's incentives are robust (or not) to information that is harder (or takes longer) to verify, or which may never actually be verified in terms of truth claims?

                - Could we generalize this concept to cover claims that are less about truth and more about "value"? Usefulness? Not sure...

                - If not, seems limited, but still very valuable as a piece of the overall puzzle!!

        - Generally, I'm intrigued by these folks who were traditionally very successful in academia, but left to continue working on big problems. First one I knew of was [[Michael Nielsen]], then [[David Chapman]] and [[Benjamin Reinhardt]], and now this person.
