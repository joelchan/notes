        - Abstract

            - The field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) aims at securing a lasting impact for technology-based interventions in the context of social inequities. Increasingly, HCI scholars are proposing assets-based design as an effective approach towards this issue. Rather than starting from people's needs and deficits, this approach posits that design should start from a deep understanding of people's assets. A pending issue, however, is how to account for the situated nature of assets; that is, how to decide which asset to leverage and for what design purpose. Drawing from cultural sociology and shifting the emphasis from assets to capacities, we propose Swidler's theory of culture-in-action as an analytical lens for unpacking the complex relationship between capacities, goals, and structural limitations. Leveraging findings from a Participatory Design engagement with 35 Latino immigrant parents for envisioning parent-education technologies, we demonstrate the applicability of this lens. We contribute to HCI scholarship by further discussing 1) how to analyze capacities' design potential, and 2) the methodological particularities for collecting them.

        - stage 2: design via [[m/Fictional inquiry]]

    - observations/learnings:

        - ppl from disenfranchised groups may need help/time to see themselves as having valuable assets/capacities

            - not sure if grounded in specific observations here

            - but can follow up on cites

        - conflict seemed productive, and they wanted more of it, for deeply eliciting situated capacities of participants (be careful, we don't see this in the data)

            - reminded of [[Agonistic Participatory Design]]

        - [[m/Fictional inquiry]], particularly with some degree of emotional distance, seemed to help participants feel more comfortable, able to elicit more talk of capacities

        - [[culture-in-action]] lens as a powerful way to break through [layers of interpretation]([[[[CLM]] - There is a tension between analyzing participants' direct inputs, and respecting their actual insights (vs. designers' interpretation) that is intensified when working with design partners who struggle to contribute more directly to design artifacts]]), and get to a deep understanding of capacities and assets, crucial for [[asset-based design]]

            - [[Elizabeth Bonsignore]]: overcomes typical interpretation and analysis of "data" in terms of deficits ("Manifest Destiny")

            - p2 section on culture-in-actino unpacks this

            - p5 says how they used it in a three-step process

            - pp6-8 (section on "An Analysis of Parents' Situated Capacities")

                - e.g., implicit claim is that they wouldn't be able to see the richness of capacities behind the "closeness" thing without the culture-in-action lens

    - discussion:

        - [[Elizabeth Bonsignore]] wonders what would happen if we went back to the parents with a culture-in-action analysis: what if it didn't resonate at all? are we speaking for them!

            - cc P6 from [[Salma Elsayed-Ali]]'s paper:

                - > P6: "You start to tie some of those ideas together and then you immediately go back to the group while they're there and ask, you know, do these makes sense? Am I even in the right direction?"
