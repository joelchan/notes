        - Abstract

            - For almost half a century, Paul Meehl educated psychologists about how the mindless use of null-hypothesis significance tests made research on theories in the social sciences basically uninterpretable. In response to the replication crisis, reforms in psychology have focused on formalizing procedures for testing hypotheses. These reforms were necessary and influential. However, as an unexpected consequence, psychological scientists have begun to realize that they may not be ready to test hypotheses. Forcing researchers to prematurely test hypotheses before they have established a sound "derivation chain" between test and theory is counterproductive. Instead, various nonconfirmatory research activities should be used to obtain the inputs necessary to make hypothesis tests informative. Before testing hypotheses, researchers should spend more time forming concepts, developing valid measures, establishing the causal relationships between concepts and the functional form of those relationships, and identifying boundary conditions and auxiliary assumptions. Providing these inputs should be recognized and incentivized as a crucial goal in itself. In this article, we discuss how shifting the focus to nonconfirmatory research can tie together many loose ends of psychology's reform movement and help us to develop strong, testable theories, as Paul Meehl urged.

    - this one in particular has some really nice reflections on the notion of a [[deductive chain]] that precedes hypothesis testing - a lot of the core activities that help strengthen the deductive chain can be thought of as [[synthesis]]

        - this pairs nicely with [[@vanrooijTheoryTestHow2021]] in specifying heuristics and moves for theory-building, which... I think is a nice fit for [[[[PTN]] - discourse graph]] and [[context queries]]

            - how nice if we had tools and systems (with data!) that allowed us to explore these, in a somewhat analogous way to photoshop (exploring variants), simulations, statistical software, and other tools for thought.

            - what are the tools for synthesis?

                - as I've said in the past [[[[CLM]] - Effective individual synthesis systems (seem to mostly) exist (for a select few)]]

                    - the critical problem, though is this: because they're so individual, everyone is effectively an island. what if you don't have?

                    - a small exception, again, is sofware for [[systematic review]]s, but again, this doesn't solve our problem, bc so much [[synthesis]] that we want to do goes far beyond [[RCT]]s

                        - plus, they're often, afaict, "use once", not really supporting [[interoperability]] [[@oconnorStillMovingAutomation2019]] and [[reuse]] [[@blakeCollaborativeInformationSynthesis2006a]]

    - FWIW, the first criticism, that it isn't as closely tied to mathematization and formalization as the reviewer would like, is to me a bit of a strength!

- All of this I think circles back to the forceful points that [[@scheelWhyHypothesisTesters2020]] make about what is necessary in order to get to a place where we're comfortable designing experiments, which implicitly or explicitly employ some kind of formalism or "map"/ [ontology]([[ontologies]])

    - one of the key things they prescribe as [part of theory-building](![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FzlLsk8z23g.png?alt=media&token=9e7cd594-9fe8-443e-875d-afbfef05a9ac)) BEFORE we start worrying about preregistration and really precise, strong experiments, is precisely **concept formation**

- One thing I'm thinking about, still inspired by [[@vanrooijTheoryTestHow2021]] and [[@scheelWhyHypothesisTesters2020]] is to really dig into what the main concepts and [[explananda]] are here

    - In the past I've tended to use examples for exposition, with the "real meat" being the theory and experiments

    - But that's exactly backwards! The phenomena always need to be absolutely FRONT AND CENTER, driving the whole process from the get-go

    - In this case, I want to pay attention to subtle differences in mechanisms/patterns: direct borrowing of a solution (classical [[@gickAnalogicalProblemSolving1980]] style), flavor of [[bricolage]], probably easier lift, vs. more [indirect pathways of inspiration]([[[[CLM]] - A significant proportion of the benefits of analogical stimuli is oblique or indirect]])
