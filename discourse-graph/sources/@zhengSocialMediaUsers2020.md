        - Abstract

            - Social media has become an important platform for users to share information in recent years. A large number of active users are sharing their daily lives and social issues in various platforms. At the same time, an interesting phenomenon is that functions like 'three days visible' and 'selected contacts visible' are also popular among users. In order to explore the information sharing behavior from the perspective of why users set these limits, we made a 15-day observation on 21 college students' sharing behavior on WeChat Moments and conducted in-depth interviews with 16 of them. The study summarizes the characteristics of users who set different types of limits from the observation. Sixteen factors influencing the behavior of setting limits were identified and categorized into three dimensions: social, psychological and technical.
