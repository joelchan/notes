    - One thing that is important to take away from their paper is that experts aren't doing all their work in [[direct manipulation]] paradigms (cf. canvases), but neither are tehy doing programming entirely. They do a wonderful deep dive intot he affordances of each paradimg: e.g., DM for faster feedback and global control; PL for abstraction and local control

- Important new paper from [[Katherine Ye]] and [[Chinmay Kulkarni]] and the [[sys/Penrose]] group diving deep into how experts create conceptual diagrams [[@maayanHowDomainExperts2020]]

    - Remember [[Robert Horn]] and the connectino between #synthesis and visual diagrams.
