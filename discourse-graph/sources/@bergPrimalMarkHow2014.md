        - Abstract

            - While creative ideas are defined as both novel and useful, novelty and usefulness often diverge, making it difficult to develop ideas that are high in both. To explain this tradeoff between novelty and usefulness and how it can be overcome, this paper introduces the concept of the primal mark i.e., the first bit of content employees start with as they generate ideas, which anchors the trajectory of novelty and usefulness. In four experiments, participants started with primal marks that contained varying degrees of novelty. Results suggest that familiar primal marks foster usefulness at the expense of novelty, while new primal marks foster novelty at the expense of usefulness. However, the results also suggest a solution to this tradeoff: integrative primal marks that combine new and familiar content, fostering an optimal balance of novelty and usefulness. Implications for theory and research on creativity in organizations are discussed.

        - "novel primal marks" led to more novel but less useful ideas *initially*, but then when more familiar ideas were "infused", they ended up with better combinations of novelty and usefulness than starting out with familiar primal marks

        - "integrative primal marks" led to ideas that were more novel than familiar marks and more useful than novel primal marks, and had a higher "ceiling" of novelty and usefulness compared to either

            - shown in Experiment 4

        - possible implications

            - It's easier to improve on feasibility/practicality/usefulness than it is to improve on novelty

                - Or: novelty anchors are stickier (less elastic) than usefulness anchors
