        - Abstract

            - While creative ideas are defined as both novel and useful, novelty and usefulness often diverge, making it difficult to develop ideas that are high in both. To explain this tradeoff between novelty and usefulness and how it can be overcome, this paper introduces the concept of the primal mark i.e., the first bit of content employees start with as they generate ideas, which anchors the trajectory of novelty and usefulness. In four experiments, participants started with primal marks that contained varying degrees of novelty. Results suggest that familiar primal marks foster usefulness at the expense of novelty, while new primal marks foster novelty at the expense of usefulness. However, the results also suggest a solution to this tradeoff: integrative primal marks that combine new and familiar content, fostering an optimal balance of novelty and usefulness. Implications for theory and research on creativity in organizations are discussed.

        - "novel primal marks" led to more novel but less useful ideas *initially*, but then when more familiar ideas were "infused", they ended up with better combinations of novelty and usefulness than starting out with familiar primal marks

        - "integrative primal marks" led to ideas that were more novel than familiar marks and more useful than novel primal marks, and had a higher "ceiling" of novelty and usefulness compared to either

            - shown in Experiment 4

        - possible implications

            - It's easier to improve on feasibility/practicality/usefulness than it is to improve on novelty

                - Or: novelty anchors are stickier (less elastic) than usefulness anchors

- Remind me also of [[@bergPrimalMarkHow2014]]: fun paper on anchoring of novelty vs. feasibility (authors use the weird language of "primal mark", but the idea is in anchoring/priming).

    - TL;DR, it was harder to increase novelty (and therefore lower ceiling on creativity) if we anchored in feasibility and infused with novelty later, than it was to start with novelty, then infuse feasibility later. reminds me very much of the pattern of intuitive leaps first, then backfilling later with more analytic thinking. #[[➰ breadcrumbs]]

    - idea of following study: creating two heatmaps, one for novelty and one for usefulness which have different but related distributions (inspired by trade-off between novelty and usefulness)

    - primal marks: starting points; infusion: following actions

    - decouple creativity into novelty and usefulness

        - some analogies which might not be useful: diversity -> novelty; appropriateness -> usefulness; analogy from business and marketing domain: product-market fit, where novelty -> product, usefulness -> market

            - The insights provided by this analogy is that in real-world setting, companies might need to produce MVPs to test the usefulness in front of audience. For our heatmap study, the position of cell might represent novelty (how many people will reach to that cell) and the value of each cell might represent the usefulness.

        - hypotheses of how three mechanisms (levels) of inspiration affect novelty and usefulness respectively

            - explore: novelty

            - integrate: novelty (by adding novel features to common ideas) and usefulness (by adding common features to novel ideas)

            - model: novelty and usefulness

    - Results suggest that on average, familiar primal marks yield more useful but less novel ideas, while new primal marks yield more novel but less useful ideas. Integrative primal marks, however, have the best chance of yielding novel and useful ideas.

    - How integrating could contribute to creativity: "Furthermore, models of the creative process typically posit that emerging ideas become creative ideas through many iterative cycles of elaboration, incubation, and evaluation (Amabile, 1996; Lubart, 2001). An implicit assumption underlying these models is that emerging ideas can become more creative as they are elaborated and refined with additional content."

    - Favoring novelty over usefulness early in creative tasks may lead to a temporary tradeoff between the two, but allow for the tradeoff to be overcome in the end (with continuous familiar/useful inputs through the process).

    - Some thoughts

        - Previously we mainly consider the relationship among multiple examples (diversity among examples) but not consider the individual features of examples corresponding to the cognition of designers, such as novelty. Examples with higher diversity might have a higher chance to include more novel "primal marks". While examples with lower diversity could also be novel (all of them are primal marks), and anchor the designer in the "novelty" dimension; while the trade-off is reducing usefulness. Therefore, providing diverse inputs (integrative primal marks) early in creative tasks seems more promising than similar inputs.

        - For the heatmap study, the default starting point could be the "familiar primal mark" .

    - Relatedly: "integrative primal marks" led to ideas that were more novel than familiar marks and more useful than novel primal marks, and had a higher "ceiling" of novelty and usefulness compared to either
