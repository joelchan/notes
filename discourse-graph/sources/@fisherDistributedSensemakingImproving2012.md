        - Abstract

            - We examine the possibility of distributed sensemaking: improving a user's sensemaking by leveraging previous users' work without those users directly collaborating or even knowing one another. We asked users to engage in sensemaking by organizing and annotating web search results into "knowledge maps," either with or without previous users' maps to work from. We also recorded gaze patterns as users examined others' knowledge maps. Our findings show the conditions under which distributed sensemaking can improve sensemaking quality; that a user's sensemaking process is readily apparent to a subsequent user via a knowledge map; and that the organization of content was more useful to subsequent users than the content itself, especially when those users had differing goals. We discuss the role distributed sensemaking can play in schema induction by helping users make a mental model of an information space and make recommendations for new tool and system development.

            - ## results of interest and discussion

                - __One block for each result of interest. we'll refactor this together into EVD notes__

                    - ### summary

                        - __nest details and screenshots (e.g., key figures, quotes) under here__

                    - ### grounding context

                        - __block ref in major methods details from the source methods / context block we might need later to make sense of this result, particularly as they might conflict with others. __

                    - __also discuss possible critiques/claims. create source CLM notes for author conclusions (if you like), or reference other CLMs that we have that engage with this__

                - __Also can discuss meta-results (combinations of results) in a similar template.____

            - ## side notes

                - __Where are the authors coming from? Are there any useful "breadcrumbs" (e.g., other theoretical frameworks, authors, papers) we can follow up on?__
