        - Abstract

            - This article introduces the notion of [[design tensions]] as a paradigm. The concept of design tensions advances design decisions as a focus for analysis and reflection. It admits many paradigms of analysis but emphasizes the balancing of considerations in producing an entire system, emphasizing user or user group experience. This paradigm is presented in relationship to a particular design arena, the design of NetCalc, a system of handheld, wirelessly connected tools for math teaching/learning in classroom settings. Six intertwined project tensions are presented and explored for their technical, social, and cognitive antecedents and consequences, as they play out in relationship to achieving goals and system potential. Design tensions differ from design spaces in that they do not set boundaries or simplify the problem but rather provide a framework for creating a space of relevance.

    - #[[üìù lit-notes]]

        - design tensions and proejct tensions are used interchangeably

        - elements of a design tensions analysis:

            - Vision

            - Approach

            - Project Tensions

            - As Created Situations

        - proejct tensions are the most within the control of the designer

        - key function of [[design tensions]] is to help identify [[channel factors]]: " a few crucial emergent configurations that may make or break a system" (p. 417)

            - [[channel factors]] is a term from [[Kurt Lewin]]

        - main contrast is against [[design spaces]], which have an implicit/explicit assumption of independence in choices, which can obscure complex interrelatinoships bewteen dimensions of the design situation (often within/between social and technical aspects)

        - levels of concern

        - make a distinction between [[design tensions]] and tradeoffs

            - tradeoffs are one way to respond

- The concept of [[design tensions]] might be a useful analytical tool for sorting these out, which are actually under the potential agency of a design team [[@tatarDesignTensionsFramework2007]]

    - [[@harringtonDeconstructingCommunityBasedCollaborative2019]] actually build directly on this analytical framework to identify tensions along the way towards making more equitable [[Participatory Design]] approaches for engaging with vulnerable populations

    - another #example-of this is [[@gautamParticipatoryTensionsWorking2018]]
[[September 1st, 2020]]

- Thinking about [[@tatarDesignTensionsFramework2007]] again

    - Let's try it out for [[P: Mapping out Participation-Inclusion Tradeoffs in PD Methods]]

        - {{table}}

            - Vision

                - Is: "PD as a practice enacts substantial resource barriers to participation for many people"

                    - Ought: "It should be feasible to include as many types of people in PD as makes sense for a given problem"

            - Approach

                - Realities/constraints:

                    - Values:

            - Project Tensions

            - As Created Situations

    - The target of a [[design tensions]] analysis probably needs to be quite concrete - so PD in general is probably a bad target (too slippery and complex). As a heuristic: more concrete and bounded is probably more amenable to analysis. If we do this for, say, two concrete situations and compare, we can start to get at transferability or generalizability.

        - For this reason, if we haven't yet push too hard on recruiting, it might be best to focus on KidsTeam, and reflect on it with Greg, Beth B, Allison, and others who might be interested, in a design tensions framework.

        - The "mechanics" of this kind of project would involve iterating over the shared artfiact of the set of project tensions

    - [[design tensions]] seems like a productive lens for mapping!

        - they're almost a kind of "dimension reduction" or [[compression]] of a large design space into [[channel factors]]

    - I think the higher level stuff (the Vision and ((Nu-Q5Zi5b))) are more like constraints that "talk to" the project tensions. They're used somehow, but I'm not quite sure at this moment how.

    - One major risk of this project is that we'll not be able to go any deeper or more insightful than higher level platitudes about "participation is costly" and "not everyone can pay that cost"

        - We could also go further than simply identifying tensions by articulating observed As Created Situations (that create furthger tensions) from design decisions for the tensions

        - To head off this risk, we want to validate as quickly and cheaply as possible that at least one insight is possible and not yet articulated.

- the idea of "knots" reminds me very much of [[design tensions]] from [[@tatarDesignTensionsFramework2007]]

    - in these complex environments where the relevant and useful overall model is highly, highly situated and complex, drawing from a GIANT space of factors, it's more productive for [[synthesis]] to identify key sub-patterns that can be combined together into "knots" in specific situations, rather than an "overall integrated model" (a la physics)

        - this feels... right.
[[January 27th, 2022]]

- hmm a better one, more reminiscent of [[@tatarDesignTensionsFramework2007]], each side is +ve

    - {{table}}

        - **type of structure**

            - **low/delayed structure**

                - **high/upfront/as-you-go structure**

                    - **resolution??**

        - naming

            - keep things nimble, work at the speed of thought

                - ability to refer to things, collect, link easier, resume work

                    - deliberately fuzzy concepts you don't have to name until later
