            - The current version of the Nanopublication Guidelines includes a note suggesting that the guidelines be amended to state that an assertion published as a nanopublication should be ‚Äúa proposition that is falsifiable, that is to say we can test whether the proposition is true or false‚Äù ([Groth et al., 2013](http://www.nanopub.org/2013/WD-guidelines-20131215/)). Were this amendment to be made, PeriodO nanopublications would be in violation of the guidelines, as period definitions in PeriodO, like most of the information produced in the humanities, are neither testable nor falsifiable. Consider the assertion ‚Äúthere is a period called the Late Bronze Age in Northern Europe, and it lasted from about 1100 B.C. to 500 B.C.‚Äù The ‚ÄúLate Bronze Age‚Äù is a purely discursive construct. There was no discrete entity called the ‚ÄúLate Bronze Age‚Äù before it was named by those studying that time and place. Consequently, one cannot disprove the idea that there was a time period called the ‚ÄúLate Bronze Age‚Äù from around 1100 B.C. to 500 B.C.; one can only argue that another definition has more credence based on non-experimental, discursive arguments.

            - The proposed falsifiability requirement makes sense in certain contexts. Computational biologists, for example, wish to connect, consolidate, and assess trillions of measurements scattered throughout a rapidly growing body of research findings. Their goal is to create a global, connected knowledge graph that can be used as a tool for scientists to guide new discoveries and verify experimental results. In the PeriodO context, however, we are not concerned with making an exhaustive taxonomy of ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù periods or facilitating the ‚Äúdiscovery‚Äù of new periods (a non sequitur‚Äîthere are no periods that exist in the world that are awaiting discovery by some inquiring historian or archaeologist). Instead we are interested in enabling the study and citation of how and by whom time has been segmented into different periods. It is not necessary that these segmentations be falsifiable to achieve this goal; they only need to be comparable.

            - #[[@kuhnBroadeningScopeNanopublications2013]] expressed concern that requiring formal representation for all scientific data published as nanopublications ‚Äúseems to be unrealistic in many cases and might restrict the range of practical application considerably.‚Äù Similarly, requiring assertions to be unambiguous and falsifiable would unnecessarily restrict the practical application of nanopublication. The nature of nanopublication assertions should ultimately be determined by the practical needs of the researchers who use them. What is important about nanopublications is not the nature of the assertions, but the expression of [[provenance]]. Provenance is particularly important for non-scientific datasets, since the assertions made are so dependent on their wider discursive context. When assertions cannot be tested experimentally, understanding context is critical for judging quality, trustworthiness, and usefulness.

        - [[provenance]] is especially critical for interpreting more "discursive" claims

            - this is an #example-of [[context]] #[[[[CLM]] - Contextualizability is necessary for synthesis]]

            - related: this might be related to how fields vary by how relevance is defined, and some are more about [[paradigmatic relevance]]
