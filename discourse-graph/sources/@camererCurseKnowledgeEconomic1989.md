    - Student estimating company earnings

    - Student were not able to ignore their current knowledge when making the estimates.

    - The knowledge of the company biases these student to their own knowledge hence having a harder time trying to guess prediction of uninformed subjects.

    - The curse of knowledge make it difficult for expertise to bridge with novice because "they have difÔ¨Åculty imagining ever having been so ill-informed on the topic and accurately imagining the information that novices might not know."

    - Feedback does not change the expert (student with knowledge about the company) estimate of company earnings and they were anchor to their original knowledge.
