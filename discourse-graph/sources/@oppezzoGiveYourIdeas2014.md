- Title:: Give your ideas some legs: The positive effect of walking on creative thinking
- Author(s):: [[Marily Oppezzo]], [[Daniel L. Schwartz]]
- Abstract:: Four experiments demonstrate that walking boosts creative ideation in real time and shortly after. In Experiment 1, while seated and then when walking on a treadmill, adults completed Guilford’s alternate uses (GAU) test of creative divergent thinking and the compound remote associates (CRA) test of convergent thinking. Walking increased 81% of participants’ creativity on the GAU, but only increased 23% of participants’ scores for the CRA. In Experiment 2, participants completed the GAU when seated and then walking, when walking and then seated, or when seated twice. Again, walking led to higher GAU scores. Moreover, when seated after walking, participants exhibited a residual creative boost. Experiment 3 generalized the prior effects to outdoor walking. Experiment 4 tested the effect of walking on creative analogy generation. Participants sat inside, walked on a treadmill inside, walked outside, or were rolled outside in a wheelchair. Walking outside produced the most novel and highest quality analogies. The effects of outdoor stimulation and walking were separable. Walking opens up the free flow of ideas, and it is a simple and robust solution to the goals of increasing creativity and increasing physical activity.

“…The neurobiological and psychological mechanism by which walking enhances novelty of divergent thinking is unclear and remains to be investigated. Nevertheless, this finding is consistent with a recent report that a brief walk on a treadmill or outdoors can boost divergent thinking in terms of novelty on the AUT [16]. In this study, subjects generated more novel responses on a 4-min AUT while walking on a treadmill compared to while staying seated.…”

“…In accordance with the total creative performance score, originality and fluency were positively associated with bodily movement, however, only fluency was associated with PAA. This is in line with many laboratory studies investigating the association with physical activity by means of creativity measures combining fluency and originality of ideas 19  ,  28  ,  30  . Finally, the sample size of the present study might be too small to detect a small effect of PAA on the association between creativity and physical activity by means of a frequentist approach.…”

“…Walking and thinking creates a unique context for such interaction with faculty and peers as well as for their feedback. As scholars have previously found (Kahneman, 2011; Keinänen, 2016; O’Mara 2019; Oppezzo & Schwartz, 2014), this study supports the power of walking and thinking to make an impact.…”

“…Whereas cycling with maximal effort impaired flexibility of divergent thinking in Colzato et al [ 21  ], here our exercise intervention improved flexibility. This may partially support the hypothesis we speculated in the Introduction that exercises at low-to-moderate intensity might be better able to enhance divergent thinking than exercise at too low or too high an intensity ([  21  ,  22  ,  23  ]). The hypothesis, however, still requires further confirmation by future studies with more homogenous and accurately prescribed intensities.…”

“…Experiments confirm recent suggestions ( Keinänen, 2016  ; O’Mara, 2019 ) that walking may drive creative idea production and facilitate imaginative thinking (  Oppezzo and Schwartz, 2014  ;  Keinänen, 2016  ;  Kuo and Yeh, 2016  ).  Oppezzo and Schwartz (2014)  show short periods of corridor or treadmill walking approximately doubles creative idea production in a divergent thinking task, compared with a similar seated period;  Kuo and Yeh (2016)  find a similar effect in aging adults, where a short period of walking approximately doubles their creative idea production, compared to young seated controls. The underlying neurocognitive mechanisms have not been fully delineated, but whole-body (locomotor) movement drives hippocampal formation activity to a remarkable degree (e.g.…”

“…There does seem to be a small but compelling body of research suggesting the role of the body in enacting metaphors for creative thinking, however more research is needed that replicate results. Nonetheless, these findings align with “traditional” psychology studies demonstrating, for example, benefits of physical activity, including walking (Colzato et al, 2013; Oppezzo and Schwartz, 2014), how movements can activate the right hemisphere to enhance divergent thinking (Goldstein et al, 2010; Mihov et al, 2010), and how the ambient conditions in a setting can benefit creativity through processing disfluency (low level distraction) (Mehta et al, 2012). The embodied metaphor stream underscores how the body constrains cognition, however this is not necessarily incompatible with representational models of cognition.…”

“…Our findings add to the growing literature that demonstrates a positive effect of physical movement on performance on creative tasks (Oppezzo & Schwartz, 2014;Slepian & Ambady, 2012). While previous studies have manipulated the movement of participants and tested the effect on performance, we have shown that spontaneous movement is positively related to creative performance.…”

“…For example, Goel, Eimontaite, Goel, and Schindler (2015) recently argued that insight problems (such as the RAT) are a subset of well-structured problems, while divergent problem solving tasks (such as the alternative uses and invention tasks) are a subset of ill-structured problems. Our results also echo a number of recent studies that have demonstrated the psychological separability of divergent and convergent problem solving processes (Chermahini & Hommel, 2010;Colzato et al, 2012;Hommel, Colzato, Fischer, & Christoffels, 2011;Oppezzo & Schwartz, 2014;Radel et al, 2015). We join these more nuanced arguments to call for more careful analyses of the components of creative performance (e.g., separating divergent vs. convergent processes) in future research on creativity.…”

“…Unlike previous work [10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23], we did not observe any beneficial effect of acute walking exercise on creativity task performance. This is an important observation as it brings light to the possibility that acute exercise may not robustly enhance cognitive creativity performance.…”

“…4 Differences between the five groups (cognitive-high demand; cognitive-low demand; motor-high demand; motor-low demand; no-inductioncontrol) on the three creative performance indices across the series of five trials (error bars represent the 95% confidence intervals of the mean) more sustained in the case of ideational fluency in creativity, as it was associated with greater levels of fluency in creative performance across all trials. This would fit with evidence that showcases the positive influence of undemanding motor activities, such as walking, on creativity (Oppezzo and Schwartz 2014). The current findings then do not align seamlessly with the opposite line of evidence (Radel et al 2015) namely that depleting information-processing resources leads to an improvement in creative performance, which would be expected given the hypothesis of the positive impact of mild disinhibition on creativity (Abraham 2014;Carson et al 2003).…”
