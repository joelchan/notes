        - talks about the idea of "[[Klondike spaces]]" to frame why creative problems are hard: there is no direct connection to diversity here, but I think we can test these. the four properties of klondike spaces are:

            1. the **wilderness** problem - "suitable solutions occur ^^sparsely scattered^^ in a large space of inadequate solutions"

                1. ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FqQwE1cIgYW.png?alt=media&token=178b101a-b457-49bf-8ded-0f678431bc1e) (p. 526)

            1. the **plateau** problem - "in large regions, there is ^^no clear gradient^^ of promise...the possibility space is full of flat, directionless plateaus"

                1. ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FLD18mPll36.png?alt=media&token=d6bfb8de-2c3f-47cc-88d3-9698a360da3d) (p. 527)

            1. the **canyon** problem - "search proceeds within limiting and often unrecognized boundaries, with suitable resolutions in another part of the possibility space altogether"

                1. ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F4iwB8SAQ2t.png?alt=media&token=99bd3515-b375-414f-8c8a-6a2ce61d2dc5) (p. 527)

            1. the **oasis** problem - "it is hard to abandon the neighborhood of a promising partial solution even when the partial solution resists refinement...in artificial intelligence terms, this is the problem of local maxima"

                1. ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FHkjY8kjiuS.png?alt=media&token=4245861d-0cbf-40e8-a112-625d05f0d009) (p. 527)

                1. sounds like [[üß± fixation]] to me, or [[local minima]]

        - notes from zotero

            - (525) this reminds me of steven johnson's thoughts on the importance of exaptations in biological evolution

            - (529) this is a very relevant issue when considering the potential role of distant sources of inspiration - maybe the statistics really area against succeeding when drawing from very distant sources

            - (532) here's another piece of evidence that far analogies are construed as holding the most potential for being transformative

            - (534) the canyon problem again points to the possibility of far analogies leading to leaps in absolute space; however, the oasis problem does point to the potential benefits of analogy "nudging" ideation along in slightly different, but not too far, directions, keeping the chains moving and the ideas flowing and buzzing

            - (536) cf the notion of exaptations

            - (530) the researchers seemed to be attuned to the statistics of benefiting from distant sources, and stuck to relatively close analogies for generative purposes(0)

            - (527) canyon problem calls for representation change? reframing the problem?
