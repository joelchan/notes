        - Abstract

            - We employ two study designs for a more detailed examination of creativity in the opportunity identification process. We employ a correlational field study to test the hypothesis that diver- gent thinking affects venture growth through business idea generation. We use an experimen- tal design to test the hypothesis that diversity of information moderates the effect of divergent thinking on business idea generation. Analyses based on 98 business owners across both study designs supported our hypotheses. Combining the findings fromboth designs points to boundary conditions of theories suggesting constraining information; thismayweaken the indirect effect of divergent thinking on venture growth.

    - # Background notes

        - Generally interested in model of relationship between "creativity" and new business ventures (this is why it's cited). But it does include a manipulation of diversity of stimuli (ideas given as inspiration).

    - # Methods notes

        - Manipulation: diversity of information = four ideas from constrained (from same goal) vs. diverse (from N different goals) sets of four ideas, drawn from a previous pilot study

        - Procedure: generate business ideas in a face-to-face interview related to lifelong learning; receive stimuli after they stop generating ideas initially, then asked to generate more ideas. total time ~109 mins

    - # Results of interest

        - main result of interest is an interesting interaction between prior divergent thinking ability and the effects of diverse vs. constraining stimuli for a business ideation task, in terms of both quantity and originality of ideas

                - Caution: the analysis of simple slopes was technically for the opposite direction (how diversity moderates effect of "divergent thinking" ability)

    - # Discussion/implications

        - Really wonder if this replicates!!! #[[âž° breadcrumbs]]

        - Also super interesting because this runs counter to [some intuitions](so [[Mark Fuge]]'s intuition is that on the global/exploration end, diversity of initial samples should have limited marginal gain over existing propensity to explore) about whether/how diverse examples woudl benefit different optimizers
