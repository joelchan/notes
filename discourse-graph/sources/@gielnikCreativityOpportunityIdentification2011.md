        - Abstract

            - We employ two study designs for a more detailed examination of creativity in the opportunity identification process. We employ a correlational field study to test the hypothesis that diver- gent thinking affects venture growth through business idea generation. We use an experimen- tal design to test the hypothesis that diversity of information moderates the effect of divergent thinking on business idea generation. Analyses based on 98 business owners across both study designs supported our hypotheses. Combining the findings fromboth designs points to boundary conditions of theories suggesting constraining information; thismayweaken the indirect effect of divergent thinking on venture growth.
