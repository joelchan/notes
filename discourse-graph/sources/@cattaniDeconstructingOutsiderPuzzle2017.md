        - Abstract

            - The proposition that outsiders often are crucial carriers of novelty into an established institutional field has received wide empirical support. But an equally compelling proposition points to the following puzzle: the very same conditions that enhance outsiders? ability to make novel contributions also hinder their ability to carry them out. We seek to address this puzzle by examining the contextual circumstances that affect the legitimation of novelty originating from a noncertified outsider that challenged the status quo in an established institutional field. Our research case material is John Harrison?s introduction of a new mechanical method for measuring longitude at sea?the marine chronometer?which challenged the dominant astronomical approach. We find that whether an outsider?s new offer gains or is denied legitimacy is influenced by (1) the outsider?s agency to further a new offer, (2) the existence of multiple audiences with different dispositions toward this offer, and (3) the occurrence of an exogenous jolt that helps create a more receptive social space. We organize these insights into a multilevel conceptual framework that builds on previous work but attributes a more decisive role to the interplay between endogenous and exogenous variables in shaping a field?s shifting receptiveness to novelty. The framework exposes the interdependencies between the micro-, meso-, and macro-level processes that jointly affect an outsider?s efforts to introduce novelty into an existing field.

        - sources for the historical case study were longitude histories as well as archival documents, such as the minutes of the Board of Longitude, excerpts from the Journal of the House of Commons, [[John Harrison]]'s pamphlet on the longitude controversy, and documents and a pamphlet written by the treasurer of the British Navy during the period of the controversy

                - John Harrison (an outsider to the field of astronomy) invented a new mechanical method to measuring longitude at sea in 1710. This method was different from the dominant astronomical approach. It took ~60 years for this innovation to be accepted by the board of longitude in 1770 (the core of the field), because he had to pass through barriers of legitimacy, including initial resistance from the astronomers and politicians (despite initial positive reception from the navy). This internal resistance was eventually overcome by external actors intervening, such as the royal society (which influenced the astronomers), and the monarchy (which influenced the politicians).

                    - Close to the resistance of analogical inspiration

                    - What do external actors do? Royalty, power play. Explain the significance better

                - Isaac Newton had expressed high skepticism that solutions for the longitude problem could come from outside of astronomic science, in response to multiple failures of proposals from outside astronomy

- As I'm processing micropubs for [[@cattaniDeconstructingOutsiderPuzzle2017]], I'm noticing an [[ethnographic sneeze]] re: the distinction between micropubs and synthesis notes in [[[[PTN]] - discourse graph]]

    - For historical case studies, and claims of a historical nature, the synthesis notes are often already in the past tense, and do not necessarily need to be generalized. But yet I think they are still synthesis notes... is it the causal nature of those claims?

    - Here's the example:

        - Synthesis-like (though in past tense): George Graham and the Royal Society played an important role in legitimizing the outsider innovation of John Harrison.

        - Probably a better micropub (or component micropubs) that are less causal/inferential and more observational:

            - John Harrison progressed towards legitimacy more quickly after encountering George Graham and the Royal Society

            - The Royal Society wrote a

            - The Royal Society provided resources to [[John Harrison]] to start working on his initial prototype

            - The Royal Society supported [[John Harrison]]'s proposal to do a field trial of his initial prototype (H1) on the HMS __Centurion__

        - And other related micropubs:

            - Approximately 1/3 of Royal Society fellows in its early days were scientists, with the rest made up various "curious minds"

            - Thomas Hobbes ridiculed the experimentalists in the Royal Society by comparing them to "quacks", "mechanics", and "workmen"

    - This cannot be a hard distinction, however, since [[Z: Observation is theory-laden]].

        - It might seem obvious if we directly observed him inventing it: but what about counterclaims from others who had similar ideas at the same time? Invention is too complex a process to observe directly, and it also inherently a socially constructed judgment.

            - This is true to a certain extent even of seemingly "obvious" things like instrument readings. But arguably to a lesser extent.

            - More synthesis-note-like

                - Thomas Edison is the inventor of the lightbulb

                    - "inventor of" is a more fraught, socially constructed judgment that requires lots of backing statements (observation notes)

            - More observation-note-like:

                - Thomas Edison made a lightbulb

                - Society X formally credited Thomas Edison with the invention of the lightbulb

        - So the distinction here should be primarily **pragmatic**, not ontological.

            - When to distinguish synthesis notes and observation notes is guided pragmatically, by the extent to which distinctions help push you towards a richer and more effective [[synthesis]].

            - This means that one person's synthesis note might be another's observation note.

            - Or an observation note might be questioned as the field progresses and then "unpacked" (e.g. by being problematized) into a synthesis note

                - What to do then with the observation notes, and the web of connections it is a part of?

                    - Suspect we don't want to be too rigid about this.

        - Even something that seems "factual" like "Thomas Edison invented the lightbulb" can be contentious!

    - What to do with this then?

        - If your [[synthesis]] depends critically on particular ideas (they are core to your argument or model), then you want to tend towards preserving as much [[context]] as possible, which means not "hiding" potentially contentious ideas or claims as observation notes

        - For other ideas that may be less core, you can probably afford to make less fine distinctions.

            - Hopefully this is ok because of these fallbacks:

                - But also: hopefully what you gloss over, others might need to make fine distinctions because it is central to their argument or synthesis, and you can retrieve them from the P2P commons

                - Your observation notes are also never lossily compressed, because they are at least minimally tied to a context snippet, that allows you to start [[recontextualization]] if you need to make finer distinctions later
