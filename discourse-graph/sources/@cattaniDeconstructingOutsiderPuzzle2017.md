        - Abstract

            - The proposition that outsiders often are crucial carriers of novelty into an established institutional field has received wide empirical support. But an equally compelling proposition points to the following puzzle: the very same conditions that enhance outsiders? ability to make novel contributions also hinder their ability to carry them out. We seek to address this puzzle by examining the contextual circumstances that affect the legitimation of novelty originating from a noncertified outsider that challenged the status quo in an established institutional field. Our research case material is John Harrison?s introduction of a new mechanical method for measuring longitude at sea?the marine chronometer?which challenged the dominant astronomical approach. We find that whether an outsider?s new offer gains or is denied legitimacy is influenced by (1) the outsider?s agency to further a new offer, (2) the existence of multiple audiences with different dispositions toward this offer, and (3) the occurrence of an exogenous jolt that helps create a more receptive social space. We organize these insights into a multilevel conceptual framework that builds on previous work but attributes a more decisive role to the interplay between endogenous and exogenous variables in shaping a field?s shifting receptiveness to novelty. The framework exposes the interdependencies between the micro-, meso-, and macro-level processes that jointly affect an outsider?s efforts to introduce novelty into an existing field.

            - The paper argued that outsiders may not legitimize their innovation into an existing field. This is a puzzle that the very same condition that enables innovation may also hinder their ability to carry them out.

                - John Harrison (an outsider to the field of astronomy) invented a new mechanical method to measuring longitude at sea in 1710. This method was different from the dominant astronomical approach. It took ~60 years for this innovation to be accepted by the board of longitude in 1770 (the core of the field), because he had to pass through barriers of legitimacy, including initial resistance from the astronomers and politicians (despite initial positive reception from the navy). This internal resistance was eventually overcome by external actors intervening, such as the royal society (which influenced the astronomers), and the monarchy (which influenced the politicians).

                    - Close to the resistance of analogical inspiration

                    - What do external actors do? Royalty, power play. Explain the significance better

                - Isaac Newton had expressed high skepticism that solutions for the longitude problem could come from outside of astronomic science, in response to multiple failures of proposals from outside astronomy
