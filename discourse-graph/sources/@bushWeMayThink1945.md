- Roam is all in on [[associative trails]] (cc [[@bushWeMayThink1945]]) as the primary way to navigate, and begrudgingly supports structured directed search (querying). Trying to hack metadata and blocks to support precise querying might actually be an anti-pattern in Roam, fighting against its strengths

    - This is why I think there is something very special about the UX insights in [[Beau Haan]]'s [[sys/lebeauzettel]] - [[Rob Haisfield]] had the right insight that is much more about manual exploratory navigation and browsing than querying. And this is good for more unstructured, [incrementally formalized]([[[[PTN]] - incremental formalization]]), evolving "chaos" of creative thought. In [[Ted Nelson]]'s terms, [[@nelsonComplexInformationProcessing1965]], it excels for supporting complex information processing for "the complex, the changing and the indeterminate".

    - That said, I do think that integrating this with more (lightly) structured querying is powerful and necessary for going further up the rigor ladder of synthesis
