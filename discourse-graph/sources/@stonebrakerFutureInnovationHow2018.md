        - Abstract

            - This paper highlights the ways that three different libraries are working to support entrepreneurs in their community: a public librarian connected with city government to support a small business development center; a librarian from a private university worked with social entrepreneurs that want to transform the world with business; a librarian from a large public land-grant works with entrepreneurs across the campus including business incubators and business competitions. The work these librarians do highlights the many ways libraries support entrepreneurs through collaboration, vision, and partnership.

        - Case studies from 3 different librarians from three different institutions (3 case studies)

            - 1. Librarian from public library in Illinois: describes a successful partnership with local government to create an entrepreneurship initiative

            - 2. Librarian from a large private liberal arts university describes the work the library did with a social entrepreneurship initiative

            - 3. A librarian from a large public library describes the many entrepreneurship efforts on the campus and how they work with them.

        - Case studies are described by library representatives (the authors) who presumably were directly involved in those initiatives

        - Public libraries surveyed by UMD DIS: how many, where?

    - #[[üìù lit-notes]]

                    - MPEI as a one stop shop that have resources from all three institutions: the chamber, the library, and the village.

                    - All three institutions (Chamber, Library, Village) pooled the following resources: financial and network-related, avoidance of program topic duplication, and increased awareness and perceived validity for library business programs.

                    - Entrepreneurs tends to approach organization that they are most familiar with. (Claim without any citation but probably a valid assumption made from the interview)
