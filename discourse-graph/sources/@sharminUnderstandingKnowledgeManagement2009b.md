- Title:: Understanding knowledge management practices for early design activity and its implications for reuse
- Author(s):: [[Moushumi Sharmin]], [[Brian P. Bailey]], [[Cole Coats]], [[Kevin Hamilton]]
- Abstract:: Prior knowledge is a critical resource for design, especially when designers are striving to generate new ideas for complex problems. Systems that improve access to relevant prior knowledge and promote reuse can improve design efficiency and outcomes. Unfortunately, such systems have not been widely adopted indicating that user needs in this area have not been adequately understood. In this paper, we report the results of a contextual inquiry into the practices of and attitudes toward knowledge management and reuse during early design. The study consisted of interviews and surveys with professional designers in the creative domains. A novel aspect of our work is the focus on early design, which differs from but complements prior worksâ€™ focus on knowledge reuse during later design and implementation phases. Our study yielded new findings and implications that, if applied, will help bring the benefits of knowledge management systems and reuse into early design activity.

    - this is a really cool paper, worth a much closer read

            - i really really wonder what the findings would be if the study were repeated today! my guess is not that much has changed... [[@herringGettingInspiredUnderstanding2009]] was also around the same time, and has similar results around the lack of organization as a problem

        - there's also something here for [[[[QUE]] - What are the most efficient routes to useful cross-boundary knowledge?]], where people use examples as a first proxy to figure out who to talk to
