        - Abstract

            - Prototypes ground group communication and facilitate decision making. However, overly investing in a single design idea can lead to fixation and impede the collaborative process. Does sharing multiple designs improve collaboration? In a study, participants created advertisements individually and then met with a partner. In the Share Multiple condition, participants designed and shared three ads. In the Share Best condition, participants designed three ads and selected one to share. In the Share One condition, participants designed and shared one ad. Sharing multiple designs improved outcome, exploration, sharing, and group rapport. These participants integrated more of their partner's ideas into their own subsequent designs, explored a more divergent set of ideas, and provided more productive critiques of their partner's designs. Furthermore, their ads were rated more highly and garnered a higher click-through rate when hosted online.

    - Goal: invesitgate whether sharing multiple designs improve collaboration

    - Conditions:

        - __Share One __condition: participants designed and shared one ad.

        - __Share Best __condition: participants designed three ads and selected one to share.

        - __Share Multiple __condition: participants designed and shared three ads.

    - Result 1: __Sharing multiple__ led to higher quality designs

    - Result 2: __Sharing multiple__ led to more individual exploration

    - Result 3: Group rapport rose for partners who shared multiple
