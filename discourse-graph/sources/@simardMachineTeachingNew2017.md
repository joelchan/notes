        - Abstract

            - The current processes for building machine learning systems require practitioners with deep knowledge of machine learning. This signiﬁcantly limits the number of machine learning systems that can be created and has led to a mismatch between the demand for machine learning systems and the ability for organizations to build them. We believe that in order to meet this growing demand for machine learning systems we must signiﬁcantly increase the number of individuals that can teach machines. We postulate that we can achieve this goal by making the process of teaching machines easy, fast and above all, universally accessible.

    - Enable people with no expertise in the model itself to still create/shape an ML model

    - This area of research is relevant because it includes some probing of how ordinary people perceive the [[material properties]] of ML models, seen in how they choose examples to give to the model

    - IN other words, this might give us a sense of where you *start* (the gap between an expert's material knowledge, and a novice's)

    - In the limit also, this line of research assumes that you do *NOT* need [[material knowledge]] of ML, only your domain, if the system works well enough (h/t [[Wei-Wei Chi]])
