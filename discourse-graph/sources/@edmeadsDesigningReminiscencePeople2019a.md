        - Abstract

            - We investigate how technology can be used to support people with dementia to engage in Reminiscence Therapy. We used a participatory design approach carried out over three stages: scope, design and evaluation, involving five participants with dementia. We also engaged professionals and caregivers through a survey. We provide initial recommendations for engaging participants with dementia on how they wish to reminisce and what technology may support this.
