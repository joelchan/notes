        - Abstract

            - An analysis of the process of analogical thinking predicts that [analogies]([[analogy]]) will be noticed on the basis of semantic retrieval cues and that the induction of a general schema from concrete analogs will facilitate analogical transfer. These predictions were tested in experiments in which subjects first read one or more stories illus- trating problems and their solutions and then attempted to solve a disparate but analogous transfer problem. The studies in Part I attempted to foster the abstrac- tion of a problem schema from a single story analog by means of summarization instructions, a verbal statement of the underlying principle, or a diagrammatic representation of it. None of these devices achieved a notable degree of sucess. In contrast, the experiments in Part II demonstrated that if two prior analogs were given, subjects often derived a problem schema as an incidental product of de- scribing the similarities of the analogs. The quality of the induced schema was highly predictive of subsequent transfer performance. Furthermore, the verbal statements and diagrams that had failed to facilitate transfer from one analog proved highly beneficial when paired with two. The function of examples in learning was discussed in light of the present study.

    - everything is terrible with only one analog without a hint: [summarization](No advantage of summary over recall.), [statement of principle](((jPHrhJ99T))), and [diagram of principle](((Q9SmOi4Nv))), all fail to move the needle up from the base rate of ~30% without hint.

    - with [two analogs and no hint](slight advantage of similar analog pairs compared to one analog; biggest advantage for dissimilar analog pairs, although still quite a bit lower than ceiling (~50% before hint)), the base rate goes up to ~50% (for dissimilar analog pairs), though still lower than with hint

        - [statements of the principle](statement of principle helps) and [diagrams of the principle](((JRBCiy3Fh))) each have additive positive effects, further bumping up performance to about 60%

    - note: #[[‚û∞ breadcrumbs]] - these are barebones observation notes, not yet quite polished to stand on their own with context from the experimental materials

    - these findings add to [[@gickAnalogicalProblemSolving1980]]'s core claim that [[[[CLM]] - People are more likely to benefit from analogies if they encounter/process them with an active goal or license to use them for inspiration]]
[[March 9th, 2021]]

- Additional replications in first set of experiments in [[@gickSchemaInductionAnalogical1983]], which is basically about trying to up the success rate from the "no hint" condition

    - Tried: principle, diagram, summary; best is dissimilar analogs (similar to [[@yuDistributedAnalogicalIdea2014]]) - again, here it's **interaction** between more than one analog/source

        - but also the base rate overall is still lower than the hint conditions
[[November 5th, 2021]]

- However, either effective problem formulation or generating analogies for a problem is hard for human ([[@gentnerAnalogicalRemindingGood1985]], [[@gentnerRolesSimilarityTransfer1993]], [[@gickSchemaInductionAnalogical1983]], [[@holyoakMentalLeapsAnalogy1996]], [[@halfordHowManyVariablesHumans2005]][[@hopeAcceleratingInnovationAnalogy2017]])

    - Whether to mention: especially for design novices?

    - [[[[CLM]] - Analogical retrieval in humans is dominated by surface similarity]]
[[March 16th, 2021]]

- Quick thoughts while reading [[@gickSchemaInductionAnalogical1983]]

    - The typical situation for analogical problem solving is that a seeker has a problem that is less-well-understood, and draws on some other analog to try to understand/solve it better. This implies that the other analog must be.... understandable!

        - It is important to distinguish cases where the cross-domain analog is within the knowledge bounds of the seeker

        - Is it a fool's errand to try to expose people to cross-boundary knowledge that is new to them?

            - Probably yes, in isolation? Or at least, they won't really be able to *do* anything useful with it, and may even be led astray??
[[July 1st, 2021]]

- the way the devices were described makes me wonder how they compare to encountering these devices in the wild, vs. "curated" to facilitate noticing of the analogical mapping, like in [[@gickSchemaInductionAnalogical1983]] and [[@reedRoleAnalogyTransfer1974]]

    - cf.
