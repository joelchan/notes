        - #> "As Deacon (2000)
notes, problematization cannot be reduced to a
mechanical or even strictly analytical procedure, since it always involves some kind of creative act. “It is a creation in the sense that, given
a certain situation, one cannot infer that precisely this kind of problematization will follow”
(2000: 135). " (p. 256)

        - #> "Generating research questions through problematizion, in the sense of identifying and challenging the assumptions underlying existing
theories, therefore appears to be a central ingredient in the development of more interesting
and influential theories within management
studies. " (P.247)
