        - Abstract

            - Scope: The purpose of this study was to explore the use and effectiveness of current awareness (CA) methods, especially SDI, among chemists at Canadian universities. Method: We used a questionnaire which was mailed to a sample of 170 (response rate 80%). The variables studied include perceived scatter of information, use of various CA methods, time spent on CA, perceived success in CA, and CA efficiency = success/time spent. The results of this explanatory study are tentative. Major results: Keeping up-to-date is more difficult in specialties with high scatter of information (hypothesis 5). SDI seems to be the only method capable of counteracting scatter (hypotheses 5‚Äì7). In contrast, if scatter is low, SDI use decreases CA efficiency (hypothesis 6a); scanning journals, the most prevalent CA method, seems to be sufficient for low-scatter specialties. High scatter does not lead to increased SDI use, in some cases due to perceived difficulty of profile construction (hypothesis 3a). Conclusions: SDI services should concentrate efforts on serving scientists in specialties with high scatter of information by developing systems that are capable of searching across conventional disciplines and specialties, by providing assistance in profile development, and by conducting a marketing campaign directed toward these scientists.
