        - Abstract

            - Scope: The purpose of this study was to explore the use and effectiveness of current awareness (CA) methods, especially SDI, among chemists at Canadian universities. Method: We used a questionnaire which was mailed to a sample of 170 (response rate 80%). The variables studied include perceived scatter of information, use of various CA methods, time spent on CA, perceived success in CA, and CA efficiency = success/time spent. The results of this explanatory study are tentative. Major results: Keeping up-to-date is more difficult in specialties with high scatter of information (hypothesis 5). SDI seems to be the only method capable of counteracting scatter (hypotheses 5–7). In contrast, if scatter is low, SDI use decreases CA efficiency (hypothesis 6a); scanning journals, the most prevalent CA method, seems to be sufficient for low-scatter specialties. High scatter does not lead to increased SDI use, in some cases due to perceived difficulty of profile construction (hypothesis 3a). Conclusions: SDI services should concentrate efforts on serving scientists in specialties with high scatter of information by developing systems that are capable of searching across conventional disciplines and specialties, by providing assistance in profile development, and by conducting a marketing campaign directed toward these scientists.

- Intriguing: there is an idea of [[SDI]] (Selective Dissemination of Information) as a way to deal with [[Scatter]], documented in part in [[@packerImportanceSDICurrent1979]]

    - As described in [[@bates1996learning]], [[SDI]] is basically librarian-powered recommendation systems for scholars :) Really curious to see how these stack up against a rec sys.

- [[@packerImportanceSDICurrent1979]] explores the efficacy of [[SDI]] as a function of [[Scatter]], and reports that [[SDI]] [use](((dvVQF3fsu))) was associated with a significant *reduction* in efficiency of keeping up to date with the literature for [scholars](((5IIOQ5CZq))) in [self-reported](((Iv7Euw1wK))) low-[[Scatter]] fields; in contrast, SDI use was **not** associated with efficiency for high-scatter scholars (although there was a numeric trend in a positive direction)

    - These findings are relevant for understanding [[[[QUE]] - What are the most efficient routes to useful cross-boundary knowledge?]], in the sense that efficiency is extremely important, because the costs are so high for navigating and assessing information across boundaries (which tend to be high [[Scatter]])

        - [[@packerImportanceSDICurrent1979]] in particular is instructive as a cautionary tale that a decontextualized recommender service can really help in boundary-crossing / [navigating]([[[[CLM]] - Interdisciplinary synthesis is hard because of scatter in the literature]]) high-[[Scatter]] / [[interdisciplinarity]]

            - seems like a supporting observation for [[[[QUE]] - What are the most efficient routes to useful cross-boundary knowledge?]]

            - this is really making me wonder about what we have discovered since [[SDI]]s

                - I'm worried that most [[recommender system]]s work seems to be evaluated with offline evaluations. I recall that the [[sys/DocEar]] team has done some excellent work on evaluations

                    - Found this good paper comparing offline, online, and user study data

                        - Really low absolute performance (in the single digits at best)

                        - Thoughtful criticisms of offline datasets in light of [[[[CLM]] - Citation practices in science are far from optimal]] and other criticisms

                    - This paper quantifies the balance of eval methods: ~70% of approaches as of [[2013]] were with offline eval, 34% had a user study (only 10% in a detailed usage setting) - should prioritize looking up those papers to triangulate against [[@packerImportanceSDICurrent1979]]

    - They also replicate the results of [[@moteReasonsVariationInformation1962]] in terms of time spent vs. [[Scatter]]
