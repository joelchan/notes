                - __What questions are the authors tackling and how do they intersect with what we care about? What key concepts or ideas or people do you notice that might be useful for us? What are some of the possible major contributions/results we will care about from this source?__

                - __One block for each result of interest. we'll refactor this together into EVD notes__

                        - __nest details and screenshots (e.g., key figures, quotes) under here__

                        - __block ref in major methods details from the source methods / context block we might need later to make sense of this result, particularly as they might conflict with others. __

                    - __also discuss possible critiques/claims. create source CLM notes for author conclusions (if you like), or reference other CLMs that we have that engage with this__

                - __Also can discuss meta-results (combinations of results) in a similar template.____

- I think [[@ribaupierreExtractingDiscourseElements2017]] has some other examples as well

    - Scientists were rarely (on average, about 1/3 of the time at most) interested in reading the whole paper; instead they are interested in specific elements, such as a finding, a method, a hypothesis, or a definition (p.5) #Atomicity

    - Results

        - [[[[EVD]] - Scientists more often nonlinearly read subsections of papers for findings, hypotheses or other information, rather than linearly reading whole documents - [[@ribaupierreExtractingDiscourseElements2017]]]]

        - [scientists](setting: 1410 documents in gender studies; 8 scientists (4 gender studies, 4 other fields)) who [compared](((I_uXzCuyy))) an [enhanced faceted search engine](((5OAeQgh2B))) (with ability to search a large corpus of articles by discourse elements) to a regular keyword search system in terms of efficacy for various [targeted search tasks](((6HYDEe9e3))), [self-reported](((pDK5Rlynx))) a significantly higher signal-to-noise ratio in results with the faceted search system compared to the keyword search system

            - Very similar to [[@harsDesigningScientificKnowledge2001]]'s synthesis, although they don't cite him

        - Powerful #example-of a complex query that can't be answered in existing document-centric infrastructure: "Find all the findings that analyse why the number of women in academia falls more sharply than the number of men after their first child, using qualitative and quantitative methodologies"

        - Found this super good cited paper from [[CSCW]] [[@paepckeInformationNeedsTechnical1996]] that has this fun idea of [[information compound]]s!

            - it's also super relevant to [[[[CLM]] - Specifying context for future reuse requires predicting trajectories of future reuse]]
