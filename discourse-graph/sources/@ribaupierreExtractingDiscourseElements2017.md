                - __What questions are the authors tackling and how do they intersect with what we care about? What key concepts or ideas or people do you notice that might be useful for us? What are some of the possible major contributions/results we will care about from this source?__

                - __One block for each result of interest. we'll refactor this together into EVD notes__

                        - __block ref in major methods details from the source methods / context block we might need later to make sense of this result, particularly as they might conflict with others. __

                    - __also discuss possible critiques/claims. create source CLM notes for author conclusions (if you like), or reference other CLMs that we have that engage with this__

                - __Also can discuss meta-results (combinations of results) in a similar template.____
