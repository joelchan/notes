        - #Claim Somewhat-far analogies strike the best balance between novelty and quality

        - two key results:

            - [[[[EVD]] - participants who received computationally selected far analogical stimuli had a lower ceiling on novelty and quality of ideas compared to participants who received near or no analogical stimuli - [[@fuMeaningFarImpact2013]]]]

            - [[[[EVD]] - when placed in the same semantic space, computationally selected near and far analogical stimuli were farther away from human-selected near and far analogical stimuli for the same problem - [[@fuMeaningFarImpact2013]]]]
