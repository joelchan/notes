        - #Claim Somewhat-far analogies strike the best balance between novelty and quality

        - two key results:

            - [[[[EVD]] - participants who received computationally selected far analogical stimuli had a lower ceiling on novelty and quality of ideas compared to participants who received near or no analogical stimuli - [[@fuMeaningFarImpact2013]]]]

            - [[[[EVD]] - when placed in the same semantic space, computationally selected near and far analogical stimuli were farther away from human-selected near and far analogical stimuli for the same problem - [[@fuMeaningFarImpact2013]]]]

‚Äú‚Ä¶This potential boost from working on the intervening task for creativity on the main task may be present only when individuals work on tasks within the same general domain and not when they engage in tasks that are in a different knowledge domain. Similar to previous studies on ‚Äúnear‚Äù and ‚Äúfar‚Äù analogies in design (Fu et al., [ref]), our results demonstrate that switching to an intervening task may be more beneficial to creativity when this task is at least in the same knowledge domain or not ‚Äútoo far‚Äù away from the main task.‚Ä¶‚Äù

----------------------------------------------------------------
‚Äú‚Ä¶These findings from our case study resonate with the prior studies on design stimulation that have suggested near-field stimuli are more effective to inspire designers and produce more feasible ideas (Fu et al, 2013b;Srinivasan et al, 2018;Goucher-Lambert and Cagan, 2019), whereas far-field stimuli are less effective but may contribute to novelty of the ideas once they are generated (Gentner and Markman, 1997;Ward, 1998;Luo et al, 2018;Srinivasan et al, 2018). Observing such tradeoffs, Fu et al (2013aFu et al ( , 2013b hypothesized that the stimuli from the "middle ground" may be desirable. He and Luo (2017) suggested that the most valuable inventions are based on mainly conventional combinations of prior work and a minor insertion of highly novel combinations.‚Ä¶‚Äù

----------------------------------------------------------------
‚Äú‚Ä¶In brief, we have identified a clear 'sweet spot' of invention in the central-extreme novelty space, with a statistical analysis of approximately 600,000 patents in the USPTO database. This finding supports the prior conjecture from engineering design research (Fu et al 2013). Knowledge of the specified sweet spot may further enable data-driven methods for assessing novelty and profiling inventors.‚Ä¶‚Äù

----------------------------------------------------------------
‚Äú‚Ä¶Not only are more ideas generated with near stimuli, but also inspired internal search seems to promote abstract thought that would typically be associated with productive problem solving. One explanation for this is that the near stimuli from the present work might actually occupy a space similar to the "sweet spot" proposed by Fu et al [5]. A more accurate description of the near and far conditions from this work may be "closer" and "further".‚Ä¶‚Äù

----------------------------------------------------------------
‚Äú‚Ä¶Results in this paper further suggest that in the given context, concepts generated using patents from the far field or the combination of the home and far fields have a higher average quality than the concepts stimulated by patents from other individual fields or combinations. This seems to contradict the findings of Fu et al (2013b) that solutions generated using stimuli from near sources had higher quality than those generated using far sources, but support the findings of Chan et al (2011) that stimuli from far sources were more beneficial for developing solutions of higher quality. However, these studies and ours might not be comparable, primarily because the characterization of near and far is not the same.‚Ä¶‚Äù
