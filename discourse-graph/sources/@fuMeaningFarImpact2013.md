        - #Claim Somewhat-far analogies strike the best balance between novelty and quality

        - two key results:

            - [[EVD - participants who received computationally selected far analogical stimuli had a lower ceiling...s compared to participants who received near or no analogical stimuli - @fuMeaningFarImpact2013]]

            - [[EVD - when placed in the same semantic space, computationally selected near and far analogical stim...m human-selected near and far analogical stimuli for the same problem - @fuMeaningFarImpact2013]]
