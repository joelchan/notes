- [[Karen Wickett]] makes a connection to [[@orrTalkingMachinesEthnography1996]], talks about the triangle of customer-technician-machine

    - producing documents in technician role as a way of documenting their expertise - development of [[professional identity]] - possible motivations to dig into as well for [[scholar-powered model of semantic publishing]]??

        - parallels to us here too in terms of issue of [[intellectual property]] - trading files on an individual basis with trusted peers, vs. an "event emergency [[epistemology]]", sharing to a giant public repository

            - possible connections to [[[[QUE]] - How can we best bridge private vs. public knowledge?]]

                - [[Andrea Thomer]] suggests: I wonder if there’s not some work about that in the [[paratext]] literature - on the ownership of marginalia

                    - concept is very related to that of [[annotation]], e.g., [[in-source annotations]]

                - [[Nic Weber]] says I guess to clarify - I was thinking about what governs the construction of or justification of knowledge in a particular event… I would guess this event is governed by IP in important ways - for example https://www.wired.com/story/right-to-repair-medical-equipment-ifixit/ describes how there is a need to relax restrictions around repairing equipment and sharing information about how to effectively repair equipment during a shortage exacerbated by COVID 19

                    - Just as a comment, the "right to tinker" is sometimes what Doctorow at EFF and others use for this right: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/why-owning-your-stuff-means-owning-your-digital-freedom
Another point is tht there have long been attempts to replace PDF itself at the W3C, but it never really worked out: https://www.w3.org/publishing/ They also have DRM hooks in the open standard :)

            - could be quite different from sharing of *data* ([[open data]])
