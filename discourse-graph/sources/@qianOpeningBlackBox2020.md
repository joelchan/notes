            - Did semi-structured contextual interviews with beginning interdisciplinary scholars.

                - Scholars varied substantially in the [[ecology of tools]] used for [[synthesis]]: no single tool was used to encompass every (sub)task, and few tools were common across all scholars.

- **Informs::** [[QUE - How might we characterize scientists' synthesis practices from a processtool perspective]]

[[QUE - How might we characterize scientists' synthesis practices from a processtool perspective]]

- Yet, there are some hints of optimal paths, that on closer analysis, seem to align with the epistemic models [[@qianOpeningBlackBox2020]] [[@chanWhereRubberMeets2020]]

    - [[Desire Path]] in [[[[CLM]] - Effective individual synthesis systems (seem to mostly) exist (for a select few)]]

        - What we see now is not infrastructure for synthesis. Instead, we see people either resort to all sorts of "hacks" and workarounds, or put in a substantial amount of work to "mine" publications for what they need (for an evocative example of this, see [[@knightEnslavedTrappedData2019]]). We have a whole cottage industry that is dedicated to fueling workarounds of this sort, for systematic reviewing. While these hacks often work well enough for the task at hand, they are rarely transferred in systematic ways across projects and people, violating the dimensions of "reach or scope" and "embodiment of standards", laid out by [[@starStepsEcologyInfrastructure1996]].

- 23:14 #fieldnotes thread from academia channel on [[sys/Obsidian]] discord, reminiscent of [[@qianOpeningBlackBox2020]] intermediate products, and also the importance of preserving [[context]] in notes, and granular backlinks to context snippets

    - AlexAMGToday at 5:43 AM

    - I just use Backlinks on specific keywords and then when a node has enough backlinks I will create a summary page for it.

    - I would rather let literature reviews be linked via concepts and topics as opposed to "[[Paper X]] talks about [[Y]] and [[Paper Z]]] also talks about [[Y]]"

    - In Paper X :

        - " - [[Authors]] have found that [[Y]] correlates very strongly with the property [[T]]"

    - In Paper Z:

    - "- I don't agree with how this study has analysed their properties of [[Y]], I think they should be done using method [[M]]. "

    - And then in the [[Y]] Node:

    - Definition of Y [[Source]]

    - Two studies discussed this property however they are in disagreement because of difference in methodology.

    - ![[block ref Paper X]]

    - vs

    - ![[block ref Paper Y]]

    - argentumToday at 5:53 AM

    - that's a nice idea :thinking: I tend to approach this differently because I might read X and Y at different times, I might play around with creating the concept pages when I'm doing the review and adding the relevant blocks then

    - otherwise my brain will forget stuff

    - AlexAMGToday at 5:55 AM

    - Ah! That's exactly the point why I do this way.

    - I could read paper X today and paper Z in about 3 months ... The links are not to one another but to the concept, and so when the concept has enough links I can start building it out as a thing, until then it will just exist as a dormant backlink.

    - brimwats (they/m)Today at 5:55 AM

    - I have a seperate part of my PKB where I build out the things in the zotero folder. the scholar pages (f.ex) act as like a wikipage where I can reference them throughout my pkb and it always points there

        - like so

    - AlexAMGToday at 5:56 AM

    - That's a neat idea!

    - I just use mendeley to store my papers and they only touch my PKM once I've read them, written notes  on the paper and added the annotated PDF to an "Attachments" folder

    - brimwats (they/m)Today at 5:59 AM

    - thats fair, my workflow is very zotero specific. I make obsidian notes in zotero notes so when they get exported by @argentum's plugin they end up in zotero

    - when I annotate PDFs for example I'll do like [[British Columbia]] if it is a topic in the paper

    - i also use various hiligher colors to mean different things

    - argentumToday at 6:01 AM

    - Now I'm curious about this! The notes in Publication are per paper? Or is this something else?

    - Scholar == authors, right?

    - @brimwats (they/m) haha I like this organization

    - brimwats (they/m)Today at 6:02 AM

    - publication = journal or book or conference proceedings

    - argentumToday at 6:02 AM

    - Do you use mostly the backlinks there? or do you have a sample note you can share?

    - brimwats (they/m)Today at 6:03 AM

    - My per paper notes are done in zotero and then exported. so like this. I can use ] litno (no space obvs) to create the template in zotero notes, then your plugin exports it to obsidian

    - brimwats (they/m)Today at 6:03 AM

    - for scholars or for publications?

    - it's backlinks for the most part but am building them out as I go. For example:

    - argentumToday at 6:07 AM

    - I'm just curious how you use those two, so far I haven't added any content of my own to those two types of pages, unless I e.g. have met the person (before covid) and added some notes about that

    - brimwats (they/m)Today at 6:07 AM

    - the descriptions of work is what other people have described their work as

    - I should [[]] the Itza bc she's got an author page too

    - but yeah, and for a journal publication I might put things that they tend to cover, good or bad things I know about the editor(s); ideas I could pitch to them

    - argentumToday at 6:09 AM

    - @brimwats (they/m) damn brim! I like this a lot! As usual, you've given me a few ideas to reorganize things :sweat_smile:

    - brimwats (they/m)Today at 6:09 AM

    - sorry not sorry :kissing_heart:

    - i suppose i should put together a forum post about this sometime /sigh

    - argentumToday at 6:11 AM

    - for now I can pin your screenshot

    - argentum

        - pinned

    - a message

        - to this channel.

    - See all the pins.

    - Today at 6:11 AM

    - argentumToday at 6:13 AM

    - also @AlexAMG thanks! I like your approach, will steal some of it

    - brimwats (they/m)Today at 6:13 AM

    - yeah I need to do more of what @AlexAMG is talking about there, it sounds useful and that it would integrate well

    - ryanjamurphyToday at 7:27 AM

    - Thanks folks. @AlexAMG's idea seems obvious in retrospect: you can't catch the real links if you don't actually process the notes and codify them around whatever matters to you.

    - I can imagine using this with key ideas in my research streams, then creating maps of those ideas according to different research questions, etc.

    - Neat!

    - AlexAMGToday at 8:09 AM

    - Yeah, This is why only thing I have read or have something to say about go into my PKM that way I can highlight keywords of interest. Plus you can always use the unlinked mentioned down the road if you think you've not linked a specific topic if you all of a sudden want to change focus of your research etc.

    - This is what things typically look like for me.

    - I try to use the Tags and Techniques Used section in order to capture higher level keywords that might not be of interest to me right now but might relevant later down the road

    - Axeler8erToday at 8:20 AM

    - Hello.

    - I have a question: is it possible to add images inside notes?

    - SilverToday at 8:37 AM

    - are those annotations? :eyes:

    - @AlexAMG

    - SilverToday at 8:38 AM

    - yes, try searching "image" in help vault

    - Axeler8erToday at 8:39 AM

    - Thank you for the tip

    - brimwats (they/m)Today at 11:02 AM

    - not to speak for Alex but those are what my annotations look like!

    - AlexAMGToday at 11:09 AM

    - Yeah PDF annotations :slight_smile:

    - I sit with my tablet and a coffee while I read the paper, ya know to be extra , highlight and make notes and then I process them into Obsidian to make them useful :slight_smile:

    - Anything copied from the text goes into the Quotes section (backlinks) are added to relevant words, and any comments/discussions I make in the comment section :slight_smile:

    - brimwats (they/m)Today at 11:18 AM

    - @AlexAMG I know you said you use mendeley but it's a automated in Zotero if that's a tempt at all :laughing:

    - Goran S.üë®üè´Today at 11:49 AM

    - Can you tell me why are you using comments and annotations on pdf? I can understand if you read a lot on tablet but on PC just why!? Why not have pdf on left and take your notes on right side of screen.

    - btw. Can Obsidian be always on top (like OneNote is) cos of this reason - taking fast note will reading books/web?

    - AlexAMGToday at 11:57 AM

    - To answer both @Goran S.üë®üè´ and @brimwats (they/m) , I think the inconvenience and manual aspect of reading on tablet/annotating PDF and then translating that into Notes on obsidian is my process of distilling the information.

    - brimwats (they/m)Today at 11:58 AM

    - thats fair enough! sticking with things that works is more often the best strategy

    - AlexAMGToday at 11:58 AM

    - In the reading stage I focus on just digesting and understanding, after that comes the processing and articulating in my own words

    - very true

    - I found a couple of times that if I leave a few days between reading and writing up my notes I actually find new insights into the paper or the results. Maybe the subconscious is doing the work? Maybe actually spending 40 mins reading a scientific paper is dull as hell so your brain needs a chance to come back to it ? Maybe I am just a bit weird. Probably a combination of all 3.

    - argentumToday at 12:03 PM

    - For me it's about preserving the context. I used to write my notes like that before, but then depending on how I had paraphrased + how long had it been since I read it, I couldn't trace back to which part of the paper I was referring to. You can copy the quote from the pdf and then make your note below... but then all of that starts being a bit boring and something that could be automated

    - argentumToday at 12:04 PM

    - This happens to me too! It might be all 3 for me as well, but I think there's also a bit of context... I might be reading things a certain way depending on what I'm looking for at that moment which might be all in my head unless I add it to the notes

    - that's why I was thinking I'll create the concept notes when I do the review, that forces me a bit to include these invisible things that also have some influence on what I wrote that I might not see the next time (even 3 days later) I'm looking at that paper

    - AlexAMGToday at 12:10 PM

    - @argentum that's why it's important to make decent anchor notes when you're reading. Cause yeah otherwise I forget what I read or what I was thinking at the time.

    - But When I process I just go through my annotation and highlights and I typically use a colouring system. Yellow = Notes/Discussion points. Green = Useful statements. Purple = Techniques to look up. Red= "This looks like BS"

    - ryanjamurphyToday at 12:11 PM

    - @Silver My readings often look worse (better) than that

    - @Goran S.üë®üè´ When I export my highlights they contain direct links to the pages they are from

    - Love doing "this is BS" annotations

    - argentumToday at 12:12 PM

    - yeah, this is what I do currently too and the annotations have links to the page (and the highlight provides the some context too)

    - color coding also helps a lot!

    - Might be a field thing, but this also has helped me find sometimes unwritten assumptions by the authors of a paper

    - On the first pass it all sounds fine and dandy, but once I'm a bit deeper and/or implementing stuff you can find "oh... funny, they forgot to mention X"

    - AlexAMGToday at 12:15 PM

    - Very true!

    - The "They forgot to mention X " is normally a big sign that shit is about to hit the fan

    - argentumToday at 12:15 PM

    - Then I can go back and check, did I misunderstand (is my note wrong?) or is that not mentioned in the paper?

    - AlexAMGToday at 12:17 PM

    - Yeah I think I will have to think further how to pull papers through at the moment I've not read enough of them/found anything I am going to work from, so everything is just a garden (Seedlings = initial passes , Gardens = Processed and noted up, Woods = part of a larger collection of literature) (idea borrowed :wink:  from @tallguyjenks (he/him) )

    - This is why i like engaging with this community, just to see how other people are doing things and get some inspiration and see what works for me :nerd:

    - tallguyjenks (he/him)Today at 12:33 PM

    - Jeet Kune Do method, take liberally from others, discard what doesn't work, keep what does, and add what is uniquely your own.

    - What works for me likely wont work for most in it entirety, but if a piece of it works for you then by all means steal away :slight_smile:
