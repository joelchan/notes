        - Abstract

            - This paper examines how legacies of thinking about ontology, logic, and how best to approach knowledge representation have become interwoven in the architecture of the technologies that enable a Semantic Web. As a cultural anthropologist, I approach this study with qualitative historical and ethnographic methodologies, positioning the community of researchers that have been involved in the design and implementation of Semantic Web protocols and technologies as my primary field site. Two concepts from Science and Technology Studies are introduced - thought styles and design logics. The paper demonstrates how diverse thinking about how to approach knowledge representation on the Web is rooted in debates that emerged in artificial intelligence in the 1970s and 1980s. It then goes on to discuss how the diverse approaches to Web semantics that emerged from these legacies have cultural and political implications. The paper concludes with a call for further research that positions Web architectures as objects of social and cultural study.

        - ethnographic history of "schools of thought" in [[Semantic Web]] (including the various flavors of [[std/OWL]]

        - draws out a distinction between "neat" and "scruffy" styles of thought that reflect fundamentally different philosophies about [[knowledge representation]]: roughly speaking, the "neat" style maps to [[first-order predicate logic]] and is probably the first thing people think of when they hear the term [[ontologies]]: emphasis on capital R reasoning (correctness, trustworthiness, verifiability, deductive logics, etc.), and the "scruffy" style maps more towards pragmatic, contextual, fuzzy, statistics-oriented approach to knowledge representation.

        - industry [[Semantic Web]] practice has mostly taken a turn for the "scruffy", exemplified in efforts like [[std/schema.org]], while the "neat" style sort of lives on in academic work.

            - implication: be careful in making the critique that [[[[CLM]] - Universal Semantic Webs are neither feasible nor useful]]: not all [[ontologies]] are equal, and some are "scruffier" than others (cc [[[[CLM]] - Distinction between neat vs scruffy in Semantic Web engineering]]) and more amenable to the complexities of the {{alias: [[[[CLM]] - Knowledge is fundamentally contextual]] contextual nature of knowledge}}
