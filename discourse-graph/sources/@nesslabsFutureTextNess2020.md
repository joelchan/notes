- Came across [[@nesslabsFutureTextNess2020]] via [[Anne-Laure Le Cunff]] from the [[Digital Gardeners Telegram group]]

    - Seems to be a fun portal into the hypertext world in Europe (mostly), including the [[Knowledge Media Institute]], and even [[sys/Scholarcy]], but with roots in [[Ted Nelson]] and [[Doug Engelbart]]

        - see, e.g., the speaker line up at the [[conf/Future of Text]] from [[2019]]: http://thefutureoftext.org/2019.html

    - Significant to me that both in the [[std/Visual Meta]] [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDRZj_c5dyM&list=PLYx4DnFWaXV_7q3NBlJjxIQL8L5zC_Dcs&index=6) and in [[sys/Scholarcy]] [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seMbANwJwoQ&list=PLYx4DnFWaXV_7q3NBlJjxIQL8L5zC_Dcs&index=9), there is a shard sense of needing to [[[[PTN]] - Prefer to accrete new infrastructures on top of existing ones]] (specifically PDFs and publishing practices), eschewing the goal of authors doing [[semantic publishing]] *instead* of publishing papers.

    - I also *really* like how [[std/Visual Meta]] directly builds on top of bibtex and json, two stable and widely adopted standards in academic work, and aspires for the approach to be a "glue" between diverse applications, rather than working only within a specific toolset. This too is similar to what we want to do with [[D/Synthesis Infrastructure]]

    - See demo of [[std/Visual Meta]] here:

        - system described in [[@heglandVisualMetaApproachSurfacing2019]]
