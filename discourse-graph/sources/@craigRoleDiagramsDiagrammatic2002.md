        - Abstract

            - We argue that problem solvers can, in certain cases, solve target problems by transforming perceptual simulations of solutions to analogous source problems. We further argue that source diagrams may facilitate the process, but only if they convey physical affordances consistent with the necessary transformations. We conducted an exploratory study in which participants were asked to solve a source and a target problem. We identified two properties of extemporaneously drawn source diagrams view and configuration that were highly correlated with the production of analogous solutions to the target problem. We speculated that view and configuration influenced the ease with which certain simulated transformations were performed. The results of two additional experiments in which the view and configuration of source diagrams were independently controlled further support the claim.
