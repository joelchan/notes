- Title:: How Florist Apprentices Explore Bouquet Designs: Supporting Design Space Exploration for Vocational Students
- Author(s):: [[Kevin Gonyop Kim]]
- Abstract:: Context: Exploring the design space is an important process in a design task. In this study, we considered design space exploration for the learners in vocational education and training (VET). The goal of the study was to investigate how they explore the design space while focusing on the effect of a graph-like interface on the learnerâ€™s understanding of the design space. With florists as the target profession, we investigated how the apprentices explore design variations, what they would gain from such activity, and how we can support this process.
