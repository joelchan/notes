        - Abstract

            - [Systematic reviews]([[systematic review]]) provide more than just a summary of the research literature related to a particular topic or question--rather they offer clear and compelling answers to questions related to the ‚Äùwho,‚Äù "why," and "when" of studies. In this chapter, the authors draw on their experiences with systematic reviews‚Äîone as an editor of a highly regarded educational research journal, the other as a researcher and review author‚Äîto trace the growing popularity of systematic reviews in education literature and to pose a series of challenges to aspiring review authors to motivate and enliven their work. In particular, the authors stress the importance of melding scientific and rigorous review procedures with 'stylish' academic writing that engages its audience through effective storytelling, attention to context (the people, places, policies, and practices represented in the studies under review), and clear implications for research and practice.

    - often see a lack of critical appraisal, insight, and discussion of heterogeneity, in submitted manuscripts (contra [[@strikeTypesSynthesisTheir1983]] Three intellectual standards for (good) synthesis (p356 onwards), and the [importance (and lack of) of critical appraisal](((-WYQv2Cnn))) laid out in [[@holbrookLevelsSuccessUse2008]])
