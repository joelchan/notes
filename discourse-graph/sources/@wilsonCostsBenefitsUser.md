        - [Cross-sectional ](A [cross-sectional study](((v1O0fXZjI))) using particpants from North America and Europe was conducted using 2 questionnaires. )results found 15 out of 25 projects had [user involvement](((HfFbpzK2d))) with a varying degree of cost-benefit ratios. In all cases with user involvement the perceived benefits outweighed the costs.

        - [Cross-sectional](A [cross-sectional study](((v1O0fXZjI))) using particpants from North America and Europe was conducted using 2 questionnaires. ) results highlighted that in projects which [did not involve users](((gv3x5TpR_))) very little benefits were perceived if any at all. However, there were less costs associated with the projects.

        - [Cross-sectional](A [cross-sectional study](((v1O0fXZjI))) using particpants from North America and Europe was conducted using 2 questionnaires. ) results showed that during [Preparation Activities](((BM5A2DrZp))) of the design process issues arose from a lack of understanding on user's behalf of the design process and a lack of consensus among users.

        - [Cross-sectional](A [cross-sectional study](((v1O0fXZjI))) using particpants from North America and Europe was conducted using 2 questionnaires. ) results showed that during [Design activities](((GjimKL18X))) designers perceived a cost because of issues with opposing views between users and struggled with finding a compromise.

        - [Cross-sectional](A [cross-sectional study](((v1O0fXZjI))) using particpants from North America and Europe was conducted using 2 questionnaires. ) results showed that during [evaluation activities](((lEhj9IIFM))) users had an issue with understanding technical limitations (Length of time it takes to modify and expectations of user friendliness) of the software being worked on.

        - The overall analysis of the [Cross-sectional](A [cross-sectional study](((v1O0fXZjI))) using particpants from North America and Europe was conducted using 2 questionnaires. ) study determined the primary cost was that user groups wanted things that were to specific which meant there were too many user groups.

Questions asked were again about the design process and users were not informed about the interest in user participation.) showed that during the preparation activities the [costs](((Se-Md0UH9))) were in relation to the time and effort of educating the users about the design process. They also found that designers had a misunderstanding of the user. However, the designers also listed many [benefits](((Se-Md0UH9))) of spending time with a user before the study began.
