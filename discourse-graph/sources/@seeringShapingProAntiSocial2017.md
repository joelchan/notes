- Title:: Shaping Pro and Anti-Social Behavior on Twitch Through Moderation and Example-Setting
- Author(s):: [[Joseph Seering]], [[Robert Kraut]], [[Laura Dabbish]]
- Abstract:: Online communities have the potential to be supportive, cruel, or anywhere in between. The development of positive norms for interaction can help users build bonds, grow, and learn. Using millions of messages sent in Twitch chatrooms, we explore the effectiveness of methods for encouraging and discouraging specific behaviors, including taking advantage of imitation effects through setting positive examples and using moderation tools to discourage antisocial behaviors. Consistent with aspects of imitation theory and deterrence theory, users imitated examples of behavior that they saw, and more so for behaviors from high status users. Proactive moderation tools, such as chat modes which restricted the ability to post certain content, proved effective at discouraging spam behaviors, while reactive bans were able to discourage a wider variety of behaviors. This work considers the intersection of tools, authority, and types of behaviors, offering a new frame through which to consider the development of moderation strategies.

- Reading [[@seeringShapingProAntiSocial2017]] to explore whether bans make sense.. Our moderator-in-residence says it can work.

    - Looks like they found that [[[[EVD]] - viewers in Twitch chat engaged in less bad behaviors after a user was banned by a moderator for that bad behavior - [[@seeringShapingProAntiSocial2017]]]]

        - note! they actually measured and banned three types of behaviors (spam, questions, and smiles), not necessarily just bad behaviors in general. the important thing is the attenuation/reversal or imitation that happened after an event + ban, vs. event without ban
