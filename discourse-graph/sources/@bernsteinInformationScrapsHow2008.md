- Title:: Information Scraps: How and Why Information Eludes Our Personal Information Management Tools
- Author(s):: [[Michael Bernstein]], [[Max Van Kleek]], [[David Karger]], [[M. C. Schraefel]]
- Abstract:: In this article we investigate information scrapsâ€”personal information where content has been scribbled on Post-it notes, scrawled on the corners of sheets of paper, stuck in our pockets, sent in email messages to ourselves, and stashed in miscellaneous digital text files. Information scraps encode information ranging from ideas and sketches to notes, reminders, shipment tracking numbers, driving directions, and even poetry. Although information scraps are ubiquitous, we have much still to learn about these loose forms of information practice. Why do we keep information scraps outside of our traditional PIM applications? What role do information scraps play in our overall information practice? How might PIM applications be better designed to accommodate and support information scraps' creation, manipulation and retrieval? We pursued these questions by studying the information scrap practices of 27 knowledge workers at five organizations. Our observations shed light on information scraps' content, form, media, and location. From this data, we elaborate on the typical information scrap lifecycle, and identify common roles that information scraps play: temporary storage, archiving, work-in-progress, reminding, and management of unusual data. These roles suggest a set of unmet design needs in current PIM tools: lightweight entry, unconstrained content, flexible use and adaptability, visibility, and mobility.

    - The **opportunity cost** of having a formalism that excludes really really important elements, is too high to adopt for creative knowledge work

        - This is a subset or specific instantiation of the general [[[[CLM]] - (premature) formalism considered harmful]]

        - In this case, a formalism that excludes speculation, for example, or rough scraps that we don't know what to do with yet, will prematurely kill the creative process

            - Really hitting the theme of how important it is to have the informal live alongside the formal: asked about [[abduction]], and where that lives in here - my sense is that [[[[PTN]] - discourse graph]] don't represent abduction, but support it (by having something to talk back to); similar to [[Chinmay Kulkarni]]'s question about speculation

            - {{embed: Another goes back to the idea of how we can best evaluate interventions into the creative process, knowing that it is a complex dynamical system that is constantly in flux. ((need to refactor this high-level zettelkasten: [[[[CLM]] - Ideas develop simultaneously at multiple timescales, levels of granularity, and completeness]]) A myopic focus on "did it give me something right now that I can recognize as immediately useful" is very dangerous.}}

        - [[@ackermanIntellectualChallengeCSCW2000]] throughout this piece i am mentally translating "social activity" for "sensemaking" or "creative knowledge work" or "synthesis" - e.g., "{social activity | synthesis work} is fluid and nuanced, and this makes systems technically difficult to construct properly and often awkward to use" (p. 181)
