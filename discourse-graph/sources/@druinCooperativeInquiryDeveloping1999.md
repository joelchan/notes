        - Abstract

            - In todays homes and schools, children are emerging as frequent and experienced users of technology [3, 14]. As this trend continues, it becomes increasingly important to ask if we are fulfilling the technology needs of our children. To answer this question, I have developed a research approach that enables young children to have a voice throughout the technology development process. In this paper, the techniques of cooperative inquiry will be described along with a theoretical framework that situates this work in the HCI literature. Two examples of technology resulting from this approach will be presented, along with a brief discussion on the design-centered learning of team researchers using cooperative inquiry.

- [[Cooperative Inquiry]], per [[@druinCooperativeInquiryDeveloping1999]]: expansive! children are full design partners. KidPad is proof-of-concept of the value of the approach (more flexible and creative than they would have suspected with children only as user and tester)
