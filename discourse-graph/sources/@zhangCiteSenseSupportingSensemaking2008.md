- Reading notes

    - There is a model, but still kind of "black-boxy" and not as granular to the task of synthesis as we would like (partially bc includes other stuff like [[ðŸ§± foraging]] and task management) #Claim

        - "organize" collected information? -> is it for transactional understanding?

        - "compose" literature review?

        - what is the basis of this model?

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FnbbnQcKcJj?alt=media&token=3cdeb49d-3f9e-40cc-99e8-8bd2666e3ea6)

    - An intergral lit-reviewing scenario

        - #appraisal [[synthesis]] is compressed into a description of taking notes on papers, categorizing/grouping papers, and then composing a review based on collection and personal notes, and lumped into the larger flow of [[ðŸ§± foraging]]

    - [[Xin Qian]]'s notes

        - The paper focuses on an **integral** analysis and interface of "literature reviewing". Our focus of **synthesis** is a part of it. Besides, the paper does not mention the term of **synthesis** as we do.

        - Therefore, it identifies three key tasks (to be supported) in "literature reviewing" (P678)

            - Seek,

            - Appraise, comprehend, and compose;

                - #appraisal Although it involves "organizing collected information" and "note-taking", little discussion is about how the organization and notes from users are becoming useful for a long-term goal of doing a literature-reviewing.

            - **Task management** (in which "export sensemaking results" is close to what we mean as "synthesis")

        - Correspondingly, the CiteSense system has three spaces in terms of spatial design, to support abovementioned tasks

            - Query space (for seek)

            - Context space, the reference/citation/domain classification system (for appraise, comprehend)

            - **Working space** (for task management, and probably **what we mean as synthesis**)

                - Drag and drop papers into the space

                - Creating and manipulate the collection (informally cluster, hierarchical sectioniong)

                - Draft personal notes on papers

                - Export the final results

        - Among the key tasks, and spatial designs, we are most interested in **task management and working space**. Moreover, the paper discuss lightly about what persist for future use and how the system make them useful, after the users finish a sessional usage of the system. We analyze through a **longitudinal lens** (more than transient/ephermeral) of literature reviewing.
