        - Abstract

            - The dual goals of efﬁciency and effectiveness when writing a literature review are considered. Effectiveness is concerned with producing a [[synthesis]] of the published knowledge. A systematic approach to reviewing is at best a partial approach to efﬁciency because the foundations of the academic publishing system are rigidly locked into old technology. An outline for redesigning academic publishing to jump literature reviewing efﬁciency to a new level and enhance the productivity of many other aspects of scholarship is proposed.
