        - It's not paper per se, but the ease with which people can develop/express their fluid interactions with the texts

            - Again, cf. [[[[CLM]] - Gracefully integrating formalism into interactive systems is hard]]

- Many of these in isolation are not new! Lots of beautifully detailed work in [[active reading]]; see as far back as #[[@oharaStudentReadersUse1998]] for rich examples, or even... as far back as [[Charles Darwin]] and, arguably, as old as external representations ;). What we see here is a different lens with which to view these data, to consider what these behaviors (could) do.

    - The sophistication of the *system* (vs. the medium or tool) might explain [[[[CLM]] - Analog media are stubbornly effective for supporting creative knowledge work]]
