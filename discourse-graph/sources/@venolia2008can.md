- Title:: Can we make "Distance Matter" less?
- Author(s):: [[Gina Venolia]]
- Abstract:: Geographically distributed teams are increasingly common, yet present several challenges when compared to collocated teams – or as Judy and Gary Olson famously observed, "distance matters." Our studies of collocated and distributed software development teams have revealed challenges in four key activities: communication in planned meetings, ad-hoc conversations, staying aware of teammates and their work, and building trust relationships between teammates. I will present observations of how collocated teammates do each of these activities, the special problems faced by remote teammates, and how remote teammates mitigate these challenges. I will identify several opportunities where new tools could make the remote experience more like – or even better than – the collocated experience, and go into detail on one potential design.

- [[Notes]]

    - This is a presentation that I gave at UC Irvine summarizing the research my group has done that relates to distributed development.
- a 2008 study that examined the special problems faced by remote teammates at Microsoft.
- Her work revealed challenges in four key areas:

    - communication in planned meetings,

    - ad-hoc conversations,

    - awareness of teammates and their work, and

    - building trust relationships between teammates.

Olson 2002]
