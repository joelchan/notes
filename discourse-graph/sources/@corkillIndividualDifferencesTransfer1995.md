        - Abstract

            - This study e xamined the relative contribution of four individual difference variables to ability to solve analogically related problems in four separate problem sequences and for spontaneous and assisted transfer. Experiment 1 inves- tigated the relationships between problem sources and targets, the familiarity of problem sources and targets, and the degree to which subjects spontaneously provided a particular solution to two target problems. Experiment 2 tested whether comb ations of individual difference variables served as significant predictors of probIem solving success in four different source-target problem sequences. For both spontaneous and assisted transfer, the results indicated that under certain circum- stances different combinations of the tndividual difference variables were contrib- uting to ability to predict whether a subject would provide a particular solution to a target problem. The results are discussed in terms of why the individual difference variables enhance prediction for transfer only under certain conditions.
