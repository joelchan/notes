- Really inspired by the idea of [[Passive-Dynamic Walkers]] (#example-of [[Morphological Computation]] and [[distributed cognition]]), and how that relates to [[Tools for Thought]], while reading [[@clarkSupersizingMindEmbodiment2010]] A few key observations that stand out to me:

    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F7qSiPXLkxI.png?alt=media&token=8f35e497-6191-46da-9ef3-3827e9350df3)

    - Integrating with the environment (broadly construed) makes the primary task almost effortless: compare the cost of transport for humans to the robot: it's an order of magnitude less! What could that look like for [[synthesis]]? Where are we on the spectrum of possible [[ðŸ§± cost structure]]s?

- These empirical and design insights have grounding in the idea that cognition is embodied, situated, and distributed [[@clarkSupersizingMindEmbodiment2010]], [[@klemmerHowBodiesMatter2006]], [[@hollanDistributedCognitionNew2000]], [[@greenoSituativityKnowingLearning1998]]: cognitive processes are not just "influenced by" tools and environments and embodied states; they are also "implemented" in a distributed "hardware", of which the brain is but one component alongside other materials such as other people, tools, and the structure of one's environment.

    - Evocative example of [[Passive-Dynamic Walkers]] to give a sense of the magnitude of potential gains from a requirement-environment fit for thinking!
