- Also realizing there's a fun goldmine of episodes on [[RationallySpeaking]], including one excellent [discussion]([[@galefJamesEvansUsing]]) with [[James A. Evans]] on [[metaknowledge]]!

    - Some interesting nuggets (need to follow up on the papers)

        - Science and invention have different dynamics, apparently..

            - Broadly, the [[Burden of Knowledge]] phenomenon shows up for science, but not invention

                - Probably referencing [[@jonesBurdenKnowledgeDeath2009]], and a bunch of related papers on [[Z: Good ideas are getting harder to find]]

            - The latter... might follow more of the [[adjacent possible]] trajectory, where innovation kind of gets... easier over time?

                - No source for this yet, though

            - Reminds me of the [[fundamental distinction between make and understand]]

                - See. e.g., Teasing out the design vs. science ([make vs. understand](((6k9bvnMfa)))) [distinction]([[fundamental distinction between make and understand]]), with implications for [[D/Computational Analogy]] - this FEELS IMPORTANT  [[[[interval]]:32.7]] [[[[factor]]:2.30]] [[April 27th, 2021]]

        - Scientists do more iterative work (but not [[replication]]!), rather than exploratory work, which ends up being VERY inefficient on a systems level for discovery, but very cost-effective for individual scientists from a career risk/cost perspective

            - Feel like I've maybe seen this already?

                - Feels like [[@fosterTraditionInnovationScientists2015]], but James mentions [[PNAS]]?

            - Definitely relevant for [[[[CLM]] - Prevailing incentives in academia are bad for science]], specifically [[[[CL]] - Scientists prefer to pursue safer incremental advances rather than risky breakthroughs]]

            - Snapshots

        - Ambiguity in language can be helpful for integrating work: even [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Thomas Kuhn]] were examples of work where language was ambiguous, and this ended up having positive effects on the science

            - Reminds me of [[paradigmatic relevance]]

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FOvNOEBiRp_.png?alt=media&token=24a36dfc-f155-4063-adb0-3a691215a038)

            - But also maybe [[[[CL]] - Multiplicity is necessary for synthesis]]

            - And in any case, [[James A. Evans]]'s observation that it was more tractable to do his kind of science of science work in the harder sciences (due to less ambiguity of terms) suggests that [[[[CLM]] - Universal Semantic Webs are neither feasible nor useful]] might be especially true of domains that are different from the harder sciences, where [[paradigmatic relevance]] might be more prominent

        - Jargon can be quite bad in terms of separating fields

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FUJhO8xB2Oc.png?alt=media&token=fbb2fe79-67ef-4811-b4eb-7b6914bf2833)

        - But sometimes you want fields ot be more separate, for more independent search

            - Reminds me of [[Zollman Effect]]

                - Which actually is quite relevant for [[D/Solution-Diversity]], insofar as the hypothesized benefits of reduced sharing is diversity in bets

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FaV7HdeH1mI.png?alt=media&token=57616756-66a0-43bd-b9b8-d21e1e20b717)

        - Mentions the idea of [[ghost theories]], which is related to [[Ghost Theorems]], I think

            - Sourced back to [[@smailDeepHistoryBrain2007]]

                - Back to the source itself, the concept of [[ghost theories]] isn't super well-defined, just sort of loosely invoked to explain resistance to the author's unorthodox ideas about the connection between history and biology (or "deep history")

                    - AFAIK, can trace it to two sections of the book:

                        - p3-4

                            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FNnQ1IDbzB2.png?alt=media&token=a13f58a5-3f79-4784-9507-f9e07970d540) (p. 3)

                            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FAQZ5JdXaGU.png?alt=media&token=68871863-7589-4e22-b474-c8886e2e815a) (p. 4)

                        - p42-43

                            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FhLuR39oXHC.png?alt=media&token=ed78d338-0bf5-40f8-a225-6e2231fe19db)

                - At first glance from title, seemed like a mistake?

                    - And googling doesn't really show up much

                        - Except this random section in this book on cognitive archaeology, which extends this as an observation on science in general, even though the book is not in any way set up to test or advance that claim!
