[[QUE - How susceptible are young children to COVID-19 infection, given equivalent exposure]]

- There are still open [objections/limitations]([[Opposed By]]) to consider (see [[@hydeDifferenceSARSCoV2Attack2021]] for a review)

    - Lower prevalence of COVID in children might be [explained by underreporting of mild and asymptomatic cases]([[[[CLM]] - Lower prevalence of COVID in children might be explained by underreporting of mild and asymptomatic cases]]).

        - [Rebuttal]([[Opposed By]]):

            - A valid concern! But we do have a number of contact tracing studies with exhaustive testing [[@somekhRoleChildrenDynamics2020]([[[[EVD]] - 2x lower secondary attack rate for children compared to adults in exhaustive contact tracing study of 13 families in Central Israel - [[@somekhRoleChildrenDynamics2020]]]]), [@jingHouseholdSecondaryAttack2020]([[[[EVD]] - 30 percent lower household secondary attack rate for children vs. adults, ~2x lower than older adults, in Guangzhou - [[@jingHouseholdSecondaryAttack2020]]]]), [@liCharacteristicsHouseholdTransmission2020]([[[[EVD]] - 5x lower secondary attack rate for children compared to adults in households in China - [[@liCharacteristicsHouseholdTransmission2020]]]])] that find similarly lower estimates of susceptibility for children as other studies that don't have exhaustive testing, and also a modeling study with adjustments for underreporting of cases [[@dattnerRoleChildrenSpread2020]([[[[EVD]] - Model of PCR data in Israel adjusted for under-detection of cases find 2x lower prevalence for children vs. adults - [[@dattnerRoleChildrenSpread2020]]]])]

    - Lower prevalence of COVID in children might be [explained by significantly muted contact patterns in children vs. adults during the pandemic, due to school closures]([[[[CLM]] - Lower prevalence of COVID in children might be explained by significantly muted contact patterns in children vs. adults during the pandemic, due to school closures]])

        - [Rebuttal]([[Opposed By]]):

            - This is hard to rule out completely, but we do have some studies that have similar/equated exposure rates for adults vs. children, in schools [[@heaveyNoEvidenceSecondary2020]([[[[EVD]] - No secondary cases amongst 1k symptomatic close contacts of 6 index cases in school in Ireland - [[@heaveyNoEvidenceSecondary2020]]]]), [@yungNovelCoronavirus20192020]([[@yungNovelCoronavirus20192020]])]

            - Household contact studies are also important if testing is exhaustive and index cases are caregivers, since contact patterns with potential infectious individuals would be *higher* for children! And here we still frequently see lower [[secondary attack rate]]s [[@somekhRoleChildrenDynamics2020]([[[[EVD]] - 2x lower secondary attack rate for children compared to adults in exhaustive contact tracing study of 13 families in Central Israel - [[@somekhRoleChildrenDynamics2020]]]]), [@jingHouseholdSecondaryAttack2020]([[[[EVD]] - 30 percent lower household secondary attack rate for children vs. adults, ~2x lower than older adults, in Guangzhou - [[@jingHouseholdSecondaryAttack2020]]]]), [@liCharacteristicsHouseholdTransmission2020]([[[[EVD]] - 5x lower secondary attack rate for children compared to adults in households in China - [[@liCharacteristicsHouseholdTransmission2020]]]])].

                - This set is particularly important because the studies also include exhaustive testing of close contacts in addition to some ability to equate for exposure (same household).

    - There is some unevenness in how children are defined, which creates challenges for granular reasoning about age-dependent susceptibility

        - [[@zhangChangesContactPatterns2020]([[[[EVD]] - Model of contact tracing data from Hunan CDC estimates ~30 percent lower risk of infection for children vs. adults - [[@zhangChangesContactPatterns2020]]]])] draws the cutoff at 14 yo.

        - [[@dattnerRoleChildrenSpread2020]([[[[EVD]] - Model of PCR data in Israel adjusted for under-detection of cases find 2x lower prevalence for children vs. adults - [[@dattnerRoleChildrenSpread2020]]]])] draws the cutoff at 19 yo.

        - [[@zhuChildrenAreUnlikely2020]] draws the cutoff at 18yo.

    - Age-dependent susceptibility may not hold for newer variants

        - Most of these studies are from early in the pandemic

            - {{[[TODO]]}} Need to find more recent studies that directly cover periods and regions where new variants are prevalent
