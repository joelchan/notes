        - Abstract

            - I provide novel empirical evidence grounded in an original theoretical framework to explain why [[colocation (matters for the) innovation/collaboration]] rate, direction, and quality of scientific collaboration. To address endogeneity concerns due to selection into colocation and matching, I exploit the constraints imposed on the spatial allocation of labs on the Jussieu campus of Paris by the removal of asbestos from its buildings. Consistent with search costs (of innovation) [[search costs of innovation]] constituting a major friction to collaboration, ^^colocation increases the likelihood of joint research by 3.5 times^^, an effect that is mostly driven by lab pairs that face higher search costs ex ante. Furthermore, separation does not negatively affect collaboration between previously colocated labs. However, while colocated labs grow increasingly similar in topics and literature cited, separated ones embark on less correlated research trajectories. Research outcomes, instead, seem to be mostly influenced by how distance affects execution costs: after colocation, labs are more likely to pursue both lower-quality projects (a selection effect) and high-quality projects (an effort effect). Opposite effects on quality are observed after separation. Whereas search costs affect which scientists are likely to collaborate together, execution costs shape the quality of their output. The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2017.2798. This paper was accepted by Ashish Arora, entrepreneurship and innovation.

                            - The methodology is **generally** likely to be biased: when labs value proximity to other labs they want to collaborate with, there is a [[selection effect of innovation]] that makes an [[endogeneity bias]]

For the case of this paper, there is an [[exogenous variation/change]] in terms of what neighbors a lab is offered

                        The methodology is **generally** likely to be biased: when labs value proximity to other labs they want to collaborate with, there is a [[selection effect of innovation]] that makes an [[endogeneity bias]]

Overall, colocation seems to increase the number of collaborations that will end **on both tails of** the distribution (first and fourth quartiles), and to decrease activity in the third quartile (negative and significant) and potentially in the second quartile (negative but not significant).

One interpretation of this result is that these [[colocation (matters for the) innovation/collaboration]] constitute **arbitrage opportunities** across domains of science, and that if we were able to observe these pairs for substantially longer periods of time, the positive effect on the right tail may revert to the mean. (why? short-term benefit?) (p.4360) 

Another interpretation is that once faced with a more heterogeneous set of local peers, labs were encouraged to embark on higher-risk, higher-reward projects (which would be consistent with the increase in variance).
