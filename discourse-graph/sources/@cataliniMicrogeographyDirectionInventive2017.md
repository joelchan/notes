                                Side note: the data for this figure likely drops all lab pairs where collaboration is never observed, hence the smaller number of observations.

                Claim #8: after [[separated labs  separation]]

                    Lab pairs that usually face high search costs (potentially also because space allocation is generally optimized by discipline) **are not only more responsive to** (sounds that responsive means negatively) changes in the distance (as we have seen in Table 7 ), but are also able to produce higher-impact research **when given the opportunity** (this clause sounds to be hypothetical) to take advantage of lower execution cost (why? meaning low-quality projects?) (p.4360-4361)
