        - Abstract

            - In an experimental study of designing by adaptation, professional and student knitwear designers werev ideotaped designing sweaters basedon a Persian rug or a 19th century tapestry. The designers used a range of source-triggered and goal-directed adapta- tion strategies to create adaptations ranging from the closest possible translations into the medium to radical transformations of abstract characteristics. While each strategy sometimes led to each type of adaptation, the source-triggered strategies were predominant for the easy-to-adapt source (the rug)andtypically led to close adaptations; while the goal-directed strategies were more common for the more difficult source (the tapes- try),andmoreoften led tomoreradicaltransformations of the source. The professional designers made more use of goal-directed strategies than the student design- ers. The study supports the view that creative behavior can usefully be described in terms of consistent patterns resulting from both task demands and from cognitive capacities and learned skills

- [[@eckertAdaptationSourcesInspiration2003]] for [[[[QUE]] - Under what conditions do diverse initial examples lead to better final design solutions?]] | designers used a range of strategies for working with sources of inspiration, ranging from simpler, more source-driven strategies like direct source adaptation, to more complex and reflective strategies like source analysis and schema-driven source selection; professionals were more likely to use the more complex strategies

    - this is not directly related to question of diversity (this wasn't varied), though it is on the diverse end of the spectrum, since the sources of inspiration were from a different, though closely related, domain (rugs) compared to the target task (knitwear)

    - the main relevance for our question is what the designers actually did with the examples: of particular interest is the comparison between the professional and student designers, with an implication that the professionals' strategies are ones we want to support

    - i'm mostly struck by how diverse the strategies were!

    - there was also maybe some [co-evolution]([[[[CLM]] - Design proceeds by co-evolution of problem and solution space]]) going on, but this time driven by source to problem?

    - there were differentiations between more complex, goal-directed strategies, which led to more radical and indirect transformations of the source, and simpler and more direct strategies that led to more straightforward, closer transformations of the source

    - professionals used the complex ones moreso than the students

        - this reminds me very much of [[@ballSpontaneousAnalogisingEngineering2004]]'s findings about "schema-driven" vs. "case-driven" analogizing

    - the more complex strategies also remind me of the [[ðŸ§± conceptual combination]] stuff with far vs. near pairs leading to more advanced things like emergent features

    - there is a core question here for us: how much do we think we can nudge people towards particular strategies without outright telling them, via interface differences? probably the effect is quite small, relative to an expert-novice difference. but i doubt it is zero. i am wondering about an analogy to the [[Preparation for Future Learning]] stuff, where something like an opportunity learn (here, maybe opportunity compare, or see in context) is the difference between being able to successfully transfer learning (here, maybe model and benefit from diversity)

    - quick methods notes

        - task and procedures: design menswear t-sleeve sweater with turtlenecks, with a rug/tapestry as a source of inspiration, while being videotaped and [thinking aloud]([[m/Think-aloud protocols]]) in the lab, for about 30 mins

        - sources: rug, or tapestry. rug is considered closer, more typical source; tapestry a bit more unusual and less obvious for adaptation to knitwear, particularly menswear

    - results

        - tough to summarize, quite holistic, but one thing that is interesting to note is that [[[[EVD]] - designers used a range of strategies for working with sources of inspiration, ranging from simpler, more source-driven strategies like direct source adaptation, to more complex and reflective strategies like source analysis and schema-driven source selection; complex strategies were more likely to be used by professionals and also more associated with radical transformation of sources - [[@eckertAdaptationSourcesInspiration2003]]]]
