        - > ...a place is a space which is __invested with understandings__ of behavioral appropriateness, cultural expectations, and so forth. We are __located__ in "space", but we __act__ in "place". Furthermore, "places" are spaces that are valued. The distinction is rather like that between a "house" and a "home"; a house might keep out the wind and the rain, but a home is where we live. (p. 69)

    - Just won [[Lasting Impact Award]] at [[CSCW]]!

    - Relevant for [[Salma Elsayed-Ali]]'s ideas around [[design worlds]] for [[D/Democratizing Design]]

        - I wonder about reframing from design worlds to specifically theorize about place-making

- lasting impact for [[@harrisonReplaceingSpaceRoles1996a]]

    - [[Michael Zimmer]]: space evokes culture!!!! --> [[design worlds]]

    - [[John Tang]]: how important is synchronicity? can you co-create a powerful shared sense of place in an asynchronous context?

    - [[Luigina Ciolfi]]: it's almost impossible to "reproduce" places because they emerge in such a personal, value-laden way, but we can try to support place-like qualities for people to appropriate, like Steve said

    - note that [[Steve Harrison]] comes from design in *architecture* - v nuanced sense of place and its connection to physical built environment!

        - q from audience member: Broad question: I haven't read the 1996 paper being discussed yet, but curious if there are overlaps in your thinking between these ideas of placemaking and the ideas in the architecture book "The Timeless Way of Building" by Christopher

    - [[Yanni Loukissas]]: This discussion brings to mind the aesthetics of Wabi Sabi and how they demonstrate distinctly different values than contemporary "frictionless" interface design. I wonder how we can make room in HCI to explore alternative aesthetic values and their social implications.

        - [[Sukrit Vekatagiri]]: Also reminds me of seamful design and appropriability, intentionally building in "hooks" and explicitly revealing technical limitations.

    - Kind of makes me think of the idea of epistemic artifacts vs technical artifacts; like, if something is too polished and well defined, it doesn't invite active engagement in the same way

    - I'm really curious about if Steve (and others who have deeply engaged w/ the core ideas of the paper) have been excited by any technological innovations for supporting a (shared) sense of place? Maybe a concrete area to bound the question might be any innovations in remote conferences?

        - [[John Tang]]: Telepresence beam, easier to notice when something is missing. The paper gives us language for noticing this.

        - [[Kori Inkpen]]

            - Hard to define, but "know it when I see it"

            - Two examples

                - John Tang came in as a robot! That was delightful!

                    - Maybe bc there is shared history! Felt like John was in the room again :)

                - https://ohyay.co/

        - [[Michael Zimmer]]: [[sys/gather.town]] - interesting and playful! creating a virtual *place* for us to gather, not just recreating a physical space

            - still struggling with accessibility

                - [[John Tang]]: Accessibility is important, and probably also points out how many of our designs of spaces over-rely on visual sense for creating a sense of place

                    - Sound, touch could also be very compelling factors in creating a sense of place.

        - Ppl here may be interested in the idea of remote presence that this startup is working on: https://emerge.io/

            - still a lot of research to do!

                - how to design for actions in space in digital spaces - what *ought* we to do? not (just) what *can* we do

                - interact *IN*, not just *with*

                - arranging the body!

                - design for social constructs, not technology!

    - One way to distill:

        - A sense of shared space is very helpful for appropriate behavioral framing for collaborative action. A sense of shared space is insufficient for appropriately framing behavior for collaborative action; you also need a shared sense of place, which is not the same as space.

    - How do they make the case for this?

        - Examples from shared intuition:
