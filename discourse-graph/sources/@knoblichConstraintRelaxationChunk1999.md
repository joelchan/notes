        - Abstract

            - Insight problem solving is characterized by impasses, states of mind in which the thinker does not know what to do next. The authors hypothesized that impasses are broken by changing the problem representation, and 2 hypothetical mechanisms for representational change are described: the relaxation of constraints on the solution and the decomposition of perceptual chunks. These 2 mechanisms generate specific predictions about the relative difficulty of individual problems and about differential transfer effects. The predictions were tested in 4 experiments using matchstick arithmetic problems. The results were consistent with the predictions. Representational change is a more powerful explanation for insight than alternative hypotheses, if the hypothesized change processes are specified in detail. Overcoming impasses in insight is a special case of the general need to override the imperatives of past experience in the face of novel conditions.

    - #lit-context

        - [[Stellan Ohlsson]] is prominent authority on [[Insight problem solving]]

        - Design: have people do two blocks: in second block people got a lot btter, so probably best to consider block 1 to really feel out the ffects of problem types

            - Vary problem difficulty by varying constraint hardness and chunk tightness, both together and independently

    - #[[📝 lit-notes]]

        - Two key mechanisms proposed for overcoming [[Impasses]] (aka [[🧱 fixation]], which is diagnosed as a suboptimal [[problem (re)formulation]]): 1) [[constraint relaxation]], and [[chunk decomposition]]

            - If constraints are not considered explicitly, possible to over/under-constrain problem representation (through implicit reminding) (p. 1535)

                - Therefore, if problem solver is able to relax unnecessary constraints, they can find a problem representation that admits solution, and overcome the impasse

            - Argument for [[chunk decomposition]] as a mechanism of breaking [[🧱 fixation]] and [[Impasses]]

                - People create chunks to organize experience.

                - Encountering a novel problem activates some chunks from past experiences. Not all of them will be helpful; and some will be actively unhelpful. And some will need to be decomposed ([[compression]] reversed??)

                - Decomposing is harder for "tighter" chunks: where the components are not (obviously) meaningful units on their own

                - Thus, problems with tight chunks are harder to solve.

            - Evidence for this: [[[[EVD]] - People were ~2x worse at solving matchstick arithmetic problems when the elements were harder to decompose into chunks - [[@knoblichConstraintRelaxationChunk1999]]]] when they made it harder to decompose chunks (even with identical constraint types), people were about half as likely to solve the problem (p. 1540).

                - Said another way

                    - Impeding [[chunk decomposition]] makes it harder to overcome [[Impasses]] during [[Insight problem solving]]

            - What are chunks??

                - "chunks" for Knoblich are *not* similar to [[Design Patterns]] or [[Frames]] - they are more like visual features, that exist at multiple levels of hierarachies. (cf.

                - Knoblich characterizes [[Chunk]]s as #> "patterns that capture recurring constellations of features or components" (p. 1535)

                - To [[@chaseMindEyeChess1973]] on the idea of [[Chunking]] as a mechanism for expert performance #expertise

                    - Which itself goes back fruther to [[de Groot]], back in the mid-1960's

                    - Be careful, though! Their idea of [[Chunking]] is closer to the idea of [[compression]] - packing a huge amount of information into a smaller unit, abstracting away a lot of things.

        - Observed some transfer effects across blocks: once you see a constraint relaxed or decompose a chunk, a later problem that .

            - Somewhat anecdotal in Experiment 1, and directly validated in Experiment 2

[[CLM - Breaking ideas down into component parts facilitates creative reinterpretation]]

- In [[Insight problem solving]], there is the idea of [[chunk decomposition]] (see, e.g., [[@knoblichConstraintRelaxationChunk1999]]). The basic idea goes something like this:

    - People create chunks to organize experience. ((kJ0JodSt_))

    - Encountering a novel problem activates some chunks from past experiences. Not all of them will be helpful; and some will be actively unhelpful. And some will need to be decomposed ([[compression]] reversed??)

    - [Evidence]([[SupportedBy]]) for this comes from experiments where [[chunk decomposition]] was impaired, leading to worse performance on solving the problem (see, e.g.,  [knoblichConstraintRelaxationChunk1999]([[[[EVD]] - People were ~2x worse at solving matchstick arithmetic problems when the elements were harder to decompose into chunks - [[@knoblichConstraintRelaxationChunk1999]]]])).

- Quick #Reflection after working on lit notes for [[@knoblichConstraintRelaxationChunk1999]]

    - Feels almost impossible to trace the [[context]] of a finding through the literature: "^^how does *this finding* fit into the larger literature?^^" is such a central question but SO hard to do under any tooling regime than manual tracing (e.g., on [[sys/Google Scholar]] you can see citations, but they're basically useless once you go up from the low 10s: impossible to trawl through and filter): identify all other papers that cite this paper, and then trawl through their findings to figure out how they compare to the finding you care about. Should actually try this manually as fast as I can to get an estimate on the time cost.

        - [[sys/scite.ai]] and [[sys/Semantic Scholar]] should be able to help with this some. But what if there is relevant work that doesn't cite this work, for whatever reason?

        - If you're lucky, your exact finding has a meta-analysis or systematic review on it. But what is the proportion of meta-analysese to findings we care about? Put another way, for what proportion of our building blocks do we have a decent representation of its context in the literature?
