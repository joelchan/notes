                - and key for that is **access**

                - What are the core components of [[legitimate peripheral participation]]

                    - The most obvious one is having access to do real (but less high-stakes) stuff alongside more core members of the {{alias: [[communities of practice]]

                    - But another one might be stories, since one important way to join language and practice is in stories and [[narrative]]

                    - I am not sure if this is [[legitimate peripheral participation]]

        - Chapter 4

            - knowledge is situated, shouldn't be disembedded from the setting and community

            - talking about a practice from the outside may lead to just learning to "talk the talk", with no actual learning (of the knowledge necessary for practice) taking place; need to "^^[[talk within a practice]]

                - Example: Yucatec midwives learn to use biomedical terms in their talk (when required) from health official training courses, but it doesn't actually change their practice

            - one important way to join language and practice is in stories and [[narrative]]

                - #> "stories...are packages of situated knowledge" (from [[jordan 1989]]

                    - be careful, though! shouldn't separate from practice, don't substitute for [[legitimate peripheral participation]]

                        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FSlf3EO3yxQ.png?alt=media&token=abc58a64-5d7d-49ad-a281-a0831fcf9ffc)

            - some initial thoughts on [[Q How if at all do libraries and small businesses fit into the narrative of communities of practice]]

                - because knowledge is situated, shouldn't be disembedded from the setting and community, the physical and social proximity of each library branch to the physical and social locus of the small business community could be a positional advantage

                - because talking about a practice from the outside may lead to just learning to "talk the talk", with no actual learning (of the knowledge necessary for practice) taking place; need to "^^[[talk within a practice]]

                    - one important way to do this is to curate learning materials and traces that are based around stories, since one important way to join language and practice is in stories and [[narrative]]

                        - probably quite a bit of these are going on in forums already

            - need to have a legitimate post, where you're actually participating. without it, you can't learn!

                - cf. African Americans's relatively lower probability of acquiring specific business human capital through work experience partially explains racial disparities in business outcomes [[@fairlieRaceEntrepreneurialSuccess2008]]
