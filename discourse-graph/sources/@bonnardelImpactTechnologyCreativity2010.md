        - Abstract

            - Technology may be considered as an interface between individuals and the products they create, but we have to determine whether the use of new systems effectively enhance individuals' creative activities. In this paper, we present a new angle of reflection that we illustrate in the field of creative design, since it is a constant challenge for designers to introduce creativity in the projects they work on. The approach we propose is centred on designers' cognitive processes. We argue that both the development of new CAD (computer-aided design) systems and their assessment should be conducted on the basis of a deep understanding of designers' cognitive processes. In accordance with this view, we present three empirical studies that were conducted in order to analyse the impact of new design support systems on designers' cognitive processes. Therefore, the results we present contribute to further our knowledge of whether new CAD technologies effectively facilitate designers' activities and enhance their creativity.

- [[@bonnardelImpactTechnologyCreativity2010]], also per scite, is a possible complication on this, in that they also compared novice and experienced designers, but also varied analogical distance (but actually the finding that scite picks up as disputing is from [[@bonnardelEvocationProcessesNovice2004]])

    - interestingly, they find for the experienced designers that creative performance is highest for somewhat near [analogies]([[analogy]]) (so-called near inter-domain, vs. intradomain or remote inter-domain stimuli), adding to positive support for [[[[CLM]] - There is a 'Sweet Spot' in Analogical Distance. Somewhat far analogies lead to better creative outcomes than very near or very far analogies]]

    - so this line of work is really important regarding [[design-by-analogy]] for [[D/Computational Analogy]]
