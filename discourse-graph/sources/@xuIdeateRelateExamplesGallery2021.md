- Title:: IdeateRelate: An Examples Gallery That Helps Creators Explore Ideas in Relation to Their Own
- Author(s):: [[Xiaotong (Tone) Xu]], [[Rosaleen Xiong]], [[Boyang Wang]], [[David Min]], [[Steven P. Dow]]
- Abstract:: Creating truly original ideas requires extensive knowledge of existing ideas. Navigating prior examples can help people to understand what has already been done and to assess the quality of their own ideas through comparison. The creativity literature has suggested that the conceptual distance between a proposed solution and a potential inspiration can influence one’s thinking. However, less is known about how creators might use data about conceptual distance when exploring a large repository of ideas. To investigate this, we created a novel tool for exploring examples called IdeateRelate that visualizes 600+ COVID-related ideas, organized by their similarity to a new idea. In an experiment that compared the IdeateRelate visualization to a simple list of examples, we found that users in the Viz condition leveraged both semantic and categorical similarity, curated a more similar set of examples, and adopted more language from examples into their iterated ideas (without negatively affecting the overall novelty). We discuss implications for creating adaptive interfaces that provide creative inspiration in response to designers’ ideas throughout an iterative design process. CCS Concepts: • Human-centered computing → Information visualization; Computer supported cooperative work; Interaction design theory, concepts and paradigms.

                - Research questions

                    - 1) How do creators leverage a visualization of conceptual distance to explore examples compared to a list?

                    - 2) How do people curate examples to help them improve their own ideas differently when using a visualization versus a list of ideas?

                - Study

                    - An online experiment (N=45 participants) to evaluate the benefits and tradeoffs of the IdeateRelate system (Viz condition) compared to a simple list view (No-Viz condition).

                    - As a study procedure, participants first generated their own idea for solving a COVID-related challenge. Then participants explored all 637 ideas — either using IdeateRelate (Viz condition) or a list view (No-Viz condition) — and curated at least seven ideas to help them refine their own proposals. Finally, participants generated a final concept while viewing the curated subset of examples.

                        - Curating a list includes [[view]], [[analyze]] and [[compare]]?

                    - Measure of similarity

                    - How did they know whether/how people adopted langaug from examples?

                - Results

                    - Viz participants tended to explore examples more similar to their own whereas No-Viz participants explored more randomly.

                    - Instances of [[combine & integrate]] and [[model]] functional outcomes

                        - Users' ideas first; examples with low diversity (similar to users' ideas) might help [[combine & integrate]]; examples with high diversity (far from users' ideas) might help [[model]]

                        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F71_ykYO85h.png?alt=media&token=7c2fccd3-99c5-49f0-a990-7a6576f7003e)

                    - Viz participants leveraged both category and semantic distance data, in different ways, to hone in on primarily similar examples.

                        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FSccfOsbMtu.png?alt=media&token=03488ec0-70c6-445e-bd1b-ce3d36c21c65)

                    - Viz participants also adopted more language from the examples they curated.

                        - [[contextualize]] could help [[combine & integrate]] similar examples which is one level lower

                        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F49BxUOijF4.png?alt=media&token=33ebfa81-0f4d-40f6-9e49-4ad8d3759d60)

                    - However, this increased influence of the examples did not mean users simply emulated them; we found no negative effect on the overall novelty.

                - __block ref in major methods details from the source methods / context block we might need later to make sense of this result, particularly as they might conflict with others. __

            - __also discuss possible critiques/claims. create source CLM notes for author conclusions (if you like), or reference other CLMs that we have that engage with this__

        - __Also can discuss meta-results (combinations of results) in a similar template.____

    - ## side notes

        - __Where are the authors coming from? Are there any useful "breadcrumbs" (e.g., other theoretical frameworks, authors, papers) we can follow up on?__

- Q: I wonder whether the term "contextualize" cannot represent visualizing examples or ideas. For example, [[@xuIdeateRelateExamplesGallery2021]] is to visualize the conceptual distance between a proposed solution and a potential inspiration, but is that "contextualizing" examples?

    - ^^Joel:^^ name is not set in stone yet, still developing

        - v useful to do this with examples of interfaces

        - viz could be contextualizing or other, depending on the details!

            - e.g., visualizing attribtues of a single example might be analysis, comparing and contrasting multiple examples in terms of dimensions that you can modify, is probably closer to contextualizing (whatever we end up calling it)
