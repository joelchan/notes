            - Abstract

                - Scientific innovation depends on finding, integrating, and re-using the products of

                - previous research. Here we explore how recent developments in Web technology,

                - particularly those related to the publication of data and metadata, might assist that

                - process by providing semantic enhancements to journal articles within the mainstream

                - process of scholarly journal publishing. We exemplify this by describing semantic

                - enhancements we have made to a recent biomedical research article taken from

                - PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases, providing enrichment to its

                - content and increased access to datasets within it. These semantic enhancements

                - include provision of live DOIs and hyperlinks; semantic markup of textual terms, with

                - links to relevant third-party information resources; interactive figures; a

                - re-orderable reference list; a document summary containing a study summary, a tag

                - cloud, and a citation analysis; and two novel types of semantic enrichment: the

                - first, a Supporting Claims Tooltip to permit “Citations in

                - Context”, and the second, Tag Trees that bring together semantically

                - related terms. In addition, we have published downloadable spreadsheets containing

                - data from within tables and figures, have enriched these with provenance information,

                - and have demonstrated various types of data fusion (mashups) with results from other

                - research articles and with Google Maps. We have also published machine-readable RDF

                - metadata both about the article and about the references it cites, for which we

                - developed a Citation Typing Ontology, CiTO (http://purl.org/net/cito/). The

                - enhanced article, which is available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0000228.x001, presents a

                - compelling existence proof of the possibilities of semantic publication. We hope the

                - showcase of examples and ideas it contains, described in this paper, will excite the

                - imaginations of researchers and publishers, stimulating them to explore the

                - possibilities of semantic publishing for their own research articles, and thereby

                - break down present barriers to the discovery and re-use of information within

                - traditional modes of scholarly communication.
