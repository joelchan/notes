- Title:: Levels of success in the use of the literature in a doctorate
- Author(s):: [[A Holbrook]]
- Abstract:: This article explores two themes, the first is what examiners look for when judging a doctoral thesis or dissertation, the second is what constitutes an acceptable ‚Äòlevel‚Äô of doctoral scholarship. The focus of the analysis will be the literature review, chosen because it is in the presentation and use of the literature that scholarliness will be evident. The article draws together for the first time the findings of two large independent research studies on the doctorate that took place around the same time, one in the USA, the other in Australia. The aim of both studies was to make the expectations for the dissertation more transparent to graduate students. What academics expect of the literature component of the dissertation is examined in relation to ‚Äòcoverage‚Äô and ‚Äòuse‚Äô. The findings indicate that examiners have more modest expectations of a thesis than those generally implied in the notion of academic scholarship.

        - Abstract

            - This article explores two themes, the first is what examiners look for when judging a doctoral thesis or dissertation, the second is what constitutes an acceptable ‚Äòlevel‚Äô of doctoral scholarship. The focus of the analysis will be the literature review, chosen because it is in the presentation and use of the literature that scholarliness will be evident. The article draws together for the first time the findings of two large independent research studies on the doctorate that took place around the same time, one in the USA, the other in Australia. The aim of both studies was to make the expectations for the dissertation more transparent to graduate students. What academics expect of the literature component of the dissertation is examined in relation to ‚Äòcoverage‚Äô and ‚Äòuse‚Äô. The findings indicate that examiners have more modest expectations of a thesis than those generally implied in the notion of academic scholarship.

[[Lecture Notes - INST 888 - Synthesis]]

- [[@holbrookLevelsSuccessUse2008]] (the assigned reading) reviews examiner comments on appropriate use of the literature, which maps to my understanding of [[synthesis]]. We can look at the comments on both the "acceptable" and outstanding sides of dissertations to glean some insight into our "target" level of synthesis. Consider especially the comments relating to the criteria of "working understanding" and "critical appraisal" (two of four key criteria for good use of literature)

    - Side note: I am interested in and concerned by the fact that ((#Claim Many dissertations are deemed acceptable by examiners despite comments that clearly indicate an unsatisfactory level of [[synthesis]], by scholarly standards (p. 1028-1032)))

- ### How can I develop "disciplinary embeddedness" [[@holbrookLevelsSuccessUse2008]] as an interdisciplinary researcher?

    - Maybe one way to think about it is sanity-checking that the way you're drawing on an idea or method from somewhere else would be recognized as not doing violence to that idea/method by someone who is an expert in it. I'm not 100% sure though.
[[888 Lecture Notes Week 11 Synthesis Practical Tips]]

- ### Critical appraisal [[@holbrookLevelsSuccessUse2008]] is CRITICAL

    - This is how we get a good [[problem (re)formulation]]: we don't need to do our study if we know "enough".

        - cf. our discussions of problematization

        - Another angle I haven't yet talked as much about is the [connection to Blooms' taxonomy]([[Bloom's taxonomy]] is also relevant, describing how synthesis is at the top of a pyramid of how we assimilate knowledge for use. ), with synthesis on top of criticism.

            - Along these lines, might be helpful also to look at a [rubric for scoring literature reviews](Developed a rubric for scoring literature reviews, including a category for [[synthesis]]) developed by [[@booteScholarsResearchersCentrality2005]], which prominently features critical appraisal in the high points of their rubric, similar to [[@holbrookLevelsSuccessUse2008]]

    - Although you don't have to do this in a "mean" or dismissive way (often that signals to me that there is a lack of depth in the synthesis: we are standing on the shoulders of giants, after all, not simply dismissing *everything* that's come before)

        - cf. See, for example Granello [[@granelloPromotingCognitiveComplexity2001]] who explicitly map the stages of synthesis to [[Bloom's taxonomy]]
[[May 7th, 2020]]

- often see a lack of critical appraisal, insight, and discussion of heterogeneity, in submitted manuscripts (contra [[@strikeTypesSynthesisTheir1983]] Three intellectual standards for (good) synthesis (p356 onwards), and the [importance (and lack of) of critical appraisal](((-WYQv2Cnn))) laid out in [[@holbrookLevelsSuccessUse2008]])

[[CLM - Synthesis is creating a new whole out of component parts]]

- Classic undifferentiated list, as noted in #[[@holbrookLevelsSuccessUse2008]] and others.

    - So, idea of "parts, not whole"? Assemblage? Can't transcend the sum of the parts. Or might not even have the sum.

    - The idea of a conceptually new whole construction is in contrast with what we often see in related work sections and literature reviews, which are much more about assemblage, often listing in chronological or author-order, what things have been done, what topics have been covered, with little to no synthesis into a coherent new whole.

        - #Thought-Fragment Additionally, the [[IVEO Matrix]] isn't quite where we want it to be yet: it's more of a meta-analysis or [[systematic review]], rather than a coherent new whole. There is no causal model or graph that ties it all together to support sophisticated reasoning and decision-making

        - In this vein, [[systematic review]]s can be construed as a narrow subset of [[synthesis]] (and literature reviewing)

            - It's not just that they're more easily done in well-structured domains where we have a bit more agreement.

            - It's also that these [[systematic review]]s and meta-analyses are often laser-focused on just one edge in a causal model!

                - Granted, good reviews (especially [[m/meta-analysis]]) might try to estimate some of the variability, but they're rarely focused on explicating a causal model or larger whole.

                    - Especially in medicine (e.g., [[Cochrane systematic reviews]]), the goal is more about getting a really good handle on what the evidence can say about a very narrowly defined question.
