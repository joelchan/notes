    - lots of connections

        - is a nice example of [[Examples of analogy driving innovation]] - analogy between "strong programme" in sociology of scientific knowledge, and embodied cognitive science

        - also connects to [[Salma Elsayed-Ali]]'s [[idea - designing in place]] stuff: here it's expounding on the meaning of **situatedness** - the situation, according to Dewey, is "a complex, qualitative contextual whole that is constituted by transactions between organism and environment and that enables and constrains experience in particular ways"
