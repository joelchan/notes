        - Abstract

            - Experts generally solve problems in their fields more effectively than novices because their well- structured, easily activated knowledge allows for efficient search of a solution space. But what hap- pens when a problem requires a broad search for a solution? One concern is that subjects with a large amount of domain knowledge may actually be at a disadvantage, because their knowledge may con- fine them to an area of the search space in which the solution does not reside. In other words, domain knowledge may act as a mental set, promoting fixation in creative problem-solving attempts. Aseries of three experiments in which an adapted version of Mednick's (1962) remote associates task was used demonstrates conditions under which domain knowledge may inhibit creative problem solving.
