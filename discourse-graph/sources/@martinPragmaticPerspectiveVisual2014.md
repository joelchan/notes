- Title:: A pragmatic perspective on visual representation and creative thinking
- Author(s):: [[Lee Martin]], [[Daniel L. Schwartz]]
- Abstract:: This paper offers a cognitive analysis of how visual representations can increase the chances of creativity, while also considering the ways in which they might hinder it. Specifically, it presents four cognitive mechanisms of creativity supported by visualisation: reinterpretation, abstraction, combination and mapping. Each process is described, analysed for potential benefits and pitfalls, and illustrated with examples. Although none of these processes guarantees creativity, together they can increase the odds of a creative moment. The paper concludes with a discussion of how to best prepare people to make use of visuals to support creative thought.
