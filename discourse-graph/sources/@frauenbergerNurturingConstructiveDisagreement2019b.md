        - Abstract

            - Participatory design (PD) with heterogeneous groups poses particular challenges, requiring spaces in which different agendas or visions can be negotiated. In this paper we report on our PD work with two groups of neurodiverse children to design technologies that support co-located, social play. The heterogeneity in the groups in terms of abilities, conceptions of play, motivations to be involved and individual preferences has challenged us to think of the design process and its outcomes as spaces for continuous negotiation. Drawing on the notion of agonistic PD, we sought not to necessarily reconcile all views, but foster constructive disagreement as a resource for and possible outcome of design. Using our project work as a case study, we report on controversies, big and small, and how they manifested themselves in the processes and outcomes. Reflecting on our experiences, we discuss possible implications on the notion of democratising technology innovation.

    - key idea of [[Agonistic Participatory Design]]

    - There is a key idea of conflicts being particularly in danger of being very unproductive (leading to children disengaging) with this particular population

        - and some ways of dealing with it

            - mixing ideas

            - familiar objects (vs. using researchers' materials)

            - an [[Agonistic Participatory Design]] approach (robust enough to get value even under situations where the conflict seemed especially unproductive)

    - but not all can be dealt with
