[[QUE - Under what conditions is it possible to transfer expertise from one person to another]]

- from [[@ackermanSharingExpertiseKnowledge2003]]

    - people may be resistant to knowledge from outside their speciality (cc [[[[QUE]] - How might domain distance modulate the effects of analogies on creative output?]])

            - Employee were resistant to transfer knowledge that require adaption from original context to a new context within a consumer products organization

            - Managers were reluctant to seek knowledge from other plant, arguing that they are not relevant to their operations in truck assembly plants.

        - [[@laveSituatedLearningLegitimate1991]]

            - It is embedded in a context (place, people, situation)

            - Knowledge is embedded so it is difficult to extract.

        - [[@singleyTransferCognitiveSkill1989]]

            - Knowledge transfer will be greater if the tasks are more similar.

            - There can be negative transfer when the context of the tasks does not match.

                - Citation statements from the book

                    - Experts' lists less specific steps than novice.

                    - Experts oversimplified the steps and methods (abstracting the tasks) in order to process information rapidly and view task holistically.

                    - This make it harder to transfer knowledge

                    - Case Study/Experiment

            - This probably has implications for how we elicit the knowledge to add to our wiki - how do we create the conditions where they can be specific?

                - Citation statements from the book

                    - Experiment about completing an electronic circuits

                    - Expert provide more simplified and abstract (less concrete) instructions to the novices than those with less expertise.

                    - Novices often perform better with instruction from those with less expertise.

                - Expert often underestimate novice performance times. (They think novice perform faster than they do)

                - Expert have difficulty recalling their ability when they were novice. (They have difficulty recalling how little they knew as novice)

                - They attempt to anchor their previous performance and other performance based on their current expert performance. They would adjust down from this anchor to predict novices.

                - Because of inaccurate memories of their own novice performance, they often overestimate their ability as novice.

                - Availability bias and Anchoring

                - Expert vs Novice in electronic repair.

                - Expert tends to view the electronic devices as a system of components and follow abstract conceptual model of the way the device work. (more abstract and conceptual)

                - Novice tends to use trail-and-error procedure and see see the device as unrelated parts.

                - Experts uses more abstract idiosyncratic language than those with less expertise when explaining to others.

                - This might not be published

            - [[@camererCurseKnowledgeEconomic1989]]

                - Student estimating company earnings

                - Student were not able to ignore their current knowledge when making the estimates.

                - The knowledge of the company biases these student to their own knowledge hence having a harder time trying to guess prediction of uninformed subjects.

                - The curse of knowledge make it difficult for expertise to bridge with novice because "they have difÔ¨Åculty imagining ever having been so ill-informed on the topic and accurately imagining the information that novices might not know."

                - Feedback does not change the expert (student with knowledge about the company) estimate of company earnings and they were anchor to their original knowledge.

                - Anchoring

                - Experts vs Novice in Programming Tasks

                - expert uses more conceptually based representation (abstract)

                - novice uses syntactically based representations (concrete)

            - Case Study of making pizza was not in this paper, despite being cited. We tracked it down to [[@darrAcquisitionTransferDepreciation1995]], but even here it's not actually a result, but a contrived example

                - Harder to share how to hand-toss a pizza (tacit) than to share the cook time of different pizza (explicit)

                - Experts usually only tell part of the story (explicit part) about task that require tacit knowledge (hand-tossing a pizza)
