        - Abstract

            - To enable better representations of biomedical argumentation over collections of research papers, we propose a model and a lightweight ontology to represent interpersonal, discourse-based, data-driven reasoning. This model is applied to a collection of scientific documents, to show how it can be applied in practice. We present three biomedical applications for this work, and suggest connections with other, existing, ontologies and reasoning tools. Specifically, this model offers a lightweight way to connect nanopublication-like formal representations to scientific papers written in natural language.

        - taxonomy/hierarchy of evidence / certainty, ranging from 0 (lack of knoweldge) to 3 (complete certainty, accepted), mapped to common phrasings in natural language, like "not known", "suggest that"
