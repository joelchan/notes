        - Abstract

            - Writing introductory help requests is a key part of develop-ing new professional connections, such as through email and other online messaging systems. This paper presents the design and an experimental evaluation of IntroAssist-a web-based tool that leverages cognitive apprenticeship in-structional methods to support writing introductory help requests through an expert-informed checklist, tagged peer examples, self-tagging, and suggested word limit. In a study of IntroAssist with novice entrepreneurs, we find that 1) expert raters consider help requests written with the tool as more effective, 2) participants are able to perform introduc-tory help seeking skills after the tool is removed, and 3) participants report being more likely to send help requests written with the tool. We present implications for the de-velopment of systems that support the initiation of profes-sional relationships.

- A subtle variation of a "find collaborators" model might be a variation on Julie Hui's [[sys/IntroAssist]] [[@huiIntroAssistToolSupport2018]]

    - Where might we test something like this? In ConservationX????

    - What would we need to get started?

        - Would be easiest with academic work, can leverage citation network.

        - Just specify papers you've written, or ones you know really well, and those define your "network position"

        - Then whenever we find analogical matches that overlap with your network position, we suggest an intro between you and the seeker
