- Title:: Human resources: Empirical modeling of household and family decisions
- Author(s):: [[John Strauss]], [[Duncan Thomas]]
- Abstract:: This chapter reviews recent advances in the empirical literature on the role that households and families play in investing in human resources. It describes the estimation of reduced form demands for human capital, particularly education and health. Special attention is paid to the measurement and interpretation of the impact of household resources, particularly parental education, income, and impact of community resources, namely—prices and infrastructure. The process underlying the production of human capital is discussed. The chapter also discusses the difficulties in measuring inputs and input quality, and associated issues of estimation and interpretation. The chapter focuses on evidence regarding the influence of family background, school quality, ability, and self-selection. Models of household behavior in a dynamic setting are reviewed. The chapter discusses extensions to the model that is concerned with the flow and allocation of resources across and within households as well as to extensions that treat household boundaries as fluid.

- [[@straussHumanResourcesEmpirical1995]], which was hailed by Esther Duflo as a powerful synthesis that helped her find the right questions for her (ultimately Nobel-prize-winning) work:

    - > When I was in my second year in the Ph.D. program, John Strauss and Duncan Thomas started to circulate, in manuscript form, their review chapter on human resources economics for the Handbook of Development Economics. This is a masterful survey of the literature on health, education, labor markets, and household behavior in development economics until about 1993. To a student trained in labor economics by Joshua Angrist and Stephen Pishke and in development economics by Abhijit Banerjee and Michael Kremer, it made two things very apparent: **the questions could not be more important, and the answers were mostly unsatisfactory. Strauss and Thomas were very explicit about the limitations of the papers they were covering, but they had to deal with the material that was there.**

    - > For example, there were many papers regressing various outcomes (wages, fertility, children’s health) on people’s education. But while the literature in labor was full of attempts to correct for an “ability bias” that did not seem really present in rich countries, there was not a single paper doing this convincingly in the development literature, although the selection of who gets to go to school could, prima facie, be expected to be more severe in developing countries. There were very interesting papers showing that men and women seemed to be spending resources differently, but women who had more resources in their control were likely to live in different families, and this was not really dealt with.

    - > This was fabulous; there seemed to be a whole field open in front of me. I just had to work my way through Strauss and Thomas’s review and identify important questions where it was possible to productively apply the methods I had just learned in labor economics (natural experiments, instrumental variables, etc.) to imrove the answer. There was a lot of work to do, but it all seemed rather manageable: this was my “one page a day” agenda.
