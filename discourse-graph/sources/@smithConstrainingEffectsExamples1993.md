        - Abstract

            - In three experiments we tested the conformity hypothesis–that subjects' ideas would conform to examples they had been shown–by using a creative generation paradigm in which subjects imagined and sketched new exemplars of experimenter-defined categories. Designs made by subjects who had first seen three examples of ideas were compared with those of control subjects, who received no examples. In all three experiments, the ^^designs of subjects who had seen the examples were more likely to contain features of the examples^^. This [[conformity effect]]
