    - Proposed a 2 x 2 between relational and attribute similarity, to understand how analogies relate to other kinds of similarity

        - 2 (relational: low vs. high) x 2 (attributes: low vs. high) model of similarity:

        - Basically, for them, analogy is when you have high relational similarity, but low attribute similarity

        - They call the situation where there is high relational *and* attribute similarity "literal similarity"

            - I agree with this, in that the extreme case of overlap on *all* relational and attribute features = literal similarity. But there is a continuum between them on the "high relational similarity" axis where we'll find near vs. far analogies

[[QUE - What is analogy]]

- [[@gentnerStructureMappingAnalogy1997]] distinguishes [[Analogy]] from similarity and metaphor - key idea is that it is based on similarity in terms of *relations*, in spite of or instead of attribute/feature (dis)similarities
