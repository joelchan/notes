    - Proposed a 2 x 2 between relational and attribute similarity, to understand how analogies relate to other kinds of similarity

        - 2 (relational: low vs. high) x 2 (attributes: low vs. high) model of similarity:

        - Basically, for them, analogy is when you have high relational similarity, but low attribute similarity

        - They call the situation where there is high relational *and* attribute similarity "literal similarity"

            - I agree with this, in that the extreme case of overlap on *all* relational and attribute features = literal similarity. But there is a continuum between them on the "high relational similarity" axis where we'll find near vs. far analogies
