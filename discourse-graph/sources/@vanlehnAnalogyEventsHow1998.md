        - Abstract

            - In attempting to fit a model of analogical problem solving to protocol data of students solving physics problems, several unexpected observations were made. Analogies between examples and exercises (a form of case-based rea- soning) consisted of two distinct types of events. During an initialization event, the solver retrieved an example, set up a mapping between it and the prob- lem, and decided whether the example was useful. During a transfer event, the solver inferred something about the problems solution. Many different types of initialization and transfer events were observed. Poor solvers tended to fol- low the example verbatim, copying each solution line over to the problem. Good solvers tried to solve the problem themselves, but referred to the exam- ple when they got stuck, or wanted to check a step, or wanted to avoid a detailed calculation. Rather than learn from analogies, both Good and Poor solvers tended to repeat analogies at subsequent similar situations. A revised version of the model is proposed (but not yet implemented) that appears to be consistent with all the findings observed in this and other studies of the same subjects. I.
