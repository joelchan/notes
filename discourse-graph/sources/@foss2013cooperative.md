    - Some Context:

        - [[Greg Walsh]] (at least) has a strong continuity with the original [[KidsTeam]] work, from which the [[Cooperative Inquiry]] approach arose
- #lit-context

    - Researchers partnered with a private school for kids with learning disabilities. The 12 [participants]( ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FFTLzi4K0Sw.png?alt=media&token=cf0e32e0-739e-4603-9a06-a84067f706b7) pg 37) were age 11 and their disabilities were a combination of ASD, ADHD, and anxiety disorders.

Researchers conducted a total of eight one hour sessions. 1 was an introduction session 6 were design sessions and the final session was a reflective session

    - Researchers used qualitative research methods to analyze data and look for emerging themes being that they were not looking for any specific themes.
