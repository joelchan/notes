        - Abstract

            - Well functioning Markets for Technology (MFT) allow inventors to sell their inventions to others that may exploit them better. Indirectly, MFT also enhance welfare by supporting a division of labor between upstream inventors and downstream commercializers. In this paper we explore the relationship between science and MFT and argue that inventions based in science should be more tradable. Science increases the eﬃciency of inventive activity, and increases the value of the resulting inventions. In addition, science reduces the transfer cost of knowledge. Conceptualizing inventions in scientiﬁc terms improves communication between buyers and sellers, reduces search costs for buyers, and enhances buyers’ ability to evaluate and integrate the invention. Using large scale data, we establish a positive relationship between science and MFT. We show that this relationship is stronger for novel inventions (inventions that are more diﬀerent from existing inventions), consistent with science reducing search and integration costs. To isolate the eﬀect of science on the demand for technology acquisition, we exploit a quasi-natural experiment of the arrival of Soviet scientists to American cities. Holding ﬁxed invention quality, an increase in the ex-post scientiﬁc understanding of an invention leads to a 22% higher likelihood that it is traded.
