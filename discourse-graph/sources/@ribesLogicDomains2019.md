        - Abstract

            - The [[logic of domains]] has become a key organizing principle for contemporary computing projects and in broader science policy. The logic parses collectives of expertise into ‘domains’ that are to be studied or engaged in order to inform computational advancements and/or interventions on the domains themselves. The concept of a domain is set against a proposition that there is a more general, domain independent or agnostic technique that can serve to intermediate the domains. This article contrasts instances of this discourse, organizing and techne, drawing from cases in artificial intelligence, software engineering, and science policy to illustrate three ongoing figurations of the logic as i) experimental research, ii) formalization in method and software tools, and iii) a de facto organizing principle for science policy and technology development.

            - The task at hand, then, was to scour the world for ‘all of our knowledge’ and represent it within computable formalisms. Or, cast programmatically: ‘How are observations to be used to get knowledge about the world, and how are the other kinds of knowledge to be obtained?’ and ‘In what kind of internal notation is the system’s knowledge to be expressed?’ ([McCarthy and Hayes, 1981 \[1969\]](#)). These two questions – how to acquire knowledge from domains, and how to represent that knowledge in a computable formalism – become central challenge questions for the logic of domains thereafter.

            - Always accompanying commitments about the content of a domain was the question of how to ‘acquire’ or ‘elicit’ that knowledge, along with how to ‘represent’ or ‘capture’ it. Representing knowledge in a computable form requires forms of media for doing so; and so, in these years of AI we can observe the creation of a series of competing formalisms for computable knowledge representation ([Poirier, 2018](#)). In this milieu, formulations of what matters in a domain (almost invariably, problems and the knowledge to solve them), coevolved with techniques for acquisition and media for representation.

            - , [Davis et al. (1977)](#) reflect extensively about the limitations of their acquisition process. For instance:

            - a fundamental assumption is that the expert teaching the system can be ‘debriefed’, thus transferring his knowledge to the program. That is, presented with any conclusion he makes during a consultation, the expert must be able to state a rule indicating all relevant premises for that conclusion. The rule must, in and of itself, represent a valid chunk of clinical knowledge. (p. 40)

            - These are indeed rather vast assumptions, and, as we noted above, they become the topic of an expanding literature and methodological repertoire focused on knowledge acquisition and representation, as well as the grist for critiques of the entire expert system research program (c.f., [Collins, 1990](#); [Forsythe and Buchanan, 1989](#); [Schank and Jona, 1994](#)).

            - A notable difference from what we have seen before lies in what domains are ‘made of.’ In domain analysis, the object of interest is less ‘knowledge’ and more the ‘activities’ and ‘objects’ in a domain. A second difference is a more capacious understanding of expertise. AI researchers had focused largely (though not exclusively) on scientific contexts, but with domain analysis in software engineering, expertise is a property of business (e.g. a travel agent), or really any group using software.

            - But what most sets domain analysis apart from what we have seen before is the focus on developing a routine, repeatable method for inquiring upon and representing the domains

            - In the broader trajectory of the logic of domains, boundary-spanning figures such as the craftsman are a commonly proffered solution to the problem of transcending the specificity of domains. By various names, such figures populate each of the manifestations recounted in this article.

            - Apprehensions about the interpretability of formalisms or representations, and recurrent boundary-spanning characters, both speak to the concern that representing domains is epistemically challenging, and that evaluating representations is itself doubly technical, i.e. domains are often esoteric, and in a completely different way, representations of domains too are esoteric.

            - The irreductionist end of the spectrum is more nebulous, but is recurrently expressed as the possibility that domains may have logics of their own (such as ‘judgmental reasoning’) or the consideration that distinct methods and formalisms may be required for particular domains (e.g. as with domain analysis above). [Star (1989)](#) perhaps most clearly articulates the irreductionist position in an explicit critique of Simon’s classic paper:

            - Instead of a search for a logical Esperanto, … we should search for an analysis of objects. Problem-solving … produces workable solutions that are not, in Simon’s terms, well-structured. Rather, they are ill-structured: they are inconsistent, ambiguous, and often illogical. Yet, they are functional and serve to solve many tough problems. (p. 51)

            - Rather than positing a singular base formalism or procedure across the domains (a ‘logical Esperanto’), the tertium quid, which #[[@starInstitutionalEcologyTranslations1989]] calls a [[[[PTN]] - boundary object]], is: ‘abstracted from all domains, and may be fairly vague. However, it is adaptable to a local site precisely because it is fairly vague; it serves as a means of communicating and cooperating symbolically’ (p. 49). This formulation sustains key features of the logic of domains: There are domains, they are specific and heterogenous and yet it is possible to translate or connect across these. But, as [Star (1989)](#) asserts, ‘unlike Turing’s universal computer, the creation of boundary objects both respects local contingencies and allows for cross-site translation’ (p. 51).

            - Representationalist approaches appear to suggest that computational models can stand in for, even replace, domain expertise. Expertise appears as something to be extracted or automated, ‘stretching whatever discourse they find upon the ontological grid that is provided by their particular design methodology’ ([Agre, 2004](#): 8). In such a model the expert is ultimately disposable, and the specificity of the domain is something to be overcome. Contemporary manifestations of this pole include arguments such as that big data analytics or machine learning will dispense with the need for (domain) theory altogether (c.f. [Anderson, 2008](#); [Slezak, 1989](#)). In contrast, irreductionist approaches tend to take a realist stance to the heterogeneity of expertise, knowledge, or domains more broadly; in some form they tend to recognize that, say, infectious medicine may require epistemologies and methods distinct from those for, say, understanding geologists, or travel agents. Irreductionist figurations of the logic speak to a desire for approaches to heterogeneity (of knowledge, expertise, methods or data) that do not resort to overcoming difference by reducing it to a single underlying logic or decompositional heuristic.

- This paper seems extremely important and foundational for the lab. From [[David Ribes]] and [[Geoffrey C Bowker]] [[@ribesLogicDomains2019]]

    - Speaks to key tensions across [[D/Synthesis Infrastructure]], as well as some foundational assumptions in [[D/Computational Analogy]] - that we can somehow usefully extract the "key features" of domains to connect people and ideas from different "domains".

        - Clearly people do this when they do [[interdisciplinarity]].

        - But whether/how this can be computationally mediated should be carefully considered.

        - Part of this is the deep tension about the degree to which [[[[CLM]] - Knowledge is fundamentally contextual]]
