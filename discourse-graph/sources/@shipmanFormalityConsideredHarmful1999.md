        - Four problems with / created by formalization: 1) cognitive overhead, 2) tacit knowledge, 3) premature structure, and 4) situational structure

            - Cognitive overhead (aka [[Cognitive Load]]

            - [[tacit knowledge]]

            - [[Enforcing Premature Structure]]

            - [[Situational Structure]]

        - [[PTN - incremental formalization]]

            - Basic idea: (mostly) informal entry of information, then defer formalization until later in the task when it is useful

            - Key advantages:

                - Reduce initial overhead of entering information

                - Reduce risk of harm from prematurely committing to the "wrong" structure

            - Examples of incremental formalization

                - In the [[sysHyper-Object Substrate (HOS) system]]

                - Infoscope is a news reader system that suggests filters based on users' reading patterns; this helps them make their goals explicit which can facilitate formalization after it emerges from their task behaviors (p. 347-348)

                - VIKI is a spatial hypertext system that includes heuristic algorithms to find recurring visual/spatial patterns in layout of objects; users can use these to specify schemas if they wish
