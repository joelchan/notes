        - Abstract

            - Literature-based discovery systems aim at discovering valuable latent connections

                - between previously disparate research areas. This is achieved by analyzing the

                - contents of their respective literatures with the help of various intelligent

                - computational techniques. In this paper, we review the progress of

                - literature-based discovery research, focusing on understanding their technical

                - features and evaluating their performance. The present literature-based

                - discovery techniques can be divided into two general approaches: the traditional

                - approach and the emerging approach. The traditional approach, which dominate the

                - current research landscape, comprises mainly of techniques that rely on

                - utilizing lexical statistics, knowledge-based and visualization methods in order

                - to address literature-based discovery problems. On the other hand, we have also

                - observed the births of new trends and unprecedented paradigm shifts among the

                - recently emerging literature-based discovery approach. These trends are likely

                - to shape the future trajectory of the next generation literature-based discovery

                - systems.
