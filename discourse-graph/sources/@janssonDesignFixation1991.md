        - some weirdness in authorship here: the data was collected as part of a master's thesis, but the student isn't an author?

        - experiment 1

            - participants: 25 senior mechE students at Texas A&M

            - task: design a car-mounted bicycle rack that is easy to mount (both rack and bike), doesn't damage bike or car, and versatile across cars and bikes. everyone was given an hour, and asked to construct as many designs as possible, comment and number the designs

            - design: between-subjects (12 in control, 13 in "fixation"). participants in "fixation" group were shown two views of an example design that was partially flawed in terms of ease of mounting (flaw was also described!)

                - NOTE: no information here on how the designs were coded: IME, not always obvious whether or not a design has a feature. Would like to see some more details on this.

        - experiment 2

            - participants: 31 students in senior level MechE design course

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FJHF20Gta1D.png?alt=media&token=3c7ffd20-3d3a-4bae-9982-f305d468d2e0) (p. 6)

            - task: design a volume-measuring apparatus for cooking for blind people: should be easy to operate for blind, work for powders and liquids, prevent waste, move from 1/4 to 2 cups, not splatter, easy to clean, and cheap. framed as idea generation task, given 45 mins

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F_-HOEkx9i8.png?alt=media&token=e7fe4704-668e-4dae-a8ab-d2fb18d29acc) (p. 6)

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2Fk2S6G4sU6B.png?alt=media&token=90ca376e-23ad-4894-99ff-592ffd65710a) (p. 6)

            - design: between-subjects (15 in control, 16 in fixation): fixation group showed a flawed example (again), but in this case, the flaw isn't pointed out (that not versatile enough, and no overflow device, so it will splatter)

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FM5MBzWrNY-.png?alt=media&token=0ec626e4-b91b-489c-ac67-7f0d70638812) (p. 6)

            - measures: total num. designs, as well as prop. with features from example design (namely, not infinitely variable, no overflow device, very similar to example design)

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FR3Xits8Nl2.png?alt=media&token=b7b0bce4-7510-44f8-9a38-e38c3068eee0)  (p. 6)

                - hmmmm this one is even more sketchy than experiment 1: the last "feature" is super subjective AND binary! getting a bit nervous here. also not obvious what is meant by "not infinitely variable" (guessing it means that there is only increments of 1/4 cups?)

        - experiment 3

            - participants: 35 seniors in mechE design course at Texas A&M

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2Fr_t376gWzt.png?alt=media&token=fbc4caa7-6922-43e7-b2aa-42dd6c90b4d4) (p. 8)

            - task: design a disposable, spill-proof coffee cup (should also be operable by one hand, durable, and have no straws or mouthpieces)

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F2_Bnm7TpWz.png?alt=media&token=a3607717-94d3-40de-9afe-d620778ce422) (p. 8)

            - design: between-subject (17 in control, 18 in fixation): fixation group showed a flawed example (but flaw not pointed out: had straw and mouthpiece, and would leak)

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FTuOWpJKHN0.png?alt=media&token=a174b9fb-3713-476b-8c95-9d1b8ccf4074)

            - measures: number of designs, plus feature transfer (would leak, has straws, has mouthpieces), and also flexibility (number of different approaches / total num designs), and originality (how many of their ideas were not similar to other participants' ideas)

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FYoCUr5OyJC.png?alt=media&token=49fb248b-41c9-4e45-abab-e018ba6b87f4) (p. 8)

                - errr again here i'm getting nervous about the measure: what counts as "similar" (flexibility and originality quite suspect here)? especially bc it's binary again here. and assessment of will leak isn't binary either (or at least shouldn't be: has mouthpice is ok i guess).

        - experiment 4

            - participants: 13 professional structural design engineers in a major corporation in Forth Worth, TX

            - task: design an apparatus to take samples and measure speed and pressure at different points along the intestinal track: should be max. 3/8" diameter, can measure speed + pressure + sample contents at 20+ points along entire intestinal tract, can locate measurements and samples, and minimize discomfort to patient

            - design: between-subjects (7 in control, 8 in fixation): fixation group shown an example design with flaws (not explicitly stated) around discomfort

        - [Across]([Senior mechanical engineering students](((L9Pert3wW))) who [were shown an example](((wifdfiVqs))) (flawed, with flaws stated) design for a bike rack were approximately 2X more likely to [include key features from the example design](((EhzLUIP8e))) in [their own brainstormed designs](((I6nlnuhu7))), compared to students who didn't see the example; both sets of students generated similar numbers of total design ideas) [three](((JQTZ6O5dx))) [experiments](((piMY5G8cZ))), undergrad design students who were shown an example design were about 2X more likely to include features from that design in their own ideas, even though the design was flawed (and in one case, explicitly pointed out as a flaw), compared to students who didn't see an example. Basically [the same pattern](((qHXeIGhad))) was found with professional engineers.
