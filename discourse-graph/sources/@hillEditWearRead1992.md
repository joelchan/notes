        - Abstract

            - We describe two applications that illustrate the idea of [[computational wear]] in the domain of document processing. By graphically depicting the history of author and reader interactions with documents, these applications offer otherwise unavailable information to guide work. We discuss how their design accords with a theory of professional work and an informational physics perspective on interface design.

    - #[[üìù lit-notes]]

        - strikes me as a really interesting #example-of [[[[PTN]] - Organize by using]], and to a fuzzier extent (through alignment of incentives between you doing something and you creating some computationally useful trace) [[[[PTN]] - Prefer to accrete new infrastructures on top of existing ones]]

        - the instantiation of the idea looks familiar today (ca. [[July 14th, 2020]]), in things like github commit logs

        - also spawned downstream work on [[[[PTN]] - Integrated crowdsourcing]]
