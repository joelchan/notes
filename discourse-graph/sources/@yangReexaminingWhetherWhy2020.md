    - very focused on UX

    - interesting: traditional methods are more about designers working with teh constraint of communicating with the engineer or technical person - they only have to understand at a minimal level to communicate and understand the range of capabilities the engineer specifies

        - they don't have to know the technology as a design material so intimately

    - so she's proposing a new / different approach that enables more of a [[Reflective Conversation with the Design Material]]

    - many statements lack citations to systematic studies

    - question about the maturity of the technology

        - ML is becoming more mainstream

        - the more that happens, the more understanding the general public (and by extension, designers) will get

        - hard part is communicating that

    - skeptical that ML is really that different from other tech like cassette tapes, walkmans, boom box

    - waht designers need to know: the affordances of the tech - what it can *do*

    - her ideas about depth of knowledge are quite different from wei-wei's - less deep

    - interesting part for [[Wei-Wei Chi]]: lowering the barrier is not enough

        - e.g., interactive systems like [[sys/TensorFlow Playground]] that let people paly with the system, have some idea of why this works and visually why this works, even if they don't know the math

            - sufficient for high level sketch of understanding the broad sketches of the ML process

        - analogy to [[Arduino]] --> also lowers the barrier, but has a higher ceiling

            - bc there is an abstraction over the annoying stuff, but you can still open up

            - by contrast, [[sys/TensorFlow Playground]] removes access to /  abstracts away entirely the ability to go deeper and change say the input data

            - weka

    - difference between
