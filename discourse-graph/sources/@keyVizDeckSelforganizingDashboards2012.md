        - Abstract

            - We present VizDeck, a web-based tool for exploratory visual analytics of unorganized relational data. Motivated by collaborations with domain scientists who search for complex patterns in hundreds of data sources simultaneously, VizDeck automatically recommends appropriate visualizations based on the statistical properties of the data and adopts a card game metaphor to help organize the recommended visualizations into interactive visual dashboard applications in seconds with zero programming. The demonstration allows users to derive, share, and permanently store their own dashboard from hundreds of real science datasets using a production system deployed at the University of Washington.
