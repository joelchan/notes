- Title:: The Intellectual Challenge of CSCW: The Gap Between Social Requirements and Technical Feasibility
- Author(s):: [[Mark S. Ackerman]]
- Abstract:: Over the last 10 years, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) has identified a base set of findings. These findings are taken almost as assumptions within the field. In summary, they argue that human activity is highly flexible, nuanced, and contextualized and that computational entities such as information sharing, roles, and social norms need to be similarly flexible, nuanced, and contextualized. However, current systems cannot fully support the social world uncovered by these findings. In this article I argue that there is an inherent gap between the social requirements of CSCW and its technical mechanisms. The social-technical gap is the divide between what we know we must support socially and what we can support technically. Exploring, understanding, and hopefully ameliorating this social-technical gap is the central challenge for CSCW as a field and one of the central problems for human-computer interaction. Indeed, merely attesting the continued centrality of this gap could be one of the important intellectual contributions of CSCW. I also argue that the challenge of the social-technical gap creates an opportunity to refocus CSCW.

    - core concept of the [[social-technical gap]]: "the great divide between what we know we must support socially and what we can support technically" (p. 180)

    - throughout this piece i am mentally translating "social activity" for "sensemaking" or "creative knowledge work" or "synthesis" - e.g., "{social activity | synthesis work} is fluid and nuanced, and this makes systems technically difficult to construct properly and often awkward to use" (p. 181)

        - this is the analogy that applies to our setting

            - just realized that this is actually an #example-of [[analogy]] here!

        - and some i haven't seen as much

        - this one is striking: "exceptions are normal in work processes"

    - love the example of P3P: people need v nuanced and negotiated ways to manage the "privacy" of their personal information: this is a v difficult thing to reconcile with design goal of automating privacy!

    - highlighted example of [[@greenbergRealTimeGroupware1994]] dealing with "concurrency control" and explicitly fleshing out an important **disanalogy** between distributed systems and groupware

    - in section 3, he's basically trying to argue that this [[social-technical gap]] is a fundamental limit that will endure

        - (shades of speed of light? and [limits of prediction]([[[[CLM]] - Prediction in complex social systems is fundamentally limited]])?

            - the latter point here might be related to why [[[[CLM]] - Paths to creative breakthroughs are frequently oblique]], and it's really really hard to judge creative ideas! [[[[QUE]] - Is it possible to measure creativity in a scientifically precise way? If so, how?]]

    - arguably, [[CSCW]]'s big gains came from [[Ethnomethodology]] and related "constructionist" approaches that cut through abstract modeling of social behavior to reveal the details of its complexity

    - what does Ackerman mean by "a science"?

    - for [this hard claim](in section 3, he's basically trying to argue that this [[social-technical gap]] is a fundamental limit that will endure) about it being "fundamental", really curious about more comparative work that shows whether/how these limits are not present, or have been successfully overcome. the heart of the argument is 4.1 and 4.2, but these seem.... weak to me? idk, arguing for a hard fundamental limit is really really hard... it's shades of an impossibility claim, which seems to demand for v logical things, rather than empirical alone?

        - cc [[[[EVD]] - assuming that there is a polynomial-time procedure for choosing solutions for an intractable function implies that P=NP - [[@vanrooijIntractabilityUseHeuristics2012]]]]

        - or [[Godel's incompleteness theorem]]

        - I think he doesn't quite succeed for me at establishing this claim, but articulating and synthesizing decades of CSCW work into a concept of the [[social-technical gap]] is really valuable!
