- Abstract:: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused a rapid shift to full-time remote work for many information workers. Viewing this shift as a natural experiment in which some workers were already working remotely before the pandemic enables us to separate the effects of firm-wide remote work from other pandemic-related confounding factors. Here, we use rich data on the emails, calendars, instant messages, video/audio calls and workweek hours of 61,182 US Microsoft employees over the first six months of 2020 to estimate the causal effects of firm-wide remote work on collaboration and communication. Our results show that firm-wide remote work caused the collaboration network of workers to become more static and siloed, with fewer bridges between disparate parts. Furthermore, there was a decrease in synchronous communication and an increase in asynchronous communication. Together, these effects may make it harder for employees to acquire and share new information across the network.

- This light review + discussion of the latest Microsoft study on [[remote work]] [[@yangEffectsRemoteWork2021]] is a nice paired contrast with the possible future of synthesis that [[Matt Clancy]] is trailblazing:  Offices Are Useful for Soft Work, Not Hard Work - The Atlantic: https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/09/offices-microsoft-study-out-group-connections/620137/ (h/t [this tweet](https://twitter.com/DKThomp/status/1440284115274645521))

    - Compare with Matt's living review at [[New Things Under the Sun]], with links to updated in-depth discussions of literature: Remote Work and the Future of Innovation ¬∑ New Things Under the Sun: https://www.newthingsunderthesun.com/pub/z91hacem/release/2

    - Relevant of course to [[[[QUE]] - What are the most efficient routes to useful cross-boundary knowledge?]]

    - But it doesn't give us what we need to explore that design space. Matt's living [[synthesis]] does.

    - I do appreciate Derek's conclusion about opening up the design space between office vs. remote.
