        - Abstract

            - This paper describes the process of attaining the insight required to solve a particular problemthe Mutilated Checkerboard (MC) problem. It shows that ^^attaining insight requires discovering an effective problem representation, and that performance on insight problems can be predicted from the availability of generators and constraints in the search for such a representation^^. To test these claims we varied the salience of features leading to the critical concept of parity in the MC problem. Using chronometric measures, verbal protocols, and computer simulations, we explored first why it is difficult to find a representation for the Checkerboard problem, and then tested four potential sources of search constraint for reducing the difficulty: cue salience manipulations, prior knowledge, hints, and heuristics. While subjects used each of these four sources of constraint, a particular heuristic---noticing properties of the situation that remained invariant during solution attempts (the Notice Invariants heuristic)---proved to be a particularly powerful means for focusing search. In conjunction with hints and independently, it played a major part in producing the insight that yielded an effective problem representation and solution.

    - #lit-context

        - bread and butter experiment

            - Participants: 25 CMU undergrads in intro psych, with no prior experience with problem

            - Design: varied the type of board they were working with, from blank to colored, to color-named (black and pink), to bread and butter on each square. the idea was to vary the salience of parity (or the lack thereof) between the types of squares

            - Procedure: given board, allowed to draw on it, and given hints at four intervals: 1) tell them the solution is that it's impossible, and you need to prove it, 2) tell them the proof is easier if you abandon exhaustive search as a thing (this and previous given at the same time at 15 mins in if Ss still trying covering solutions), 3) tell them to attend to the colors/words (~15 mins after first two hints), and lastly 4) tell them to count the number of each type of square (if they hadn't solved it in 40 mins)

        - for [[[[THE]] - interaction-oriented theory of creative inspiration from examples]]

            - in what sense might the stimulus of the different boards be similar to examples?

            - what is an example for the MC problem?

                - the object is to either show how 31 dominoes can cover the remaining 62 squares on an 8x8 checkerboard, where two diagonally opposite corners have been removed

                - so i think an example is a board + domino placement?

                - and the principle underneath is the... heuristic?

                - solving the problem requires recognizing that parity has been violated because the corners are both the same color

            - the key insight from here that is relevant is the idea of cues that guide the generation of alternative problem spaces. i think this is one mechanism by which examples can enable (re)modeling

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FkHMzqyWaRz.png?alt=media&token=47ddf8b4-c94f-474e-99fb-c351371262f2) (p. 381)

            - they make a key connection back to [[@maierReasoningHumansII1931]]'s two-string problem, and how the accidental brushing of the string by an experimenter could trigger the requisite reformulation of the problem. i think it's an example in the sense of being a concrete (albeit) partial instantiation of a move

                - this now reminds me of the theory of [[[[THE]] - Opportunistic Assimilation Theory]], though i will have to dig into this a bit more deeply.

            - key results

                - [[[[EVD]] - after noticing a key element of a problem representation for the mutilated checkerboard problem (namely the lack of parity between the sequares on teh checkerboard), solutions to the problem came almost immediately after - [[@kaplanSearchInsight1990]]]]

                - [[[[EVD]] - Representing a mutilated checkerboard in a way that made perceptual features of squares more salient facilitated problem reformulation and insight - [[@kaplanSearchInsight1990]]]]

                - a SOAR-based model solved the problem pretty quickly after being given a hint to represent parity in the problem representation

                - the bit about search for representations being the difficulty, not "working out" and searching within the problem space, is also pointed to in Wason & Johnson-Laird 1972 (i wonder if this is the... card logic problem?)

                - there's also some notes in here about how a strategy of noticing many perceptual features was a key distinguishing characteristic of successful subjects, independent o fhte baord manipulation. this is an [[Expertise]] thing

        - {{[[DONE]]}} finish up kaplan. there's really neat stuff in the protocol analysis on the noticing invariants heuristic, which kind of gets at our theory's purpose: some folks were just better at noticing parity, but changing the problem representation physically helped move people along who might not have gottent here by themselves

            - touchstone is [figure 6](Figure 6
![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F_O11j2AgQ7.png?alt=media&token=fbbd7522-7d47-480b-8ce4-89a95775956e) (p. 408))

    - what i'm thinking about the theory rn

        - this part of the theory is the least empirically clean

            - i wonder if this is because... a lot of this stuff happens over long time scales, and isn't easy to study in an experiment

            - this might explain why i'm more likely to notice this in an expensive protocol study, or interviews or ethnographies

        - there's also the connection to the [[co-evolution of problem and solution space]] and [[Reflection-in-Action]] stuff that is... sort of non-obvious on first consideration, but upon deeper refelction actually suggests a sensible and insightful connection

            - this lit is all about how desigenrs reflect on *their own* moves.

            - but if their moves are concrete, and examples are concrete, then it stands to reason that simlar mechanisms may be at play

            - i mean, the reformulation that the insight problem solving folks observe in their various problems resemble this idea of "i make a move, i notice something else new about the problem and hcange it somehow"

        - but this alos feels really rich, like ther's something interesting and new here, beyond your "basic" conceptual combination - this isn't legos or even blending/cooking, it's.. something more.

            - and you're also constrained in what kinds of moves you can generate.

            - but being able to analyze the examples and moves of others, and juxtapose against your own problem, and sort of play out what that does to your problem space, that... feels like it could be really powerful and scalable (sort of like simulations!), and i suspect that is in fact what many top-level designers are doing, albeit in a variety of ways, some just in their heads

            - the reason i feel this is significant, is.. moves are expensive. your own moves. it's rate-limiting.

            - there's a question of whether this reformulation stuff is best triggered by abstract heuristics and principles, and. ..i don't think it's the case. i think there's eomthign about mapping between and attending to concrete cues that is really helpful and facilitates actual transf.er ther'es context in there.

[[October 19th, 2021]]

- One interesting result on this: [[[[EVD]] - Representing a mutilated checkerboard in a way that made perceptual features of squares more salient facilitated problem reformulation and insight - [[@kaplanSearchInsight1990]]]]

    - This suggests that modifying the capacity to make comparisons can have an important impact on model-building/modification, which can have an impact on insight (to the extent that insight is necessary)

        - This means we need to make sure there are multiple local optima in the space: i.e., that the problem space is one where diverse examples should help
