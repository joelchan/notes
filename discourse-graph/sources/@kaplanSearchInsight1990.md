        - Abstract

            - This paper describes the process of attaining the insight required to solve a particular problemthe Mutilated Checkerboard (MC) problem. It shows that ^^attaining insight requires discovering an effective problem representation, and that performance on insight problems can be predicted from the availability of generators and constraints in the search for such a representation^^. To test these claims we varied the salience of features leading to the critical concept of parity in the MC problem. Using chronometric measures, verbal protocols, and computer simulations, we explored first why it is difficult to find a representation for the Checkerboard problem, and then tested four potential sources of search constraint for reducing the difficulty: cue salience manipulations, prior knowledge, hints, and heuristics. While subjects used each of these four sources of constraint, a particular heuristic---noticing properties of the situation that remained invariant during solution attempts (the Notice Invariants heuristic)---proved to be a particularly powerful means for focusing search. In conjunction with hints and independently, it played a major part in producing the insight that yielded an effective problem representation and solution.

        - bread and butter experiment

            - Participants: 25 CMU undergrads in intro psych, with no prior experience with problem

            - Design: varied the type of board they were working with, from blank to colored, to color-named (black and pink), to bread and butter on each square. the idea was to vary the salience of parity (or the lack thereof) between the types of squares

            - Procedure: given board, allowed to draw on it, and given hints at four intervals: 1) tell them the solution is that it's impossible, and you need to prove it, 2) tell them the proof is easier if you abandon exhaustive search as a thing (this and previous given at the same time at 15 mins in if Ss still trying covering solutions), 3) tell them to attend to the colors/words (~15 mins after first two hints), and lastly 4) tell them to count the number of each type of square (if they hadn't solved it in 40 mins)

        - for [[THE - interaction-oriented theory of creative inspiration from examples]]

            - in what sense might the stimulus of the different boards be similar to examples?

            - what is an example for the MC problem?

                - the object is to either show how 31 dominoes can cover the remaining 62 squares on an 8x8 checkerboard, where two diagonally opposite corners have been removed

                - so i think an example is a board + domino placement?

                - and the principle underneath is the... heuristic?

                - solving the problem requires recognizing that parity has been violated because the corners are both the same color

            - the key insight from here that is relevant is the idea of cues that guide the generation of alternative problem spaces. i think this is one mechanism by which examples can enable (re)modeling

            - they make a key connection back to [[@maierReasoningHumansII1931]]

                - this now reminds me of the theory of [[THE - Opportunistic Assimilation Theory]]

            - key results

                - a SOAR-based model solved the problem pretty quickly after being given a hint to represent parity in the problem representation

                - the bit about search for representations being the difficulty, not "working out" and searching within the problem space, is also pointed to in Wason & Johnson-Laird 1972 (i wonder if this is the... card logic problem?)

                - there's also some notes in here about how a strategy of noticing many perceptual features was a key distinguishing characteristic of successful subjects, independent o fhte baord manipulation. this is an [[Expertise]]
