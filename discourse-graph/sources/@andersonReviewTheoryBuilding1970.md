    - FWIW, the first criticism, that it isn't as closely tied to mathematization and formalization as the reviewer would like, is to me a bit of a strength!

- A central insight from the philosophy and practice of science is that a priori theorizing with minimal to no reference to data is not a viable path to deep conceptual progress; such theorizing would stall as "armchair speculation" [[@andersonReviewTheoryBuilding1970]].

    - The importance of data for theory can be seen in how recent advances from the "empirical turn" in economics ([[@backhouseAgeAppliedEconomist2017]]) has invigorated the field as it moved from an almost exclusive emphasis on clean logical mathematical models to an emphasis on empirically testing theories against data.
