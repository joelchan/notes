- Title:: Mixing ideas: a new technique for working with young children as design partners
- Author(s):: [[Mona Leigh Guha]], [[Allison Druin]], [[Gene Chipman]], [[Jerry Alan Fails]], [[Sante Simms]], [[Allison Farber]]
- Abstract:: This paper sets forth a new technique for working with young children as design partners. Mixing ideas is presented as an additional Cooperative Inquiry design technique used to foster effective collaboration with young children (ages 4-6). The method emerged from our work with children on the Classroom of the Future project at the University of Maryland. A case study of this work is presented along with the implications of this method for future research.

- [[idea: CollageCollab]] is like [[sys/Mixing Ideas]] from [[@guhaMixingIdeasNew2004]]

    - details of interactions with other design worlds probably really matters!

        - framing as collage is part of it. here we go further than [[sys/Mixing Ideas]]

        - but also: be careful about framing it as "upload a collection of stuff from your world", or "draw from this collection of stuff from someone else".

            - or run afoul of needed dynamics of [[reuse]] (see [this thread]([[reuse]] feels like the wrong framing. or.. unproductive at least. something is off. there is an implicit assumption that i can literally use the component, like a circuit board piece, or a gear. but knowledge isn't like that. i don't think. cc [[[[EXP]] - [[D/Synthesis Infrastructure]] - Field study for discourse graph extension]]), for example)

            - could trigger unhelpful frames.

        - supporting more than "view" or "compare" might be necessary for this deeper level of integration and processing and engagement.

            - entry point: [[[[CLM]] - examples can improve creative outcomes by enabling more robust (re)modeling of the problem space]]
