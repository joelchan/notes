        - Typical [[scholarly communication]] infrastructures cannot answer the most basic questions that scholars often want to ask

            - e.g.,

                - "What are unsolved problems in domain X? What solutions have been proposed for problem X? What extensions have been proposed? What theories incorporate concept X? What are alternative interpretations of concept X"?
