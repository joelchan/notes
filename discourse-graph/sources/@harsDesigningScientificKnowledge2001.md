        - Typical [[scholarly communication]] infrastructures cannot answer the most basic questions that scholars often want to ask

            - e.g.,

                - "What are unsolved problems in domain X? What solutions have been proposed for problem X? What extensions have been proposed? What theories incorporate concept X? What are alternative interpretations of concept X"?

                    - (p.64)

                    - #Atomicity

        - Theories are a core building block of a model of scientific knowledge (p. 69-70) #Atomicity #compositionality

    - I think [[@ribaupierreExtractingDiscourseElements2017]] has some other examples as well

        - Scientists were rarely (on average, about 1/3 of the time at most) interested in reading the whole paper; instead they are interested in specific elements, such as a finding, a method, a hypothesis, or a definition (p.5) #Atomicity

- Last bit: Augment with [[discourse]] model [[@harsDesigningScientificKnowledge2001]]

    - what are the units?

    - in base model, we have evidence, schemas, etc. - a bit intelligence analysis specific

    - what's the equivalent for?

    - an obvious thing is to have papers as the base units

    - but is that right? (spoiler alert: no!!!!)

        - Selection criteria for epistemology texts: 1) broad and comprehensive, and 2) had an impact on practice of research. But I don't see how this selection criteria is borne out in the selected texts, except maybe [[@popperLogicScientificDiscovery1959]]; no evidence is provided to support the claim that these selected texts meet the stated criteria. So I'm going to put a big asterisk on this until I can confirm it with other stuff. The good thing is that the core statement about statements does sort of pass the smell test, by being consistent with other lines of evidence.

            - [[Mario Bunge]] sort of passes the smell test by having some presence on the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] (across [105 documents](https://plato.stanford.edu/search/searcher.py?query=mario+bunge) related to philosophy of science). That doesn't address the second criteria though, although perhaps only in a loose way.
