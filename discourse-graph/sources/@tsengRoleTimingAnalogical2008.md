        - Abstract

            - An experiment was conducted to gain an understanding of how people assimilate and apply newly acquired information when ideating solutions to a design problem by studying how the nature of problem-relevant information and timing of when it is given can affect idea generation in an open-ended design problem. More specifically, the effects of presenting surface similar information before design conceptualization, or surface dissimilar information before and during design conceptualization on the quantity, breadth, and novelty of solutions generated were analyzed. The effects of open goals, fixation, and priming, as well as their implications in design problem solving are examined. Itwasfound that information that is more distantly related to the design problem impacted idea generation more when there was an open goal to solve the problem, while information that is more obviously similar to the problem impacted idea generation more than distantly related information when seen before problem solving has begun. Evidence of induced design fixation and priming were also observed.

- Reflections for [[bet/[[D/Synthesis Infrastructure]]: it is possible to write close to prose but seamlessly translate to queryable, shareable discourse graph formalisms in the backend]] while encapsulating evidence notes [here]([[@tsengRoleTimingAnalogical2008]] for [[[[QUE]] - How might domain distance modulate the effects of analogies on creative output?]] | near analogies suprisingly novel; quant/diversity benefit for far analogies (curated) only when encountered with open goal (not before)) for [[@tsengRoleTimingAnalogical2008]]

    - Feeling nervousness about not being able to more clearly signal the level of "goodness" of a piece of evidence.

        - Even saying that X and Y are different entails some kind of acceptance of the basic result: if the stats are weird or suspect, for sure you want to say that the evidence is really weak for whatever claim they're trying to make; but, it could be deeper than that: we may not even want to accept that X and Y are different *in the experiment*?

            - Here, already some lossy compression is happening: I'm saying more ideas, instead of higher *average* (arithmetic mean: is the mean appropriate here?) of ideas. I'm thinking of the difference between something very formal like what we saw in the [[Meta-Data Enhanced Study Reports Group]]

        - But there is a definite tension between this and the formality and onerousness of the task. If we lower the formality we risk raising the level of lossiness to where the marginal gain of refactoring notes like this might not be sig. more than just having scratch notes on the paper level or in memory

        - Synthesis downstream, especially if there are opposing effects or inconsistencies, should trigger a reversal of the compression, but... what if there aren't? What if the effects are relatively consistent?

        - In a way, I think I'm maybe just experiencing the anxiety of [[[[CL]] - Predicting trajectories of future reuse of information objects is hard]], which maybe gets inflamed when you look at the items and are actually thinking about [[reuse]]

    - Also, the process feels heavy. To be very honest. Maybe especially for this paper because the results were kind of... messy? And that is probably going to be fairly common, I think.

        - But it's hard to sort out how much of this is just intrinsic load of really trying to make sense of the results (which the format forces)

        - OTOH, my guess is that [[James Heathers]] et al would just... disregard this paper altogether once they hit a few of these snags (all pairwise comparisons, super small N, no adjustments for multiple comparisons, etc.). and that's... probably ok? hard to tell if there's a cost to this, hidden or otherwise.

        - A big question to sort out here then: something like a "dose-response curve" or cost-benefit analysis: at realistic levels of variation in quality, do we still see gains over a paper-centric or other approach to notetaking (like a spreadsheet)?

        - Something that helps me feel a bit better is thinking about [[Raul Pacheco-Vega]]'s stuff, which feels quite effortful also. It's thorough. And meticulous.

        - Dependent measures:

            - Total number of designs

            - Number of functional repeats (a variant way of measuring [[🧱 fixation]] or [[diversity]] (reverse))

            - Number of functionally distinct designs (a variant way of measuring (reverse) [[🧱 fixation]] or [[diversity]] )

            - Novelty of each solution

            - All functional measures relied on a functional categorization, which had two researchers independently assign one or more functional categories (from a bottom-up generated list of 16 categories) to each solution. NOTE: singular solutions (functional categories that only one person generated) were lumped together into a single "other" category, comprising 3% of solutions. [[inter-rater reliability]] was pretty good, at [[Cohen's K]] = 0.87

    - # appraisal

        - the way the devices were described makes me wonder how they compare to encountering these devices in the wild, vs. "curated" to facilitate noticing of the analogical mapping, like in [[@gickSchemaInductionAnalogical1983]] and [[@reedRoleAnalogyTransfer1974]]

            - cf. [[[[QUE]] - What factors control whether people appropriately benefit from analogies (especially far-field ones) during creative problem solving?]] and [[[[CLM]] - People are more likely to benefit from analogies if they encounter/process them with an active goal or license to use them for inspiration]]

        - overall, this isn't a very strong set of results. proceed with extreme caution on their own.

    - # results:

[[January 18th, 2021]]

- This reminds me of the timing stuff: [[@tsengRoleTimingAnalogical2008]], and [[@siangliulueProvidingTimelyExamples2015]], among others:

    - Under what starting conditions would people even be motivated to try to process analogies?

        - That's the first ingredient, I think

        - If this isn't present, then it's possible no amount of design of the matching or interaction will really help

    - in [[@laneEngineeringSerendipityWhen]], the motivator is applying for grants

    - keep this motivation in mind
