            - Abstract

                - Incubation often plays a role in creative problem solving. Theories of analogical problem solv- ing and Opportunistic Assimilation (OA) theory (Seifert, Meyer, Davidson, Patalano,&Yaniv, 1995) of incubation in creative problem solving were tested.OA theory predicts that a previously encoded unsolved problem will be spontaneously accessed and mapped by a later encounter with an analogous prob- lem-with-solution. This study tested theOA predictions on insight problems and found spontaneous access ef- fects for uninformed participants. Spontaneous access was compared to a baseline derived fromthe same par- ticipants typical problem-solving behavior following distracter tasks. Following access of the analogous cue, participants increased their performance, demon- strating incubation effects. These results support the theory that at least some incubation effects are caused by previously unsolved problems being solved on later chance encounters with relevant information in the en- vironment.
