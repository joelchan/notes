        - Abstract

            - The pursuit of truth in research should be both an ideal in aspiration and also a reality in practice. The PORTAL-DOORS Project (PDP) strives to promote creative authenticity, fair citation, and adherence to integrity and ethics in scholarly research publishing using the FAIR family of quantitative metrics with acronym FAIR for the phrases Fair Attribution to Indexed Reports and Fair Acknowledgment of Information Records, and the DREAM principles with acronym DREAM for the phrase Discoverable Data with Reproducible Results for Equivalent Entities with Accessible Attributes and Manageable Metadata. This report presents ^^formalized definitions for idea-laundering plagiarism by authors, idea-bleaching censorship by editors, and proposed assertion claims for authors, reviewers, editors, and publishers in ethical peer-reviewed publishing^^ to support integrity in research. All of these principles have been ^^implemented in version 2 of the PDP-DREAM ontology written in OWL 2^^. This PDP-DREAM ontology will serve as the model foundation for development of a software-guided workflow process intended to manage the ethical peer-reviewed publishing of web-enabled open access journals operated online with PDP software.

    - Seems like [[Carl Taswell]] is interested in tracing ideas through the literature as well. Wonder if their [ontology]([[ontologies]]) have any connection to what we're doing?

        - Can think of how our micropubs could make it easier to trace the kinds of [[plagiarism]] and [[censorship]] that might be going on...

    - focusing on the problem of plagiarism

    - intriguing related work from this group on [[standards]] for measuring the degree to which a given article appropriately cites prior work - could maybe help quantify some sense that [[[[CLM]] - Effective synthesis is rare]]?
