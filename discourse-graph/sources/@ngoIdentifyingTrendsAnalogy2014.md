        - Abstract

            - Design-by-analogy, including bio-inspired design, is a powerful tool for innovation and engineers need better tools to enhance ideation. To support these efforts, a cross-sectional empirical product study of 70 analogy-inspired products is conducted to investigate factors involved in the analogy-inspired design process. Products are randomly sampled from three technology magazines and a bioinspired design database. Seven variables are developed and used to classify each example according to design team composition, analogy mapping approach, analogies used, and design outcomes. Results suggest that problem-driven approaches, which start from a design problem and find solutions in analogous domains, produce analogy-inspired products as effectively as knowledge-driven approaches, which begin with knowledge in an analog domain and find design problems to solve. A common outcome of analogy-inspired design appears to be improved product performance, supporting the use of analogies for improving existing technologies. Few associations were detected between design outcome variables and other variables, precluding recommendations for how to compose design teams, what approaches to take, and what number and source of analogies to use in order to achieve the outcomes measured in this study. For instance, results show that problem-driven and knowledge-driven approaches yield improved product performance at statistically indistinguishable rates, such that neither approach is advantageous over the other for increasing performance.
