        - Abstract

            - [[systematic review]]s answer specific questions based on primary literature. However, [[systematic review]]s on the same topic frequently disagree, yet there are no approaches for understanding why at a glance. Our goal is to provide a visual summary that could be useful to researchers, policy makers, and health care professionals in understanding why health controversies persist in the expert literature over time. We present a case study of a single controversy in public health, around the question: ‚ÄúIs reducing dietary salt beneficial at a population level?‚Äù We define and visualize three new constructs: the overall¬†__evidence base__, which consists of the evidence summarized by [[systematic review]]s (the¬†__inclusion network__) and the unused evidence (__isolated nodes)__. Our network visualization shows at a glance what evidence has been synthesized by each [[systematic review]]. Visualizing the temporal evolution of the network captures two key moments when new scientific opinions emerged, both associated with a turn to new sets of evidence that had little to no overlap with previously reviewed evidence. Limited overlap between the evidence reviewed was also found for [[systematic review]]s published in the same year. Future work will focus on understanding the reasons for limited overlap and automating this methodology for medical literature databases.

            - different [[systematic review]]s between 2002 and 2014 came to very different conclusions on dietary salt

            - [[systematic review]]s that came to different conclusions also frequently relied on very different (types of) evidence

- #example-of [[[[CLM]] - Contextualizability is necessary for synthesis]]: [[@hsiaoVisualizingEvidencebasedDisagreement2020]] different [[systematic review]]s between 2002 and 2014 came to very different conclusions on dietary salt

    - the main thing i wonder is how much of this #context (the nature of evdience that was draw on) is salient in the review, also to teh extent that prior reviews are referenced!
