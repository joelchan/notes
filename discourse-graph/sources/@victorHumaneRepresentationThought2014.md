        - Abstract:

        - New representations of thought — written language, mathematical notation, information graphics, etc — have been responsible for some of the most significant leaps in the progress of civilization, by expanding humanity’s collectively-thinkable territory.

        - But at debilitating cost. These representations, having been invented for static media such as paper, tap into a small subset of human capabilities and neglect the rest. Knowledge work means sitting at a desk, interpreting and manipulating symbols. The human body is reduced to an eye staring at tiny rectangles and fingers on a pen or keyboard.

        - Like any severely unbalanced way of living, this is crippling to mind and body. But it is also enormously wasteful of the vast human potential. Human beings naturally have many powerful modes of thinking and understanding. Most are incompatible with static media. In a culture that has contorted itself around the limitations of marks on paper, these modes are undeveloped, unrecognized, or scorned.

        - We are now seeing the start of a dynamic medium. To a large extent, people today are using this medium merely to emulate and extend static representations from the era of paper, and to further constrain the ways in which the human body can interact with external representations of thought.

        - But the dynamic medium offers the opportunity to deliberately invent a humane and empowering form of knowledge work. We can design dynamic representations which draw on the entire range of human capabilities — all senses, all forms of movement, all forms of understanding — instead of straining a few and atrophying the rest.

        - This talk suggests how each of the human activities in which thought is externalized (conversing, presenting, reading, writing, etc) can be redesigned around such representations.

- Analog media are also still currently eminently more *embodied* - see [[Bret Victor]]'s rant about how our predominant interaction paradigms fall far short of engaging the full richness of interaction with our HANDS (and bodies) [[@victorHumaneRepresentationThought2014]]

    - Generally, these discussions make me think of [[Bret Victor]]'s work on [[dynamic media]] and [[DynamicLand]] (see, e.g., [[@victorHumaneRepresentationThought2014]])

            - --> war rooms

        - Want to be able to think with the body and in space

            - Shared space fo rthinking

        - SB: Watched [[Bret Victor]] video after our call URL: https://vimeo.com/115154289

            - So much YES on the humane work thing. This is what sparked my interest in that tiltbrush, but i'd forgotten! I draw a lot and it's so hard on my body to sit hunched over with a pen. I had this idea that drawing in space would be much more enjoyable (not to mention healthier). The whole VR part is a downside for me as I don't like the idea of leaving reality. So, BV's ideas on dynamic computing, while I can't really imagine how it would work, is intriguing!

            - Also a quote from URL: https://vimeo.com/115154289

[[December 1st, 2019]]

- Was watching this inspiring talk on "Humane Representations for Thought" [[@victorHumaneRepresentationThought2014]] (background on the talk in [[R: victorNoteHumaneRepresentation2014]]) by [[Bret Victor]]: https://vimeo.com/115154289 - somewhat relevant to our [[D/Synthesis Infrastructure]] in that it thinks about [[representation]] and how that makes things more or less thinkable

    - Some inspiring examples of representations / media that made new kinds of thinking possible, such as the data plot, or Leibniz's calculus notation

        - Revisit [[May 16th, 2020]]
[[February 1st, 2020]]

- Great quote: not making it easier; making it **possible**; what an aspiration! Reminds me again of [[Bret Victor]]'s talk about ways of seeing [[@victorHumaneRepresentationThought2014]], and examples from history of how a medium really fundamentally changed what was possible to think

- Generally, these discussions make me think of [[Bret Victor]]'s work on [[dynamic media]] and [[DynamicLand]] (see, e.g., [[@victorHumaneRepresentationThought2014]])

    - In general, I think the idea of [[direct manipulation]] seems like a central principle

    - Also think that if there is a thread of work on [[dynamic media]] and [[material knowledge]], that would be a good place to start from in terms of SOTA for thinking about [[material knowledge]] of AI/ML for [[D/Democratizing Design]]

        - One possible opportunity for advancing the conversation: thinking about how users can (or if they can / should) acquire designerly [[material knowledge]] of ML for the systems they are co-designing
