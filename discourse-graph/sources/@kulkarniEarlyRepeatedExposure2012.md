        - Abstract

            - This article presents the results of an online creativity experi-ment (N = 81) that examines the effect of example timing on creative output. In the between-subjects experiment, partici-pants drew animals to inhabit an alien Earth-like planet while being exposed to examples early, late, or repeatedly during the experiment. We find that exposure to examples increases con-formity. Early exposure to examples improves creativity (mea-sured by the number of common and novel features in draw-ings, and subjective ratings by independent raters). Repeated exposure to examples interspersed with prototyping leads to even better results. However, late exposure to examples in-creases conformity, but does not improve creativity.
