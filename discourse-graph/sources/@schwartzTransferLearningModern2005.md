- Title:: Transfer of Learning from a Modern Multidisciplinary Perspective
- Author(s):: [[D. L. Schwartz]], [[J. D. Bransford]], [[D. Sears]], [[J. Mestre]]
- Abstract:: The transfer literature includes a variety of seemingly conflicting perspec- tives. Some argue that transfer is rare; others argue that transfer is ubiqui- tous; still others worry that transfer is an unworkable concept. Is the transfer literature filled with inherently contradictory claims, or is there a framework that can help illuminate how and why the varied positions on transfer are each pieces of the truth that can be reconciled through a broader theoretical foundation? We argue for the latter. To develop our ideas, we divide the chapter into four sections that: (a) Rethink the classic definition of transfer and show how it tends to misdiagnose important forms of knowing. (b) Differentiate transferring in to situations from transferring out of them. (c) Discuss studies that show that new ways to think about transferring in and out can reveal advantages of interactive instructional techniques that remain hidden from more traditional measures. (d) Propose a tentative learning and performance space that differentiates two dimensions of transferinnovation and efficiencyand provide an example of what research on optimal trajectories through this space might look like. We end with some potential next steps, including new thoughts about assessments that comple- ment but go beyond many standardized tests.
