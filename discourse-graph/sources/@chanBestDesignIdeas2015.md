        - Abstract

            - Design ideas often come from sources of inspiration (e.g., analogous designs, prior experiences). In this paper, we test the popular but unevenly supported hypothesis that conceptually distant sources of inspiration provide the best insights for creative production. Through text analysis of hundreds of design concepts across a dozen different design challenges on a Web-based innovation platform that tracks connections to sources of inspiration, we find that citing sources is associated with greater creativity of ideas, but conceptually closer rather than farther sources appear more beneficial. This inverse relationship between conceptual distance and design creativity is robust across different design problems on the platform. In light of these findings, we revisit theories of design inspiration and creative cognition.

‚Äú‚Ä¶With regard to quality, although there is slight discrepancy among average quality, maximum quality and the percentage of ideas having higher quality, the results of the second row of Figure 4 show a negative correlation between analogical distance and the quality of ideas: Stimuli of closer analogical distance (Near-field) generally trigger the generation of ideas which are more effective and more capable of matching the design specification. This is consistent with the findings of Chan, Dow, and Schunn (2015) and Srinivasan et al (2018): also in this experiment the quality of generated ideas. as inspired by near-field analogies is better than the ones inspired by the far-field analogy and control conditions.‚Ä¶‚Äù

----------------------------------------------------------------
‚Äú‚Ä¶The productive value of discovering design inspiration in strange places has elsewhere been investigated [3,4, 11] and rather robustly in a metaanalytical review of 43 design studies [22] which found that when designers identified a "single and uncommon source of inspiration (like a de Chirico painting), the designers engaged in "a deeper search in a specific and remote domain, facilitating the generation of highquality and novel ideas." A similar study [6] concurs with this finding, but with the caveat that "conceptually closer, rather than farther sources appear more beneficial." Is de Chirico's furniture or the dance works of Miller and Naharin "too far" from the interactive system they inspired?‚Ä¶‚Äù

----------------------------------------------------------------
‚Äú‚Ä¶One can use sufficient but not excessive domain-specific technologies to form a moderately novel center and infuse a small number of technologies from distant domains to form a highly novel extreme in the combination space. This finding about the novelty 'sweet spot' is aligned with those of Fu et al (2013) and Chan et al (2015), despite different definitions of novelty, different types of experiments, and different correlation factors. Another important finding is that the combination of scientific and broader knowledge apart from patentable technologies generally creates value for an invention, and it reinforces the added value of the sweet spot over other regions in the central-extreme novelty space.‚Ä¶‚Äù

----------------------------------------------------------------
‚Äú‚Ä¶In brief, we have identified a clear 'sweet spot' of invention in the central-extreme novelty space, with a statistical analysis of approximately 600,000 patents in the USPTO database. This finding supports the prior conjecture from engineering design research (Fu et al 2013). Knowledge of the specified sweet spot may further enable data-driven methods for assessing novelty and profiling inventors.‚Ä¶‚Äù
