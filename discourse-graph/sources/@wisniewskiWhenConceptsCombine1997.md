- the base of this work on forms of interpretation is in [[@wisniewskiWhenConceptsCombine1997]]'s account based on structural alignment from [[@markmanSplittingDifferencesStructural1993]] (p. 23).

    - in this way, this work connects quite closely with [[analogy]]

    - the key theoretical idea here is that similar pairs are easier to align and identify [[Z: Alignable differences]], which leads to simpler property transfer operations; in contrast, dissimilar pairs are harder to align, so people need to construct more novel and creative scenarios that can combine the two concepts
