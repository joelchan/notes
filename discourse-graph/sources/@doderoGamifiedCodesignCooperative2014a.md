        - Abstract

            - Co-design is an ideal approach to design with mixed teams that include learners and teachers. However, in modern learning contexts, learning and engagement are both key goals, and that poses several challenges to co-design. This paper investigates such challenges after outlining co-design and situating it in current user experience design trends. Then the paper uses the challenges to derive requirements for co-design, and shows how to meet requirements, fostering engagement as well as learning, by blending co-design with gamification and cooperative learning. It ends by showcasing a study that uses the blended co-design approach, and by outlining how this led to novel challenges and work.

                - key idea: everyone needs to be responsible for something

    - takeaways:

        - cc [[[[CLM]] - Marginalized user populations may require involvement of extra stakeholders who may complicate hearing the users' voices]], but secondary cite

        - something about juggling multiple objectives? opportunity cost? here they thought a challenge was making the codesign beneficial directly for learning. is this exacerbated when looking to expand PD to marginalized populations?

            - relevant cites

                - [[@mcnallyGainsParticipatoryDesign2017]] - tricky to measure gains/success of being part of PD

                    - [[Allison Druin]] resistant to formalizing quant measures (e.g., pre/post designs), don't want to start another "No Child Left Behind" for kids PD
