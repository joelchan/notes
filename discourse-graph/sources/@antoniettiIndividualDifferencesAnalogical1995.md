- Title:: Individual differences in analogical problem solving
- Author(s):: [[A. Antonietti]], [[M. A. Gioletta]]
- Abstract:: Five studies are reported whose aim was to assess whether in undergraduates analogical transfer of a solution strategy from a source story to an isomorphic target problem in a different domain is associated with individual differences in reasoning ability, cognitive style, academic curricula, and gender. In Study I there were no relationships between analogical problem solving and Ravens Progressive Matrices. Study 2 showed that field-independent subjects were more likely to be analogical solvers than field-dependent subjects. Study 3 failed to support the notion of a link between analogical transfer and right-left and verbal-visual styles of thinking. There was evidence that rates of analogical solutions were higher in adaptors than in innovators (Study 4) and in bio-medical than in humanities students (Study 5). Males tended to give analogical solutions more frequently than females. Results suggest that cognitive styles, rather than abilities, are involved in analogical problem solving.
