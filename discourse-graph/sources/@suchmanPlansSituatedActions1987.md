        - Abstract

            - This lively and original book offers a provocative critique of the dominant assumptions regarding human action and communication which underlie recent research in machine intelligence. Lucy Suchman argues that the planning model of interaction favoured by the majority of AI researchers does not take sufficient account of the situatedness of most human social behaviour. The problems that can arise as a result are pertinently, and often amusingly, illustrated by the careful analysis of a recorded interaction between novice users and an intelligent machine, whose design has failed to accommodate essential resources of successful human communication. [[Plans and Situated Actions]] presents a compelling case for the re-examination of current models underlying interface design. Lucy Suchman's proposals for a fresh characterisation of human-computer interaction which also incorporates recent insights from the social sciences provides a challenge that everyone interested in machine intelligence will seriously need to consider.

        - As with all things, estimating gets easier with practice, but let's be clear: you are never going to get accurate numbers. At best, you will get “good enough numbers.” (Beck, 2001) A good enough number will enable you to prioritize stories, reduce the scope as required, and identify when there is simply too much to do (versus “not enough time”).

        - When we estimate, we are not so much interested in the exact amount of time it will take to complete a task, but rather in its order of magnitude of time.

        - we frequently run teams of 4-16 people on projects lasting days to weeks to months to years, estimating and replanning after each weeklong iteration
