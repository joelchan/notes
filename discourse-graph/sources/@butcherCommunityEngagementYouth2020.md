        - Abstract

            - Aboriginal young people from rural areas in Australia are significantly over-represented in the youth justice system, and yet there is little evidence to indicate that current programs are having measurable success on rates of re-offending, suggesting alternative approaches are required. Drawing on new directions in human service policy that emphasise the importance of involving community in program design, this study reports the findings of a consultation with Aboriginal community members from one rural community to identify how the ecological validity of youth justice programs may be increased to be more responsive to local need. Eighteen Aboriginal community members from a town in Western New South Wales participated in semistructured interviews, guided by a culturally informed research methodology. Qualitative content analysis was used to identify key themes that the community saw as important in program design, highlighting the need for consistent levels of support for local and community-driven solutions. Proposed conditions to enhance the ecological validity of programs are discussed.

    - similarities to [[@ereteEmpoweredParticipationHow2017]] - already super involved in community

    - 18 Aboriginal

    - office space provided to set up the interview, and catering provided, also phone option: so kind of in between going there and having them come to you

    - needed intermediate person to help set up (similar to [[@ssozi-mugaruraSupportingCommunityNeeds2016]])

        - e.g., aboriginal member vouching for researcher

    - challenging because of long history of pain (hundreds of years!)

    - trust takes a long time

    - two possible layers of conflict with "westernised" "evidence-based" programs

        - local vs. ?

    - [[Salma Elsayed-Ali]] connections to development work: going in with good intentions, but end up doing more harm than good?

        - where is design already happening? do we need to make them do PD?

        - [[Joel Chan]]: do we need to make them designers? does that conflict with or cause them to shed their ways of knowing or cultural knowledge?

        - like Teach for America?

        - can we look at PD from a postcolonial lens? not just when PD can be ineffective, but also harmful/detrimental?

    - # discussion

        - these findings and themes are not directly from experiences doing [[Participatory Design]], but like [[@ereteEmpoweredParticipationHow2017]], they inform understanding of how to deeply engage with marginalized communities.

        - the themes of [extra stakeholders]([[[[CLM]] - Marginalized user populations may require involvement of extra stakeholders who may complicate hearing the users' voices]]) and [layers of interpretation]([[[[CLM]] - There is a tension between analyzing participants' direct inputs, and respecting their actual insights (vs. designers' interpretation) that is intensified when working with design partners who struggle to contribute more directly to design artifacts]]) seemed to show up again, with the latter having a more nuanced idea of ways of clashes in ways of knowing

        - themes of history and distrust also showed up again, reminiscent of [[@harringtonEngagingLowincomeAfrican2019a]], likely to show up with any marginalized community with long, deep histories of oppression and exploitation by communities connected to power (which often includes researchers and designers)
