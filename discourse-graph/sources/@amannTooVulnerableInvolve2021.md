- Title:: Too Vulnerable to Involve? Challenges of Engaging Vulnerable Groups in the Co-production of Public Services through Research
- Author(s):: [[Julia Amann]], [[Joanna Sleigh]]
- Abstract:: Involving the public in the co-production of research to inform public service delivery can help to ensure the appropriateness of services. However, vulnerable groups are often systematically excluded from these activities. To raise awareness and stimulate discussion, this review 1) describes how vulnerable groups are currently involved in the co-production of research aimed at improving public services; (2) consolidates the challenges researchers encountered in these instances; and (3) produces an overview of the emergent solutions and recommendations for overcoming these challenges. The authors conclude that critical reflection, mutual learning, and capacity building can promote the involvement of vulnerable groups.
