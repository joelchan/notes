        - > **A quality synthesis will clarify and resolve, rather than obscure inconsistencies or tensions between material synthesized.** Ideas from diverse sources need synthesizing because they are not initially consistent, commensurable, or do not clearly fit into a single framework. A synthesis which creates a common framework for initially diverse ideas should result in a clarification and resolution of the causes of such difficulties. It should not integrate material by obscuring the sense of the ideas, or by failing to note the distinctive role that particular concepts or ideas play in their initial conceptual frameworks. For example, we cannot synthesize differing views on the role of praise in learning by substituting the more neutral word praise for words such as reinforcement or feedback. This does not resolve the underlying conflict between behaviorist and cognitivist theories of motivation; it simply obscures them.

**A quality synthesis will result in a progressive problem shift.** Synthesis involves a conceptual innovation, as well as a reinterpretation of some of the ideas synthesized. Such a reinterpretation should be progressive and should increase our understanding of the materials synthesized. A progressive problem shift will exhibit such features as increased explanatory and predictive power and expanded empirical content, increased theoretical ability to explain ideas synthesized, expanded scope of application, and an increased capacity to identify and pursue unsolved problems.

**A successful synthesis will satisfy the formal criteria for good theories**. Such standards as consistency, parsimony, elegance, and fruitfulness characterize a good synthesis. (pp. 356-357)

            - Maybe the output itself isn't a "synthesis", but the people participating in the project of synthesis are changed and go on to create new things that they wouldn't have
