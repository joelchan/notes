        - > **A quality synthesis will clarify and resolve, rather than obscure inconsistencies or tensions between material synthesized.** Ideas from diverse sources need synthesizing because they are not initially consistent, commensurable, or do not clearly fit into a single framework. A synthesis which creates a common framework for initially diverse ideas should result in a clarification and resolution of the causes of such difficulties. It should not integrate material by obscuring the sense of the ideas, or by failing to note the distinctive role that particular concepts or ideas play in their initial conceptual frameworks. For example, we cannot synthesize differing views on the role of praise in learning by substituting the more neutral word praise for words such as reinforcement or feedback. This does not resolve the underlying conflict between behaviorist and cognitivist theories of motivation; it simply obscures them.

**A quality synthesis will result in a progressive problem shift.** Synthesis involves a conceptual innovation, as well as a reinterpretation of some of the ideas synthesized. Such a reinterpretation should be progressive and should increase our understanding of the materials synthesized. A progressive problem shift will exhibit such features as increased explanatory and predictive power and expanded empirical content, increased theoretical ability to explain ideas synthesized, expanded scope of application, and an increased capacity to identify and pursue unsolved problems.

**A successful synthesis will satisfy the formal criteria for good theories**. Such standards as consistency, parsimony, elegance, and fruitfulness characterize a good synthesis. (pp. 356-357)

- Specifically re: #[[Z: Theories are core examples of synthesis]], it will be valuable to build on what #[[@strikeTypesSynthesisTheir1983]] do to talk through a few canonical examples of [[synthesis]] through the paper to illustrate/speculate what kinds of standards/affordances of information objects would facilitate the creation of those artifacts, as well as how they might be impaired without those affordances. The interesting thing about this is that, at least in the case of [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of evolution, we have some nice evidence from his notebook (cf. #[[@gruberDarwinManPsychological1974]])!

    - We can start with a nice example of a theory that I should be more familiar with than I am: [[Prospect Theory]]. I want to understand it, but also analyze its properties in detail as an example of synthesis. #[[R: kahnemanProspectTheoryAnalysis1979]]

        - Side note: want to be careful that this doesn't devolve into "synthesis = science". It is certainly an absolutely __essential__ component of science. But is not the only component of science (at least if you're a strong empiricist :)).

            - Nevertheless, I think we can safely make the strong claim that [[[[CLM]] - Scientific fields stall without adequate theoretical synthesis]]

            - speaks to the nonlinearity [[compression]] and [[compositionality]]

        - It's also an interesting example because of how little Darwin had to build on in terms of previous "literature" compared to today (not 100% sure that's true, but that's my impression)!

            - And we can ask: is it possible for today's scientists and scholars to do work like this, with the increasing [[Burden of Knowledge]]? How might we build scholarly [[infrastructure]]s to enable this?

[[QUE - How might we conceptualize and measure synthesis quality]]

- In both cases, we need a firm conceptualization of synthesis quality. After previous work on synthesis in scholarly work [[@strikeTypesSynthesisTheir1983]][[@booteScholarsResearchersCentrality2005]], we can conceptualize synthesis quality along two major axes:

    - 2) The resulting synthesis contributes a **new, useful conceptual whole** that is not clearly seen in the individual or aggregated source materials. Examples of this might be a new understanding of a key concept that clarifies connections and differences across disciplinary boundaries; or a novel mechanism (and associated hypotheses to test) that might account for contradictory observations in a body of findings; or a novel relationship to examine between concepts not previously thought to be closely related; or a novel theory/model of a phenomenon.

    - 1) The resulting synthesis includes **critical engagement** with/across sources. Sources are not taken at face value, but are instead weighed and put in conversation with each other, bringing out key points of strength and weakness in individual studies, and articulating points of conflict and convergence across sources. Oten this entails articulating commonalities/differences in contextual details across sources that may not be commonly discussed. Examples of this might be an articulation of a key methodological gap in a body of evidence; or discussing how a few critical studies might outweigh a larger collection of weaker evidence, based on differences in internal and/or external validity; or identifying a possible mediator/moderator for a causal pathway based on systematic variations in effects across a contextual dimension.

- From[[@strikeTypesSynthesisTheir1983]]:

    - > **A quality synthesis will clarify and resolve, rather than obscure inconsistencies or tensions between material synthesized.** Ideas from diverse sources need synthesizing because they are not initially consistent, commensurable, or do not clearly fit into a single framework. A synthesis which creates a common framework for initially diverse ideas should result in a clarification and resolution of the causes of such difficulties. It should not integrate material by obscuring the sense of the ideas, or by failing to note the distinctive role that particular concepts or ideas play in their initial conceptual frameworks. For example, we cannot synthesize differing views on the role of praise in learning by substituting the more neutral word praise for words such as reinforcement or feedback. This does not resolve the underlying conflict between behaviorist and cognitivist theories of motivation; it simply obscures them.

    - > **A quality synthesis will result in a progressive problem shift.** Synthesis involves a conceptual innovation, as well as a reinterpretation of some of the ideas synthesized. Such a reinterpretation should be progressive and should increase our understanding of the materials synthesized. A progressive problem shift will exhibit such features as increased explanatory and predictive power and expanded empirical content, increased theoretical ability to explain ideas synthesized, expanded scope of application, and an increased capacity to identify and pursue unsolved problems.

    - > **A successful synthesis will satisfy the formal criteria for good theories**. Such standards as consistency, parsimony, elegance, and fruitfulness characterize a good synthesis.
