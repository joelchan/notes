    - #lit-context

        - one of a few more accessible introductions to the concept of [[communities of practice]]

            - #canonical refs are:

                - #[[@laveSituatedLearningLegitimate1991]]

                - Then #[[@wengerCommunitiesPracticeLearning1999]]

        - [[communities of practice]] are able to capture and share [[tacit knowledge]] that are difficult or impossible to represent in formal repositories p.5

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2Fdnh6mw8Qbm?alt=media&token=4a729b47-3d6e-4aa0-ba37-9b797483ace6)

        - Could COVID be an impetus for [[communities of practice]] to develop?

        - 3 conditions for [[communities of practice]]: 1) shared __practice__ (not specific task, but domain of doing), 2) mutual, ongoing engagement, 3) shared repertoire of learning / resources / practice (p. 2)

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FtndZeGkyXF.png?alt=media&token=bf9e9f00-ac23-4df9-b3fd-af2f609cf52e)

            - This later [source](http://www.linqed.net/media/15868/COPCommunities_of_practiceDefinedEWenger.pdf) calls the three things 1) domain, 2) community, and 3) practice

        - [[communities of practice]] go through distinct stages of development (p. 3)

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FwcUe2mCU3X.png?alt=media&token=99cb9264-e544-4485-8a2a-7fcb6a443033)

            - #[[I wonder]] where our small businesses are on this spectrum?

        - [[communities of practice]]' development depends critically on effective __internal leadership__ (p. 7)

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FM1XgOaeo4S.png?alt=media&token=2807ee1d-ef22-4e6a-b10c-136319318ac1)

            - #[[I wonder]] where [[librarians]] might fit in? seems like the [[classificatory leadership]] role might be key, as well as [[boundary leadership]] (concept of [[warm referrals]] from [[Ryan O Grady]]?)

                - later in this paper, the authors discuss ways that organizations who are *external* to the communities of practice can help nurture it.

                    - one way is by providing support (maybe [[infrastructure]])

                        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FRPJsSfkQCr.png?alt=media&token=9d39d2cb-bd22-4e48-96c0-45bb184f97a9) (p. 8)

- Reading #[[@wengerCommunitiesPracticeLearning1998]]

    - Again q of how to define the boundaries of the practice: what is the within/between ratio of variation in terms of what it means to "run/grow a small business" in neighborhood/city/municipality vs. county vs. state?

        - County does seem like the right level. But I'm not 100% sure.
