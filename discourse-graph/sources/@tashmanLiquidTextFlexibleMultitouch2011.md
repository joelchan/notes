[[CL - Synthesis is supported by Active Reading]]

- [[@tashmanLiquidTextFlexibleMultitouch2011]] is a decent entry point into the [[active reading]] literature

    - the [[[[ART]] - LiquidText]] system in particular is nicely grounded in [[@tashmanActiveReadingIts2011]], which is a nice formative study of active reading with interviews and [[Participatory Design]] workshops
