            - I give you some time to look at this

            - 00:01

            - quote okay so this is a neat quote for a

            - 00:13

            - number of reasons Engelbart is really

            - 00:16

            - criticizing k in this idea of being

            - 00:19

            - against user friendliness in case is

            - 00:22

            - admitting that Engelbart is partially

            - 00:25

            - right we remember Engelbart very

            - 00:29

            - offensive person who invented the

            - 00:30

            - computer mouse and that was what a lot

            - 00:33

            - of the obituaries ran we forget what

            - 00:37

            - came before the computer mouse it wasn't

            - 00:39

            - nothing it was the light and the light

            - 00:41

            - pen was this incredibly intuitive device

            - 00:44

            - right and people could look at a light

            - 00:46

            - pen and in five seconds they could

            - 00:47

            - understand how it worked and in ten

            - 00:49

            - seconds they could be using it the mouse

            - 00:51

            - was was not an intuitive device at all

            - 00:53

            - but what Engel Bart found is you put two

            - 00:56

            - people together you have them executed

            - 00:58

            - on the same task and initially the

            - 01:00

            - person with the mouse will be slower

            - 01:02

            - right but very quickly they start to

            - 01:04

            - outpace the person with light pen very

            - 01:08

            - quickly they start to achieve a fluidity

            - 01:10

            - of speed and expertise that the person

            - 01:13

            - with the late pen never achieves and so

            - 01:17

            - that's that's the lesson that I think

            - 01:19

            - Engelbart believed people hadn't heard

            - 01:24

            - right that we don't need to infantile

            - 01:28

            - eyes our users that as a matter of fact

            - 01:32

            - if we can figure out what would work for

            - 01:35

            - our users the best after several weeks

            - 01:39

            - of using a tool instead what we've ended

            - 01:42

            - up doing is we live in a world of light

            - 01:45

            - pens you can enter you can introduce the

            - 01:48

            - mouse today to people marketing wouldn't

            - 01:51

            - let you and that's the reason why is

            - 01:53

            - 2014 and you're still copying and

            - 01:55

            - pasting text to move it places trying to

            - 01:58

            - clean up formatting is carried from one

            - 01:59

            - place to another that's the reason why

            - 02:01

            - people are bragging that you know

            - 02:04

            - infants can use iPads as if this was

            - 02:06

            - some point of pride rather than

            - 02:10

            - something horrifying this is why we live

            - 02:12

            - in

            - 02:13

            - world where most things are very easy to

            - 02:15

            - learn but they're hard to use and I

            - 02:19

            - guess by hard to use I don't mean that

            - 02:21

            - we feel that they're difficult but then

            - 02:24

            - we never actually reach our capacity to

            - 02:28

            - really meld with these systems because

            - 02:31

            - we've chosen you know these these easier

            - 02:34

            - paths federated wiki is hard to learn

            - 02:38

            - and it's easy to use and I know that

            - 02:41

            - sounds to some people like a con but

            - 02:45

            - inside in many ways it's a warning to

            - 02:48

            - people that are taking this course you

            - 02:50

            - are going to have to radically

            - 02:53

            - reconfigure your assumptions in

            - 02:56

            - intuitions about what the web is and how

            - 03:00

            - the web works that's going to be that's

            - 03:04

            - going to be difficult the reward for

            - 03:06

            - that is if you get past it you get to be

            - 03:11

            - the guy with the mouse or the or the

            - 03:13

            - woman with the mouse in a world of

            - 03:15

            - people who still are clinging to their

            - 03:18

            - light pens so with that pep talk I want

            - 03:22

            - to start off by talking about one thing

            - 03:25

            - that I have to introduce people to

            - 03:27

            - before they use the system and I've got

            - 03:32

            - I've got a note down here just a visual

            - 03:34

            - aid um here we go this is something that

            - 03:43

            - if you don't understand that so you

            - 03:45

            - don't understand the implications of

            - 03:47

            - this that federated wiki is not a

            - 03:49

            - website your life will be pain for the

            - 03:54

            - entire 14 days your life will be pain

            - 03:56

            - and I want to walk you through what this

            - 03:58

            - means the federated wiki is not a

            - 04:00

            - website some of the implications of it

            - 04:02

            - and hopefully we can cut down on some of

            - 04:06

            - the some of the initial initial

            - 04:10

            - confusion that a lot of people get when

            - 04:11

            - they go into federated wiki

        - Abstract

            - Federated Wiki is Hard to Learn, Easy to Use. Introduction to the Happening.

    - #[[üìù lit-notes]]

        - quote about how [[sys/Federated Wikis]] are "hard to learn, easy to use" and the rant about how we're tied to "easy to learn, hard to use" (placing upper limit on our capabilities for the sake of [[usability]]) resonates with me, reminds me of the tensions we're seeing in [[sys/Zettelkasten]], and [[desirable difficulty]] in #[[@qianOpeningBlackBox2020]], and convo with [[Beck Tench]] on [[October 15th, 2019]] [[sys/TinderBox]] feels "moral"
