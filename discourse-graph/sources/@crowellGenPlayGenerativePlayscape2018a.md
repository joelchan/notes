            - Abstract

                - Despite increased focus on classroom support, children with cognitive and learning disorders still face high levels of social exclusion in integrative mainstream schools due to impairments in social communication. Following previous structured social technological interventions which have proved useful in increasing social skills of children with Autism, this research outlines the methodologies followed to develop a virtual environment system which may rapidly transform a standard classroom into an interactive play space. Research methods included field studies, stakeholder interviews, requirements gathering, prototype construction and feedback, and usability testing. This research in developing classroom technologies stands to pose significant benefits to this group of individuals at risk of social exclusion due to cognitive or learning conditions.
