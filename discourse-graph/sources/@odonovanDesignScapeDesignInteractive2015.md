- Title:: DesignScape: Design with Interactive Layout Suggestions
- Author(s):: [[Peter O'Donovan]], [[Aseem Agarwala]], [[Aaron Hertzmann]]
- Abstract:: Creating graphic designs can be challenging for novice users. This paper presents DesignScape, a system which aids the design process by making interactive layout suggestions, i.e., changes in the position, scale, and alignment of elements. The system uses two distinct but complementary types of suggestions: reﬁnement suggestions, which improve the current layout, and brainstorming suggestions, which change the style. We investigate two interfaces for interacting with suggestions. First, we develop a suggestive interface, where suggestions are previewed and can be accepted. Second, we develop an adaptive interface where elements move automatically to improve the layout. We compare both interfaces with a baseline without suggestions, and show that for novice designers, both interfaces produce signiﬁcantly better layouts, as evaluated by other novices.

            - ### summary

                - The high level similarity between this work and my research idea comes from leveraging machines to explore design alternatives. This work introduces two ways of providing graphic design recommendations: refinement suggestions and brainstorming suggestions. The refinement suggestions are small tweaks for current layout which could be seen as gradient descent and suggestions could be regarded as exploration or “creative leaps”. Particularly they used an energy-based model to generate designs that encode design principles such as symmetry, alignment, and overlap. I think the energy-based model is similar to the language model with various initial examples with design principles encoded.

            - Two comparisons: adaptive interface & baseline (no suggestions); suggestive interface & baseline (no suggestions)
