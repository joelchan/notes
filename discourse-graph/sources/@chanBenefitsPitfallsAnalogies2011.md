        - Abstract

            - Drawing inspiration from examples by analogy can be a powerful tool for innovative design during conceptual ideation but also carries the risk of negative design outcomes (e.g., design fixation), depending on key properties of examples. Understanding these properties is critical for effectively harnessing the power of analogy. The current research explores how variations in analogical distance, commonness, and representa- tion modality influence the effects of examples on conceptual ideation. Senior-level engi- neering students generated solution concepts for an engineering design problem with or without provided examples drawn from the U.S. Patent database. Examples were crossed by analogical distance (near-field vs. far-field), commonness (more vs. less-common), and modality (picture vs. text). A control group that received no examples was included for comparison. Effects were examined on a mixture of ideation process and product var- iables. Our results show positive effects of far-field and less-common examples on novelty and variability in quality of solution concepts. These effects are not modulated by modal- ity. However, detailed analyses of process variables suggest divergent inspiration path- ways for far-field vs. less-common examples. Additionally, the combination of far-field, less-common examples resulted in more novel concepts than in the control group. These findings suggest guidelines for the effective design and implementation of design-by-anal- ogy methods, particularly a focus on far-field, less-common examples during the ideation process.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Table 7 includes t and p values from paired t tests comparing Q Total of Phase I and II for the three experimental conditions. It was found that NT has no statistically significant difference (which is expected because Phase II is also nonassisted), which in the case of WT there is a statistically significant difference, consistent with previous cognitive studies where intervention scenarios add significant load because of the cognitive processing (Tseng, Moss, Cagan, & Kotovsky, 2008; Chan et al, 2011 a , 2011 b ). In the case of SCA, there was no statistically significant difference.‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶Such ‚Äúfar analogies‚Äù may be what help to make mental leaps of imagination though they are thought to require a greater level of cognitive effort. Such a view is consistent with those who propose that conceptually far sources yield more creative ideas (e.g., Chan, Schunn, Cagan, Wood, & Kotovsky, 2011; Dahl & Moreau, 2002). However, others have found equivalent benefits when using both near and far analogies (Enkel & Gassmann, 2010; Tseng, Moss, Cagan, & Kotovsky, 2008).‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶The authors assume that the more distant two concepts chosen, the more novel idea would come up with by the combination of the two concepts. According with prior works which focus on analogical distance and concept generation performance, the analogy from knowledge of farer field tends to lead to the more novel concepts (Chan et al, 2011;Taura and Nagai, 2013). They support the assumption of this research.‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶Results in this paper further suggest that in the given context, concepts generated using patents from the far field or the combination of the home and far fields have a higher average quality than the concepts stimulated by patents from other individual fields or combinations. This seems to contradict the findings of Fu et al (2013b) that solutions generated using stimuli from near sources had higher quality than those generated using far sources, but support the findings of Chan et al (2011) that stimuli from far sources were more beneficial for developing solutions of higher quality. However, these studies and ours might not be comparable, primarily because the characterization of near and far is not the same.‚Ä¶‚Äù
