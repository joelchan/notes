        - Maps [[Bloom's taxonomy]] to levels of writing in a literature review or synthesis output for graduate writing

        - Applies [[Bloom's taxonomy]] to describe the levels of lit-reviewing complexity, where we have a qualitative shift from analysis level (still mostly lists of papers, paper-centric) to synthesis (thematically organized, argument-based), and eventually going to evaluation (gap-finding - this is what i trust, where i'm uncertain, etc.). No rigorous empirical data here, though, still anecdotal, largely

            - the idea of evaluation and clear criteria for gaps is an important observation that connects with why [[context]] matters.

        - Note: they use the earlier version of [[Bloom's taxonomy]]; there is an updated version where the stages have been renamed (e.g., synthesis is no longer there; instead, it is called "create" at the highest level; see discussion [here](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/))
