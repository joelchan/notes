- Title:: What is an "explanation" of behavior?
- Author(s):: [[H. A. Simon]]
- Abstract:: The cognitive "revolution" in psychology introduced a new concept of explanation and somewhat novel methods of gath- ering and interpreting evidence. These innovations assume that it is essential to explain complex phenomena at several levels, symbiylic as well as physiological: complementary, not compet- itive. As with the other sciences, such complementarity makes possible a comprehensive and unified experimental psychology. Contemporary cognitive psychology also introduced comple- mentarity of another kind, drawing upon, and drawing to- gether, both the behaviorist and the Gestalt traditions.
