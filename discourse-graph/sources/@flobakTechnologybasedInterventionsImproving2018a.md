            - Abstract

                - In this paper, we address designing for the delivery of timely cues to initiate skill-building exercises for improving emotional and cognitive control. W focus on adults with ADHD, as they frequently experience difficulties related to such control. We describe the design and current user experience evaluation of TimeOut - a skill-building assistive technology to be used by adults with ADHD to improve long-term mastery of self-regulatory abilities. TimeOut, in its current iteration, consists of a wristband monitoring physiological signals, visualization of these signals, an algorithm to prompt interventions, and the delivery of a skill-building exercise on a mobile phone.
