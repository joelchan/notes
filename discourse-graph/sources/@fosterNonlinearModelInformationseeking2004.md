        - Abstract

            - This paper offers a new, nonlinear model of information-seeking behavior, which contrasts with earlier stage models of information behavior and represents a potential cornerstone for a shift toward a new perspective for understanding user information behavior. The model is based on the findings of a study on interdisciplinary information-seeking behavior. The study followed a naturalistic inquiry approach using interviews of 45 academics. The interview results were inductively analyzed and an alternative framework for understanding information-seeking behavior was developed. This model illustrates three core processes and three levels of contextual interaction, each composed of several individual activities and attributes. These interact dynamically through time in a nonlinear manner. The behavioral patterns are analogous to an artist's palette, in which activities remain available throughout the course of information-seeking. In viewing the processes in this way, neither start nor finish points are fixed, and each process may be repeated or lead to any other until either the query or context determine that information-seeking can end. The interactivity and shifts described by the model show information-seeking to be nonlinear, dynamic, holistic, and flowing. The paper offers four main implications of the model as it applies to existing theory and models, requirements for future research, and the development of information literacy curricula. Central to these implications is the creation of a new nonlinear perspective from which user information-seeking can be interpreted.

    - intro has many papers that are worth referencing for us, talking about how models of [[information behavior]] do a good job of modeling *disciplinary* information seeking, but are far from sufficient for describing interdisciplinary information-seeking, leaving core questions posed by [[@bates1996learning]] basically unanswered

            - This paper in general

                - Reading notes: studies the information seeking behavior of ((bRJ0i2ojg)) scholars. This problem has not been investigated before.

            - Claim that suggests clarification: The InfoSci assumption is that the
orignaization, description, indexing of inofmration in forms of indexes,
catalogs, and reference books makes information accessible to users.

                - Xin’s question/comment: not sure whether we
could say information is cross-boundary, or the attribute of cross-boundary **lies in its use** by interdisciplinary people

                    - Social construction of technology

                        - (Also as SCOT) is a theory within the field of science and technology studies. Advocates of SCOT argue that technology does not determine human action, but that rather, human action shapes technology.

                    - Answer: why is information that is analogy far apart initially? Boundaries are there for what reason?

                        - Maybe attention, or information-noise ratio? Different classification categories. Prioritize other kinds of metadata which are missing from current infrastructure.

            - Potential and indirect claim: Citation indexes are likely useful signals for interdisciplinary researchers. The fact that citation index sometimes coming from **someone** in another field or is inherited afterwards by another field bypasses the vocabulary mismatch problem across different fields.

                - There might be a process starting from the first citation attempt between domain A and domain B. It fruits into interdisciplinary journals (Bioinformatics, etc. )
