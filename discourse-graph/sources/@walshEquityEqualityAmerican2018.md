        - Abstract

            - Co-design is considered a powerful tool to empower users to be part of the design process. In the United States, co-design with children is often associated with academic organizations. In one form of co-design, Cooperative Inquiry, children and adults design together in a lab environment. Unfortunately, children who live in non-afÔ¨Çuent areas may have trouble participating in groups like this because they are unable to attend design sessions due to a combination of lack of transit options or parental involvement.

            - The study was conducted over 4 years in Baltimore with 35 different children. The study focuses on the 4th year due to issues obtaining participants from racially and economic backgrounds. The goal was achieved during the 4th year which had 14 participants in a co-design process. at libraries in Baltimore City.

            - During the 4th year Studies were conducted at a libraries in underserved communities with a total of 14 children participating throughout the year. Attendance was voluntary. Children could leave the session at any time without question.
