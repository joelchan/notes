        - Abstract

            - Co-design is considered a powerful tool to empower users to be part of the design process. In the United States, co-design with children is often associated with academic organizations. In one form of co-design, Cooperative Inquiry, children and adults design together in a lab environment. Unfortunately, children who live in non-afÔ¨Çuent areas may have trouble participating in groups like this because they are unable to attend design sessions due to a combination of lack of transit options or parental involvement.

            - The study was conducted over 4 years in Baltimore with 35 different children. The study focuses on the 4th year due to issues obtaining participants from racially and economic backgrounds. The goal was achieved during the 4th year which had 14 participants in a co-design process. at libraries in Baltimore City.

            - During the 4th year Studies were conducted at a libraries in underserved communities with a total of 14 children participating throughout the year. Attendance was voluntary. Children could leave the session at any time without question.

- [[@walshEquityEqualityAmerican2018]] for [[[[QUE]] - What tension points exist between the goals of diversity and depth of user participation in participatory design?]]: travel and time constraints for children from low-SES neighborhoods, had to compromise on length/focus (scope down)

    - There were a couple other observations that were extracted that we're not quite sure are relevant to this question yet, but want to record them here in case issues of consent come up again.

        - In particular, there's something similar here in the following observation and [[@tengParticipatoryDesignVirtual2019b]]'s observation of the [need for an advocate]([[[[EVD]] - Working with an advocate within the prison system allowed researchers to navigate bureaucratic hierarchy with relative ease - @tengParticipatoryDesignVirtual2019b]]):

            - [Issues with obtaining consent](![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2Ff3Om-CxLTN.png?alt=media&token=6c96ef43-9dfb-4b32-97a2-1729fb91f933) pg 437) from [children](((slZCVGK1p))) presented a challenge being that there were no parents at the libraries with the children. The IRB met and came to the conclusion that being that no harm could come to the children consent wouldn't be required but that a consent form would be sent home with the children.

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2Ff3Om-CxLTN.png?alt=media&token=6c96ef43-9dfb-4b32-97a2-1729fb91f933) pg 437

        - These issues around consent placed some limitations on who could be involved, it looks like, which... might be an issue?

            - A [librarian](![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FK15glLyJYY.png?alt=media&token=1821980f-eaeb-47f3-b8ea-3db14605c777) pg 438) suggested the design process focus on the [children's safety and security](((nEiFDxKz9))). This level of respect for them allowed the [children](((slZCVGK1p))) to devise prototypes which were relevant to their community and aided in the engagement of the children.

- drafted notes for [[@walshEquityEqualityAmerican2018]] #obsnoteinbox for [[[[QUE]] - What tension points exist between the goals of diversity and depth of user participation in participatory design?]]

    - added notes for context for [first three years](The study was conducted over 4 years in Baltimore with 35 different children. The study focuses on the 4th year due to issues obtaining participants from racially and economic backgrounds. The goal was achieved during the 4th year which had 14 participants in a co-design process. at libraries in Baltimore City.) and [final year](((AsyCy8Tcq))) of the study

    - added observation notes for [travel and time constraints](issues with [travel and time](((1wrkXgkS4))) constraints kept [children](((jKDV9geaV))) from underserved communities and who attended after school activities from attending lab sessions in the first 3 years.)

    - added observation notes for [change in duration of design sessions](Design sessions were changed from year long projects to [month long projects](((lVW0KB9hI))) and focused on one design problem rather that multiple problems)

    - added observation notes for issues [obtaining consent from children with no adult support]([Issues with obtaining consent](((Qhehb1K9b))) from [children](((slZCVGK1p))) presented a challenge being that there were no parents at the libraries with the children. The IRB met and came to the conclusion that being that no harm could come to the children consent wouldn't be required but that a consent form would be sent home with the children.)

    - added observation notes for [solutions to designing with no outside design partner](A [librarian](((fmsxRJp3s))) suggested the design process focus on the [children's safety and security](((nEiFDxKz9))). This level of respect for them allowed the [children](((slZCVGK1p))) to devise prototypes which were relevant to their community and aided in the engagement of the children.)

- what did we get from [[@walshEquityEqualityAmerican2018]]

    - mainly `observation notes` in the form of reflections from a 4-year effort to expand co-design into Baltimore City and they really struggled in the first 3 years

        - even considered scrapping the project after the end of the 3rd year

    - these look great! very effective

    - just moved the blocks to an appropriate spot. check it out [here](#[[üìù lit-notes]])

    - i'll do a second pass check to make sure we didn't miss anything
[[July 6th, 2021]]

- This reminds me very much of [[[[EVD]] - Children from underserved communities were often unable to attend in-lab PD sessions due to travel and time constraints - [[@walshEquityEqualityAmerican2018]]]], which literally had the same thing about extracurricular sports.

    - I wonder about the changing significance of these activities as you move between socioeconomic and other dimensions of marginalization - how "optional" are these?
[[February 24th, 2021]]

- e.g., [[@walshEquityEqualityAmerican2018]] reports they had to make co-design sessions a lot shorter and also located in local libraries (vs. in the university lab)

- A similar theme comes from [[@walshEquityEqualityAmerican2018]], who reported that A [librarian](((fmsxRJp3s))) suggested the design process focus on the [children's safety and security](((nEiFDxKz9))). This level of respect for them allowed the [children](((slZCVGK1p))) to devise prototypes which were relevant to their community and aided in the engagement of the children.

    - This, together with [[@harringtonDeconstructingCommunityBasedCollaborative2019]]'s observation about the [very different nature of solutions]([Codesign participants](((qh0YSXotw))) [wanted to brainstorm more realistic ideas](((83JOKv-Go))) that respected their resource constraints and were closer to resources they could control, rather "out of the box" ideas that ignored these constraints or relied on resources from researchers or local governance. An example of this sort of idea was a resident petition to be issued to housing authority committees.) generated by deep participation, illustrates the potential value of deep user participation in the design process.
[[June 10th, 2021]]

- [[@walshEquityEqualityAmerican2018]] reported that issues with [travel and time](((1wrkXgkS4))) constraints kept [children](((jKDV9geaV))) from underserved communities and who attended after school activities from attending lab sessions in the first 3 years.

    - To accommodate this, Design sessions were changed from year long projects to [month long projects](((lVW0KB9hI))) and focused on one design problem rather that multiple problems
[[February 24th, 2021]]

- {{[[DONE]]}} [[AJ Rudd Jr]] transfer observation notes from paper to [[@walshEquityEqualityAmerican2018]] by [[March 3rd, 2021]]

    - Also add "[solutions](don't just look for tension points, but also look for "solutions" (what did people feel they needed to do/change to increase inclusion, and do we have any evidence that those changes worked?))"
