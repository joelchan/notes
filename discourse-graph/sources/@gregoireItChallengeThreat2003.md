- Title:: Is It a Challenge or a Threat? A Dual-Process Model of Teachers Cognition and Appraisal Processes During Conceptual Change
- Author(s):: [[M. Gregoire]]
- Abstract:: What accounts for well-meaning teachers lack of implementation of subject- matter reforms, such as making ones classroom centered on problem solving, even when they positively value the reform and believe they are implementing it in their classrooms? Teachers subject-matter beliefs may constrain them from adopting practices that conflict with those beliefs. The purpose of this article is to propose a theoretical model, the CognitiveAffective Model of Conceptual Change, that integrates key findings from overly cognitive mod- els of belief change with motivational and affective factors found in social psychology theory and research. This model explains why teachers beliefs about instruction are resistant to reforms that challenge their existing be- liefs, and it provides a conceptual framework within which to devise a better means of advancing teachers beliefs and supporting them in the process of implementation.

    - (0) A cognitive-affective model of conceptual change is proposed to account for the phenomenon that many teachers do not successfully adopt teaching reforms, but rather continue to use prior methods of teaching, and are often unaware that they have not really change. This model attempts to bring together insights from conceptual change and dual-process attitude change models that emphasize the primacy of deliberate processing for belief change and the need for motivation and ability to effect deliberate processing, and insights from social psychology models of persuasion that specify the role of prior cognitive and affective structures (e.g., beliefs, goals, attitudes, subjective norms) in framing new information. A fundamental assumption of this model is the hypothesis that conceptual change is facilitated by deliberate rather than heuristic, automatic processing of new information, which is assumed to lead primarily to superficial belief change. Another key underlying premise is that deliberate processing is cognitively and motivationally expensive, and therefore requires reasonable amounts of ability and motivation. Finally, it is assumed that prior attitudes, beliefs, and goals critically influence whether new information is appraised as potentially stressful or benign, and that the former appraisal is a critical precursor to deliberate processing and eventual deep conceptual change. In this model, successful belief change only comes out about when new information is appraised as a potentially stressful challenge, but the teacher feels self-efficacious and possesses sufficient resources (e.g., time, knowledge) to meet the challenge, and the outcome of deliberate processing is agreement with the utility of belief change. If teachers appraise the new information as a challenge but do not believe that they possess the resources to meet that challenge (or they do not in fact possess the requisite resources), then the new information is appraised as a threat, which ultimately leads to heuristic processing, which results in superficial assimilation at best. Furthermore, benign positive appraisals of new information lead to superficial heuristic processing and consequent superficial belief change at best.
