        - Abstract

            - In the last three decades, simulation has become a key tool in the training of doctors and the maintenance of patient safety. Simulation offers an immersive, realistic way of learning technical skills. Recent changes to the training schemes in many surgical specialities mean that the hours spent working between senior house officer and consultant have been reduced. This, combined with other pressures (such as reduced operating hours), means that surgery has moved away from its traditional apprenticeship model and toward a competency-based one. Simulation can be a standardized and safe method for training and assessing surgeons. Use of simulation for training has become significant alongside the development of laparoscopic techniques, and evidence suggests that skills obtained in simulation are applicable in real clinical scenarios. Simulation allows trainees to make mistakes, to ask the “what if?” questions, and to learn and reflect on such situations without risking patient safety. Virtual reality simulators have been used to allow experts to plan complicated operations and assess perioperative risks. Most recently, fully immersive simulations, such as those with whole theater teams involved, and patient-centered simulations allow development of other key skills aside from purely technical ones. Use of simulation in isolation from traditional teaching methods will furnish the surgeon in training with skills, but the best time and place to use such skills comes only with experience. In this article we examine the role of simulation in surgical training and its impact in the context of reduced training time.

            - Such changes have heralded a transition in surgical training from an apprenticeship model, where the learner imitates the actions of a skilled mentor and which relies on subjective evaluations, to a more objective and competency-based attitude that requires the trainee to be more “hands-on” in his or her own approach to training.[20](#i0020-8868-100-2-350-b20),[21](#i0020-8868-100-2-350-b21) Other drivers for change include the rise of [[evidence-based medicine]], medical error statistics, rising student numbers, bed occupancy and theater time pressures, decreasing patient availability, changing patient attitudes, rising patient and public expectations, and wider societal changes.[22](#i0020-8868-100-2-350-b22)–[24](#i0020-8868-100-2-350-b24)

            - Work by a number of researchers has shown that the addition of haptic feedback in early training may enhance the trainee's sensory perception and facilitate the transfer of skills from the simulator to the operating room.

            - From personal experience, simulation allows trainees to ask the sorts of “what if?” questions they were previously too afraid to ask or that would cause embarrassment in front of patients or colleagues

            - Trainees can also learn not just immediately from mistakes, but can potentially see their natural conclusion, a totally unethical position if a real patient were involved.

            - immersive environments will help to develop difficult scenario pattern recognition
