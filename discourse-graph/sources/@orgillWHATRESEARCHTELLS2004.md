    - [[[[EVD]] - Students believe analogies have a purpose if they aid in understanding complex information, when they are having trouble visualizing a concept and when they are presented new material - [[@orgillWHATRESEARCHTELLS2004]]]]

    - [[[[EVD]] - Their are times when according to students analogies should not be used such as when they understand the material, when the target concepts are too overwhelming and when information needs to be memorized and not understood conceptually - [[@orgillWHATRESEARCHTELLS2004]]]]

    - Students claim analogies should not be used when being presented already understood material

    - Students claim that when target concepts are overwhelming analogies can be a hindrance

    - Students claim that information must be memorized should not be demonstrated with analogy

    - [[[[EVD]] - Analogies should be used in a classroom only after they have been well thought out, made to reduce any confusion, the purpose should be clear and they should be easy to remember. - [[@orgillWHATRESEARCHTELLS2004]]]]
