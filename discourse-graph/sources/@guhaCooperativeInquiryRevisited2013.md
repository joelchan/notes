        - Abstract

            - Since its creation, the Cooperative Inquiry method of designing technology with and for children has been refined, expanded, and sometimes questioned. Cooperative Inquiry has been adopted and used widely throughout the world, and it continues to evolve and grow to meet current needs. This paper examines the origins of Cooperative Inquiry, discusses how it has changed since its original inception, and clarifies the intent of its techniques. This paper concludes by presenting how Cooperative Inquiry can support designing with and for today’s international, independent, interactive, and information active children in the context of the developing world, mobile computing, social computing, and the ubiquity of search.

        - [[Allison Druin]] was head of [[KidsTeam]]

        - Most of these claims are going to come from experiences running [[KidsTeam]] sessions with kids between 7 - 11 years (p. 15)

        - A bit more about [[KidsTeam]] sessions:

            - They have been successful (five examples listed on p. 19)

        - "Cooperative Inquiry is a method of design partnering in which adults and children work together" (p. 14)

        - "Design" within a Cooperative Inquiry context is defined as "the steps necessary to conceive, develop, and produce a technology" (p. 14)

        - Adult partner takes notes on the __Big Ideas__ on a white board during presentation (p. 15)

        - Ways of designing with children change over the years and evolve to suit the needs of a given context, which shows that our studies on improving the methods/methodologies is valid (p 16)

        - Children of different ages need different things (for example, children 4-6 years need support in collaboration while children 10-13 years need guidance when low-tech prototyping) (p. 16) #barrier

        - Children play three roles as design partners (p. 16):

        - The most important goal of design partnership between adults and children is idea elaboration (p. 16) #benefit

        - **Assumption one:** "The technological complexity and richness of a child's environment today is different than the childhood environment in which today's adults grew up" and "Today's children are experts at what it means to be a child today" (p. 17)

        - Can streamline process when coming up with kid-friendly solutions to potentially development-halting issues (11) #benefit

        - **Assumption two:** "existing power structures between adults and children cannot be overcome" (p. 17)

        - Design partnering goes against power structures (p. 17) #benefit

        - 'We do not try to change all pre-existing adult/child relationships, merely the ones that exist in the context of the design process" (p. 18)

        - **Assumption three**: child does not have to have special characteristics in order to be a design partner. In essence, anyone can be a design partner and has something to contribute (p. 18) #benefit

        - **Assumption four:** Informant design (working with children at specific points in time) vs design partnering (children involved in all stages) (p. 18)

        - **Assumption five:** children can remind us of the obvious and teach us to consider the impossible (p. 18) #benefit

        - **Assumption five**: Many of the things children come up with can be usable and are fantastical (p. 18) #benefit

        - **Assumption six**: children in the design team are not limited representatives (p. 19)

        - Couldn't make sense of how this relates to our core question?

        - But the snippet includes something that could be useful: there seems to be a tension between the "operational" needs of the adult design partners (e.g., "classroom management"), and the participation needs of the child design partners. The authors believe this might be due to past experiences of working with children, possibly outside of a design setting.

- Typical setup (see, e.g., section 1 in [[@guhaCooperativeInquiryRevisited2013]]):

    - N (~3-4) adult design partners

        - Would map to "designers" in a [[Participatory Design]] setting without children

    - N (~6-8) child design partners

        - Would map to "users" in a [[Participatory Design]] setting without children
