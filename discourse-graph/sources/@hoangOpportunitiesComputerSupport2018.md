        - Abstract

            - [[systematic review]] is a type of literature review designed to synthesize all available evidence on a given question. [[systematic review]]s require significant time and effort, which has led to the continuing development of computer support. This paper seeks to identify the gaps and opportunities for computer support. By interviewing experienced [[systematic review]]ers from diverse fields, we identify the technical problems and challenges reviewers face in conducting a [[systematic review]] and their current uses of computer support. We propose potential research directions for how computer support could help to speed the [[systematic review]] process while retaining or improving review quality.
