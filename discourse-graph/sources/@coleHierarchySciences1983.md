        - Abstract

            - For 200 years it has been assumed that the sciences are arranged in a hierarchy, with developed natural sciences like physics at the top and social sciences like sociology at the bottom. Sciences at the top of the hierarchy presumably display higher levels of consensus and more rapid rates of advancement than those at the bottom. A distinction is made between two classes of knowledge: the core, or fully evaluated and universally accepted ideas which serve as the starting points for graduate education, and the research frontier, or all research currently being conducted. Data are presented from a set of empirical studies which show that, at the top and at the bottom of the hierarchy in either cognitive consensus or the rate at which new ideas are incorporated. It is concluded that in all sciences knowledge at the research frontier is a loosely woven web characterized by substantial levels of disagreement and difficulty in determining which contributions will turn out to be significant. Even at the research frontier, however, minimal levels of consensus are a necessary condition for the accumulation of knowledge. Consensus in all sciences is maintained by sociological processes such as the evaluation and reward systems.

    - intellectual lineage

        - [[hierarchy of the sciences]] idea from [[Auguste Comte]] in history of sciences

        - [[Thomas Kuhn]] paradigms - some are "preparadigmatic", so less consensus about shared theoretical structures and methodological approaches

        - availability of shared and mature theory is a proxy for legibility, probably, because it can provide a shared framework against which to judge contributions

        - here, these authors talk about "cognitive consensus"

        - distinction between "core and "frontier"

            - maybe there is a sense of the "size" and stability of the core? by proxy, level of agreement (over time) across syllabi?

            - seems related, but not identical to the idea of [[Core and Scatter]]

    - second half follows distinctino between core and frontier, and is an attempt to explain this null finding; hypothesize that the data so far was at the frontier; what about the core? this is the primary study here

            - no significant differences in relationship between citations and full professor promotion decisions

            - no significant differences in high citation performers x age (no more young high performers in "high consensus" fields)

                - this makes me think of [[@jonesAgeGreatInvention2010]] - IIRC they had different results? or maybe it was just increasing over time, but no big differences across fields? or maybe it was one of [[Dean Simonton]]'s papers?

        - these are the ones to dig into that have the actual evidence #[[âž° breadcrumbs]]

    - ratio of core to frontier is proxy for "cognitive consensus" hierarchy?
[[QUE - (How) do fields of innovation vary in their legibility of quality]]

- [[@coleHierarchySciences1983]] basically clarifies and sharpens this claim because they don't find any evidence for this, and instead have reviewed a bunch of papers and conclude the [opposite]([[Opposed By]]) in terms of the research frontier:

    - [[[[CLM]] - There is no systematic variation in consensus across fields on judging quality of contributions to research frontiers - [[@coleHierarchySciences1983]]]]
[[September 10th, 2021]]

- [[@coleHierarchySciences1983]] [[@coleHierarchySciences1983]] argues that basically frontier-level measures (citation concentration, obsolescence, peer review IRR, peer evals) don't give us much signal, but ["core knowledge" measures (e.g., textbooks) probably will]([[[[CLM]] - There is systematic variation in consensus of the core knowledge of fields - [[@coleHierarchySciences1983]]]]).

    - I think a concrete idea might be to use data from [[OpenSyllabus.org]] to sort of replicate the measures of age distribution of references and total number of references

    - #[[âž° breadcrumbs]] need to follow up on this though. this was work done in the early days; follow citation trails forward.

        - frustrating because the paper has like ~600 citations on Google Scholar, but only 2 "meaningful" ones on [Scite](https://scite.ai/reports/the-hierarchy-of-the-sciences-XpQYXw?contradicting=false&mentioning=false&page=1&unclassified=false&utm_campaign=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_source=scholar.google.com), both supportive, but not really granular, and not really true to the claims of Cole :/

- The [thread on legibility](core of first half of paper is review of a bunch of prior studies, which basically provide no/negative evidence that there's systematic variation in consensus across fields that are thought to be at different levels of the [[hierarchy of the sciences]]: [[[[CLM]] - There is no systematic variation in consensus across fields on judging quality of contributions to research frontiers - [[@coleHierarchySciences1983]]]]) from [[@coleHierarchySciences1983]] seems fundamental. Many threads run through the question of how to assess ideas.

    - And it connects to the synthesis stuff insofar as legibility is helped by (effective, malleable vs. calcified, shallow) synthesis

    - Project on problem formulation (and how to properly specify an objective function for a possible language model)

    - Also the stuff with Matt.

    - And of course AJ's stuff with bridging analogies (which has an idea of ranking).

- same hypothesized ordering here as in [[@coleHierarchySciences1983]] and [[@simontonVarietiesScientificCreativity2009]], from physics to biology to social science

    - Really need to trace this forward, see whether there are any better signals today with better methods. To their credit, Cole et al were quite upfront about methodological limitations.
