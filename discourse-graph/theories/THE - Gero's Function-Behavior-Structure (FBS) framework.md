- originally proposed in [[@geroDesignPrototypesKnowledge1990]]
- extended in [[@geroSituatedFunctionbehaviourstructureFramework2004]]
- variant is [[[[THE]] - Goel's Structure-Behavior-Function (SBF) model]]

- edit Sketches - building on the idea of [bridging as the primary purpose of the theory](((ltZXeij2S))), i like the idea of framing in terms of [[[[THE]] - Gero's Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) framework]], where function = cognitive mechanisms, behavior = affordances / interactions, and structure = interface designs

- another thing i wonder about as a frame for breaking this down: [[[[THE]] - Gero's Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) framework]]

    - prompts and guides as behaviors

    - complexity and common ground as functions
