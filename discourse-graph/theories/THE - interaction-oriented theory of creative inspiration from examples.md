    - ## Overview

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FOJF6WQMbIr.png?alt=media&token=5ee46a0b-ccd5-48b1-a684-e363dc7d6130)

        - Figure X shows an overview of our framework. From the literature, we synthesize four levels of functional outcomes of examples that can lead to creative inspiration: in ascending order of sophistication, these are 1) priming, 2) repurposing, 3) combination and integration, and 4) modeling. These levels of functional outcomes are then mapped to four key behaviors of working with examples: 1) viewing, 2) analyzing, 3) comparing, and 4) contextualizing. The intuition behind this mapping is that each of these behaviors "unlocks" a particular level of functional outcome: for example, enabling analysis behavior unlocks the functional outcome of repurposing (simply viewing is insufficient), and enabling comparison behaviors unlocks the functional outcomes of combination and integration.

        - We first describe each of these functional outcomes, discussing their grounding in the literature. Next, we describe the behaviors, and their mapping to functional outcomes. We then describe examples of interfaces (structures) that support different combinations of these behaviors. Finally, we demonstrate how the framework generates predictions for the functional outcomes of those interfaces w.r.t. the use of examples and their impact on ideation.

    - ## Levels of functional outcomes from examples

        - Let's first consider the key functional outcomes of examples for creative ideation: in other words, what we expect to happen from a specific creative cognition perspective, rather than interface-oriented behaviors.

        - ### Stimulate: [[CLM - Examples can improve creative outcomes by stimulating more exploration away from obvious starting points]]

            - The most basic functional outcome is that examples can directly shape ideation by providing features or conceptual elements to use, or priming a direction of thinking:

            - Most basic result is that features get transferred over directly from examples. This happens whether we want it to or not. It's called [[cryptomnesia]]

                - [[EVD - Undergrads' drawings of imaginary animals frequently included typical features from earth animals, with occasional deviations - @wardStructuredImaginationRole1994]]

                - [[EVD - design students transferred flawed features from an example even though the flaws were described as negative - @janssonDesignFixation1991]]

                    - a few other problems, and [also for professionals]([Professional structural design engineers](((ThoPyJe5b))) who [were shown an example](((XNP7iOLs5))) (flawed, but flaws not stated) design for a disposable coffee cup were approximately 2X more likely to include key features from the example design in [their own brainstormed designs](((vlqhHRHsI))), compared to engineers who didn't see the example; both sets of engineers generated similar numbers of total design ideas) (though not domain experts; structural design doing product design)

            - The other basic result is that examples' features can shape ideation by shaping what other ideas are available, through [[spreading activation]]

                - Spreading activation is a known and influential model of how memory works

                    - Ideas are constructed, at least partially, from information in memory

                    - Priming is a means for influencing activation (see, e.g., [[@mcnamaraPrimingConstraintsIt1992]]

                        - An example

                        - Whether this happens at a more abstract level with social priming is still an open question. However, semantic priming at a cognitive level is well established.

                - Original canonical cite for spreading activation is [[@collinsSpreadingactivationTheorySemantic1975]]

                - Some quibbles about the details of the model (e.g., [[@ratcliffDoesActivationReally1981]]

                - This chain of thinking is the basic prediction of [[THE - Search in Associative Memory (SIAM)]]

                - Empirical stuff:

                    - More ideas alone after seeing idea from others

                        - also cc [[CL - Alternating individual and group ideation is better for group creative work than individual or group work alone]]

            - Finally, examples can set "benchmarks" maybe??

            - Here, the observables are high similarity between the example and the idea that it inspires. This isn't necessarily a bad thing!

            - I think it's clear that this level of functional outcome is the riskiest! You gotta get lucky with a feature to transfer or adapt to your setting!

            - note: people can still do more with examples than just view them, esp. if they're experts! that's what we see often with the expert designers. but affordances for analysis, like [product dissection](Thinking of product dissection stuff from [[@tohImpactExampleModality2014]]

        - ### Repurpose

            - A second outcome --- repurposing --- is similar to stimulating, but goes a step further: rather than transferring all or most of the elements of an example, this outcome involves taking particular elements from the example and using it in a new idea in a way that departs significantly from the example.

            - A slightly more sophisticated functional outcome of examples is adapting the example in a more distant way, rather than directly using most or all of the idea directly.

            - One way this happens is by [breaking an example down into its component parts]([[CLM - Breaking ideas down into component parts facilitates creative reinterpretation]]

                - In insight problem solving, we have the notion of [[chunk decomposition]]

                    - [[EVD - People were ~2x worse at solving matchstick arithmetic problems when the elements were harder to decompose into chunks - @knoblichConstraintRelaxationChunk1999]]

                    - {{embed: Impeding [[chunk decomposition]]

                - Eckert also observed professional designers doing analysis of a source of inspiration to repurpose their solution elements in nontrivial and surprising ways

                    - [[EVD - designers used a range of strategies for working with sources of inspiration, ranging from si...ore associated with radical transformation of sources - @eckertAdaptationSourcesInspiration2003]]

            - [[analogy]]

                - this is the [[schema-driven analogizing]]

                - and the many experiments by gick et al that try to pair the concrete source analogy example of the generals for  [[Duncker's radiation problem]]

                    - not encouraging though: [[@gickSchemaInductionAnalogical1983]]

                    - though i think clement has some stuff on this later that's more encouraging? see, e.g, this one on "manifest" analogs (making the relations explicit): [[@clementEffectStructuralEmbedding1994]]

            - Related is abstraction, thinking of goals or principles.

                - Example: [[EVD - College students imagined novel alien creatures with more atypical features vs. Earth creatur...fe forms, vs. building on specific Earth animal exemplars - @wardRoleSpecificityAbstraction2004]]

                - I wonder if this explains why we sometimes see exemplar + principle being more powerful than exemplar or principle alone

            - [[THE - Geneplore model]]

                - cc [[CLM - The notion of an 'idea' is very complicated]]

            - Examples of this include...

            - The lit on this includes...

        - ### Integrate: [[CLM - diverse examples improve creative outcomes by enabling novel conceptual integrations]]

            - The next functional outcome of integrating builds on the previous ones: rather than transferring or repurposing elements from a single example, ^^this outcome^^ . Sometimes this combination leads to a new whole that is greater than the sum of its parts, with [[emergent properties]]

            - the whole thing with fixation in insight problem solving is needing to see them as more/less than what they are! maier's two string problem, gotta see the strings as pendulums, not just things to tie with, and [[Duncker's candle problem]]

                - [[EVD - Design students generated more creative web service ideas when combining interdomain web service examples, compared to intradomain examples - @zengFosteringCreativityProduct2011]]

                - [[EVD - designers used examples by re-appropriating and recombining solution components into novel ideas - @herringGettingInspiredUnderstanding2009]]

                - [[EVD - undergraduates used more complex integration approaches (vs. property transfer and hybridizat...n phrases from dissimilar vs. similar noun pairs - @wilkenfeldSimilarityEmergenceConceptual2001]]

                - [[EVD - undergraduates generated novel word combination noun phrases with more emergent features when noun pairs were dissimilar vs. similar - @wilkenfeldSimilarityEmergenceConceptual2001]]

        - ### Model: [[CLM - examples can improve creative outcomes by enabling more robust (re)modeling of the problem space]]

            - Finally, we have the functional outcome of modeling. Here, there is a greater distance between the specific features of examples and what ideas result: rather than serving as stimulation, or sources of specific features to transfer or recombine, the examples are used to induce a higher level model of one or more relevant design spaces, problem formulations, or frames, which then guides exploration.

            - The core idea here is that the examples here are used for more than solution elements; they interact in intricate ways with the designers' formulation, or model, of the problem. They are used to get a higher level sense of promising directions, the shape of the space, and sometimes even to trigger and support reformulation of the problem itself.

            - Examples of this include...

            - But there is also concepts and evidence along the lines of [[THE - Cognitive Flexibility Theory (CFT)]]

                - Certain kinds of experiences (unstructured, self-directed, contextualized) lead to representations that are more conceptually flexible, and can be applied in new ways

    - ## Behaviors for working with examples

        - Let's now consider how the aforementioned functional outcomes might map to specific observable behaviors that are closer to the way that designers reason about the effects of their interfaces.

        - ### View

            - Viewing diverse inputs such as examples and information could intrigue designers to explore broader design spaces other than over-relying on at-hand examples and getting fixated too early [[@leeDesigningInteractiveExample2010]]

        - ### Analyze

        - ### Compare

            - Comparing the visualization of distance of idea examples to a simple list of examples, users in the Viz condition leveraged both semantic and categorical similarity, curated a more similar set of examples, and adopted more language from examples into their iterated ideas (without negatively affecting the overall novelty).

        - stimulation mostly --> quant, inconsistently with creativity/novelty/quality (depends on type of example often), pretty consistently lowers variety

In this paper, we present a mathematical model that mimics the idea of how fixation can occur at the meta-representation level. In this model, new abstract concepts derived from the meta-representation are not simple combinations of the design ideas expressed in the primary representation. Instead, the process of meta-representation corresponds to the abstraction of new features at a higher, hierarchically separated level of representation from an existing one. We show a computational process of ^^pattern extraction from existing design representations that results in the crystallization of design ideas or ‘chunks’ at an abstract level^^. The relation between the representation and its referent is explicitly described in these ‘chunks’, yet the ‘chunks’ have different properties from the properties of the original representation.
