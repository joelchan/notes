        - Figure X shows an overview of our framework. From the literature, we synthesize four levels of functional outcomes of examples that can lead to creative inspiration: in ascending order of sophistication, these are 1) priming, 2) repurposing, 3) combination and integration, and 4) modeling. These levels of functional outcomes are then mapped to four key behaviors of working with examples: 1) viewing, 2) analyzing, 3) comparing, and 4) contextualizing. The intuition behind this mapping is that each of these behaviors "unlocks" a particular level of functional outcome: for example, enabling analysis behavior unlocks the functional outcome of repurposing (simply viewing is insufficient), and enabling comparison behaviors unlocks the functional outcomes of combination and integration.

        - We first describe each of these functional outcomes, discussing their grounding in the literature. Next, we describe the behaviors, and their mapping to functional outcomes. We then describe examples of interfaces (structures) that support different combinations of these behaviors. Finally, we demonstrate how the framework generates predictions for the functional outcomes of those interfaces w.r.t. the use of examples and their impact on ideation.

    - ## Levels of functional outcomes from examples

        - Let's first consider the key functional outcomes of examples for creative ideation: in other words, what we expect to happen from a specific creative cognition perspective, rather than interface-oriented behaviors.

        - ### Stimulate: [[[[CLM]] - Examples can improve creative outcomes by stimulating more exploration away from obvious starting points]]

            - The most basic functional outcome is that examples can directly shape ideation by providing features or conceptual elements to use, or priming a direction of thinking:

            - Most basic result is that features get transferred over directly from examples. This happens whether we want it to or not. It's called [[cryptomnesia]], [[ðŸ§± fixation]], [[conformity effect]], and [[structured imagination]] in psych studies.

                - [[[[EVD]] - Undergrads' drawings of imaginary animals frequently included typical features from earth animals, with occasional deviations - [[@wardStructuredImaginationRole1994]]]]

                - [[[[EVD]] - design students transferred flawed features from an example even though the flaws were described as negative - [[@janssonDesignFixation1991]]]]

                    - a few other problems, and [also for professionals]([Professional structural design engineers](((ThoPyJe5b))) who [were shown an example](((XNP7iOLs5))) (flawed, but flaws not stated) design for a disposable coffee cup were approximately 2X more likely to include key features from the example design in [their own brainstormed designs](((vlqhHRHsI))), compared to engineers who didn't see the example; both sets of engineers generated similar numbers of total design ideas) (though not domain experts; structural design doing product design)

            - The other basic result is that examples' features can shape ideation by shaping what other ideas are available, through [[spreading activation]] and [[priming]]

                - Spreading activation is a known and influential model of how memory works

                    - Ideas are constructed, at least partially, from information in memory

                    - Priming is a means for influencing activation (see, e.g., [[@mcnamaraPrimingConstraintsIt1992]])

                        - An example

                        - Whether this happens at a more abstract level with social priming is still an open question. However, semantic priming at a cognitive level is well established.

                - Original canonical cite for spreading activation is [[@collinsSpreadingactivationTheorySemantic1975]]

                - Some quibbles about the details of the model (e.g., [[@ratcliffDoesActivationReally1981]]), but the basic idea that "things you see will shape what else you think of" is quite robust

                - This chain of thinking is the basic prediction of [[[[THE]] - Search in Associative Memory (SIAM)]] from [[@nijstadHowGroupAffects2006]]: they're trying to explain how group ideation works, and under what conditions it can be better than individual ideation. Here we can think of ideas from others as "examples"; the basic notion here is that ideas from others act as "cues" to shape what the activated set of associated memories is.

                - Empirical stuff:

                    - More ideas alone after seeing idea from others

                        - also cc [[[[CL]] - Alternating individual and group ideation is better for group creative work than individual or group work alone]]

            - Finally, examples can set "benchmarks" maybe??

            - Here, the observables are high similarity between the example and the idea that it inspires. This isn't necessarily a bad thing!

            - I think it's clear that this level of functional outcome is the riskiest! You gotta get lucky with a feature to transfer or adapt to your setting!

            - note: people can still do more with examples than just view them, esp. if they're experts! that's what we see often with the expert designers. but affordances for analysis, like [product dissection](Thinking of product dissection stuff from [[@tohImpactExampleModality2014]]), or tools/worklfows like [[obscure features]]

        - ### Repurpose

            - A second outcome --- repurposing --- is similar to stimulating, but goes a step further: rather than transferring all or most of the elements of an example, this outcome involves taking particular elements from the example and using it in a new idea in a way that departs significantly from the example.

            - A slightly more sophisticated functional outcome of examples is adapting the example in a more distant way, rather than directly using most or all of the idea directly.

            - One way this happens is by [breaking an example down into its component parts]([[[[CLM]] - Breaking ideas down into component parts facilitates creative reinterpretation]]), whether obvious or not

                - In insight problem solving, we have the notion of [[chunk decomposition]], which is especially powerful when the constituent chunks don't have an obvious meaning on their own. For example,

                    - [[[[EVD]] - People were ~2x worse at solving matchstick arithmetic problems when the elements were harder to decompose into chunks - [[@knoblichConstraintRelaxationChunk1999]]]]

                    - {{embed: Impeding [[chunk decomposition]] makes it harder to overcome [[Impasses]] during [[Insight problem solving]]}}

                - Eckert also observed professional designers doing analysis of a source of inspiration to repurpose their solution elements in nontrivial and surprising ways

                    - [[[[EVD]] - designers used a range of strategies for working with sources of inspiration, ranging from simpler, more source-driven strategies like direct source adaptation, to more complex and reflective strategies like source analysis and schema-driven source selection; complex strategies were more likely to be used by professionals and also more associated with radical transformation of sources - [[@eckertAdaptationSourcesInspiration2003]]]]

            - [[analogy]]: bunch of stuff on analogical transfer - basically if you re-represent ideas in more abstract or schematic ways, then it's easier to adapt it to another setting

                - this is the [[schema-driven analogizing]] stuff again from naturalistic studies

                - and the many experiments by gick et al that try to pair the concrete source analogy example of the generals for  [[Duncker's radiation problem]] with various things that try to highlight the underlying schema

                    - not encouraging though: [[@gickSchemaInductionAnalogical1983]] has failures of presenting [principle](No advantage of principle over just analog, whether presented with analog or alone) or [diagram](((Q9SmOi4Nv))) with analog

                    - though i think clement has some stuff on this later that's more encouraging? see, e.g, this one on "manifest" analogs (making the relations explicit): [[@clementEffectStructuralEmbedding1994]]

            - Related is abstraction, thinking of goals or principles.

                - Example: [[[[EVD]] - College students imagined novel alien creatures with more atypical features vs. Earth creatures when they were instructed to consider survival-critical features of life forms, vs. building on specific Earth animal exemplars - [[@wardRoleSpecificityAbstraction2004]]]]

                - I wonder if this explains why we sometimes see exemplar + principle being more powerful than exemplar or principle alone

            - [[[[THE]] - Geneplore model]] talks about how people generate "preinventive structures" first (their version of ideas, not exactly sure ), and then creatively explore their emergent properties to construct new ideas; this latter part of not just taking the ^^p^^

                - cc [[[[CLM]] - The notion of an 'idea' is very complicated]]

            - Is [[Reflection-in-Action]] related?

            - Examples of this include...

            - The lit on this includes...

        - ### Integrate: [[[[CLM]] - diverse examples improve creative outcomes by enabling novel conceptual integrations]]

            - The next functional outcome of integrating builds on the previous ones: rather than transferring or repurposing elements from a single example, ^^this outcome^^ . Sometimes this combination leads to a new whole that is greater than the sum of its parts, with [[emergent properties]].

            - the whole thing with fixation in insight problem solving is needing to see them as more/less than what they are! maier's two string problem, gotta see the strings as pendulums, not just things to tie with, and [[Duncker's candle problem]], and the whole [[chunk decomposition]] thing (they're not numerals, they're matches!)

            - Examples of this include...

            - The lit on this includes...

            - [[SupportedBy]]

                - [[[[EVD]] - Design students generated more creative web service ideas when combining interdomain web service examples, compared to intradomain examples - [[@zengFosteringCreativityProduct2011]]]]

                - [[[[EVD]] - designers used examples by re-appropriating and recombining solution components into novel ideas - [[@herringGettingInspiredUnderstanding2009]]]]

                - [[[[EVD]] - undergraduates used more complex integration approaches (vs. property transfer and hybridization approaches) when generating definitions for noun phrases from dissimilar vs. similar noun pairs - [[@wilkenfeldSimilarityEmergenceConceptual2001]]]]

                - [[[[EVD]] - undergraduates generated novel word combination noun phrases with more emergent features when noun pairs were dissimilar vs. similar - [[@wilkenfeldSimilarityEmergenceConceptual2001]]]]

        - ### Model: [[[[CLM]] - examples can improve creative outcomes by enabling more robust (re)modeling of the problem space]]

            - Finally, we have the functional outcome of modeling. Here, there is a greater distance between the specific features of examples and what ideas result: rather than serving as stimulation, or sources of specific features to transfer or recombine, the examples are used to induce a higher level model of one or more relevant design spaces, problem formulations, or frames, which then guides exploration.

            - The core idea here is that the examples here are used for more than solution elements; they interact in intricate ways with the designers' formulation, or model, of the problem. They are used to get a higher level sense of promising directions, the shape of the space, and sometimes even to trigger and support reformulation of the problem itself.

            - Examples of this include...

            - The [lit on this]([[SupportedBy]]) comes moreso from research in a more qualitative and ethnographic tradition, rather than experimental, focusing on developing theory from __in situ__ observations of creative practice with examples.

                - [[[[EVD]] - designers used examples to shape their understanding of the problem before generating solutions - [[@herringGettingInspiredUnderstanding2009]]]]

                - [[[[EVD]] - professional designers curated examples to understand trends and design approaches to inform their design, vs. simple direct transfer of solution approaches - [[@sharminUnderstandingKnowledgeManagement2009b]]]]

                - [[[[EVD]] - Two artists used individual artworks to shape not just their ideas, but used a process of "analogical modification" to search for and modify higher-order concepts, and their creative vision. This process unfolded over the course of years. - [[@okadaAnalogicalModificationCreation2009]]]]

                - [[[[EVD]] - Engineering design students used multiple cross-domain analogies to fulfill design needs, and they could use analogies to get inspiration of how to decompose the problem and find new analogies. - [[@helmsCompoundAnalogicalDesign2008]]]]

            - But there is also concepts and evidence along the lines of [[[[THE]] - Cognitive Flexibility Theory (CFT)]] that, on first blush, does not seem to be directly related to creativity support tools, but shares a deep underlying connection.

                - Certain kinds of experiences (unstructured, self-directed, contextualized) lead to representations that are more conceptually flexible, and can be applied in new ways

                    - [[[[EVD]] - higher conceptual flexibility to classify organisms based on taxonomic and ecological relations if children were older, from more rural areas, and engaged in more unstructured interactions with organisms - [[@betzDevelopmentConceptualFlexibility2020]]]]

                    - [[[[EVD]] - overall salience of taxonomic relations for organizing living things for 6-12 year old children - [[@betzDevelopmentConceptualFlexibility2020]]]]

    - ## Behaviors for working with examples

        - Let's now consider how the aforementioned functional outcomes might map to specific observable behaviors that are closer to the way that designers reason about the effects of their interfaces.

        - ### View

            - Viewing diverse inputs such as examples and information could intrigue designers to explore broader design spaces other than over-relying on at-hand examples and getting fixated too early [[@leeDesigningInteractiveExample2010]]

        - ### Analyze

        - ### Compare

            - rationale: easier to cross-compare if you can see both at once (basic logic?)

                - but there is some evidence on this from @richlandCognitiveSupportsAnalogies2007 re: [visuospatial support for analogical mapping]([[[[EVD]] - teachers in countries with high math and science achievement scores also displayed more cognitive supports for analogies, such as bridging analogies, and visuospatial scaffolds for comparison, compared to teachers in a country with lower math and science achievement - [[@richlandCognitiveSupportsAnalogies2007]]]])

        - ### (re)Contextualize

            - [[[[EVD]] - Designers reported that visual juxtaposition of often contradictory themes, in the context of a coherent whole, on mood boards was essential for productively reframing the design problem - [[@luceroFramingAligningParadoxing2012]]]]

            - Comparing the visualization of distance of idea examples to a simple list of examples, users in the Viz condition leveraged both semantic and categorical similarity, curated a more similar set of examples, and adopted more language from examples into their iterated ideas (without negatively affecting the overall novelty). [[@xuIdeateRelateExamplesGallery2021]]

            - i don't know of many ~~there aren't a lot of~~ examples of interfaces for (re)contextualizing - requires a model of ideas! trying to get there though! see [[Stephen MacNeil]]'s stuff, for example, or [[@siangliulueCollaborativeIdeationScale2015]]

                - update [[June 30th, 2022]]: there's a pretty good thread of such interfaces in domains with good world models, like visual design; see [here](systems that kind of get at this [contextualizing](((rANFip5zr))) thingy; cc [[Jason Ding]])

            - goal-directed/integrated interactions with examples can facilitate problem reformulation

                - suggestive [evidence]([[SupportedBy]]) from studies of how experiences impact semantic organization

                    - [[[[EVD]] - higher conceptual flexibility to classify organisms based on taxonomic and ecological relations if children were older, from more rural areas, and engaged in more unstructured interactions with organisms - [[@betzDevelopmentConceptualFlexibility2020]]]]

                    - [[[[EVD]] - estimated semantic networks of animal concepts from montessori-educated children were more interconnected, with shorter paths between concepts and fewer subcommunities, compared to networks from traditional-schooled but comparable children - [[@denervaudEducationShapesStructure2021]]]]

    - Timing?

    - nuances in the relationship with outcomes?

        - stimulation mostly --> quant, inconsistently with creativity/novelty/quality (depends on type of example often), pretty consistently lowers variety

        - repurpose helps with creativity/novelty/quality

            - [transfer as fixation](Most basic result is that features get transferred over directly from examples. This happens whether we want it to or not. It's called [[cryptomnesia]], [[ðŸ§± fixation]], [[conformity effect]], and [[structured imagination]] in psych studies.)

The effect was found with immediate testing (Experiments 1) and delayed testing (Experiment 2). The effect was also found with arbitrary features (Experiments 1-4), as well as with naturally occurring orthographic regularities (Experiment 4). Participants had difficulty avoiding the use of this prior knowledge, despite being able to list the features they were asked to avoid (Experiment 3). The results are discussed in terms of the inadvertent use of prior knowledge in generative cognitive tasks.)

                    - [[@dowCheatersNeverProsper2015]] classic [[cryptomnesia]], stronger for novices, magnified by cognitive load (from [abstract](Abstract:: Previous work has shown that the presence of examples may lead to cryptomnesia, or inadvertent plagiarism, on creative tasks. Various experiential and environmental attributes may magnify this finding. For instance, novices, with limited knowledge, may be more prone to inadvertently plagiarize examples, and increases in cognitive load may result in an inability to recall the source of an idea. The purpose of my research was to determine if providing examples leads to cryptomnesia on linguistic and visual creative tasks and to further examine whether expertise level and cognitive load magnifies this relationship. In study 1, participants were given plain instructions or instructions with either an auditory or print example before completing linguistic and visual divergent thinking (DT) tasks. Examples increased the likelihood of cryptomnesia for both tasks, especially with congruent modalities (print example and visual task). In study 2, participants were classified as novices or experts in engineering and completed two designs tasks, one with an example accompanying the instructions. ^^The presence of an example fostered cryptomnesia and this effect was stronger for novices. Novices were also more likely to inadvertently self-plagiarize^^. In study 3, participants were exposed to examples under both cognitive taxation and no taxation conditions prior to completing linguistic and visual DT tasks. After controlling for error rate on taxation task, ^^cognitive taxation resulted in a greater likelihood of cryptomnesia^^. Based on principles of schema theory and cognitive load, in order to reduce cryptomnesia it is recommended to avoid providing examples for higher level learning objectives and avoid simultaneous presentation of congruent task modalities.))

In all three experiments, the ^^designs of subjects who had seen the examples were more likely to contain features of the examples^^. This [[conformity effect]] did not significantly decrease in Experiment 2, when a 23-min task was interpolated between viewing the examples and generating related ideas. The hypothesis that the observed conformity effects may have been caused by subjects' assumptions that they should try to generate ideas similar to the examples was refuted in Experiment 3; explicitly instructing subjects to create ideas that were very different from the examples did not decrease conformity to the examples, and instructing them to conform to the examples significantly increased conformity. The results show that recent experience can lead to unintentional conformity, constraining the generation of creative ideas.) in [[creature invention task]], despite instructions to avoid

Conformity was observed in all three experiments; participants tended to incorporate critical features of experimenter-provided examples. However, ^^examination of total output, elaborateness of design, and the noncritical features did not confirm that the conformity effect constrained creative output in any of the three experiments^^. Increasing the number of examples increased the conformity effect (Experiment 1). Examples that covaried features that are naturally uncorrelated in the real world led to a greater subjective rating of creativity (Experiment 2). A delay between presentation and test increased conformity (Experiment 3), just as models of inadvertent plagiarism would predict. The explanatory power of theoretical accounts such as activation, retrieval blocking, structured imagination, and category abstraction are evaluated.)

Although creativity-relevant generative processes are stimulated by collaborative activity, this does not necessarily mean that collaboration results in a more creative product. "))

            - [[@okadaImitationInspirationCreation2017]] copying and deeply engaging with unfamiliar artworks facilitates creativity in drawing; hypothesized mechanism is restructuring of cognitive constraints, sounds like analysis ([abstract](Abstract:: To investigate the cognitive processes underlying creative inspiration, we tested the extent to which viewing or copying prior examples impacted creative output in art. In Experiment 1, undergraduates made drawings under three conditions: (a) copying an artist's drawing, then producing an original drawing; (b) producing an original drawing without having seen another's work; and (c) copying another artist's work, then reproducing that artist's style independently. We discovered that through copying unfamiliar abstract drawings, participants were able to produce creative drawings qualitatively different from the model drawings. Process analyses suggested that participants' cognitive constraints became relaxed, and new perspectives were formed from copying another's artwork. Experiment 2 showed that ^^exposure to styles of artwork considered unfamiliar facilitated creativity in drawing, while styles considered familiar did not do so^^. Experiment 3 showed that both ^^copying and thoroughly viewing artwork executed using an unfamiliar style facilitated creativity in drawing, whereas merely thinking about alternative styles of artistic representation did not do so^^. These experiments revealed that ^^deep encounters with unfamiliar artworksâ€”whether through copying or prolonged observationâ€”change people's cognitive representations of the act of drawing to produce novel artwork^^.))

                    - > This paper argues that design fixation, in part, entails fixation at the level of meta-representation, the representation of the relation between a representation and its reference. In this paper, we present a mathematical model that mimics the idea of how fixation can occur at the meta-representation level. In this model, new abstract concepts derived from the meta-representation are not simple combinations of the design ideas expressed in the primary representation. Instead, the process of meta-representation corresponds to the abstraction of new features at a higher, hierarchically separated level of representation from an existing one. We show a computational process of ^^pattern extraction from existing design representations that results in the crystallization of design ideas or â€˜chunksâ€™ at an abstract level^^. The relation between the representation and its referent is explicitly described in these â€˜chunksâ€™, yet the â€˜chunksâ€™ have different properties from the properties of the original representation.
