        - Figure X shows an overview of our framework. From the literature, we synthesize four levels of functional outcomes of examples that can lead to creative inspiration: in ascending order of sophistication, these are 1) priming, 2) repurposing, 3) combination and integration, and 4) modeling. These levels of functional outcomes are then mapped to four key behaviors of working with examples: 1) viewing, 2) analyzing, 3) comparing, and 4) contextualizing. The intuition behind this mapping is that each of these behaviors "unlocks" a particular level of functional outcome: for example, enabling analysis behavior unlocks the functional outcome of repurposing (simply viewing is insufficient), and enabling comparison behaviors unlocks the functional outcomes of combination and integration.

        - We first describe each of these functional outcomes, discussing their grounding in the literature. Next, we describe the behaviors, and their mapping to functional outcomes. We then describe examples of interfaces (structures) that support different combinations of these behaviors. Finally, we demonstrate how the framework generates predictions for the functional outcomes of those interfaces w.r.t. the use of examples and their impact on ideation.

    - ## Levels of functional outcomes from examples

        - Let's first consider the key functional outcomes of examples for creative ideation: in other words, what we expect to happen from a specific creative cognition perspective, rather than interface-oriented behaviors.

        - ### Stimulate: [[[[CLM]] - Examples can improve creative outcomes by stimulating more exploration away from obvious starting points]]

            - The most basic functional outcome is that examples can directly shape ideation by providing features or conceptual elements to use, or priming a direction of thinking:

            - Most basic result is that features get transferred over directly from examples. This happens whether we want it to or not. It's called [[cryptomnesia]], [[ðŸ§± fixation]], [[conformity effect]], and [[structured imagination]] in psych studies.

                - [[[[EVD]] - Undergrads' drawings of imaginary animals frequently included typical features from earth animals, with occasional deviations - [[@wardStructuredImaginationRole1994]]]]

                - [[[[EVD]] - design students transferred flawed features from an example even though the flaws were described as negative - [[@janssonDesignFixation1991]]]]

                    - a few other problems, and [also for professionals]([Professional structural design engineers](((ThoPyJe5b))) who [were shown an example](((XNP7iOLs5))) (flawed, but flaws not stated) design for a disposable coffee cup were approximately 2X more likely to include key features from the example design in [their own brainstormed designs](((vlqhHRHsI))), compared to engineers who didn't see the example; both sets of engineers generated similar numbers of total design ideas) (though not domain experts; structural design doing product design)

            - The other basic result is that examples' features can shape ideation by shaping what other ideas are available, through [[spreading activation]] and [[priming]]

                - Spreading activation is a known and influential model of how memory works

                    - Ideas are constructed, at least partially, from information in memory

                    - Priming is a means for influencing activation (see, e.g., [[@mcnamaraPrimingConstraintsIt1992]])

                        - An example

                        - Whether this happens at a more abstract level with social priming is still an open question. However, semantic priming at a cognitive level is well established.

                - Original canonical cite for spreading activation is [[@collinsSpreadingactivationTheorySemantic1975]]

                - Some quibbles about the details of the model (e.g., [[@ratcliffDoesActivationReally1981]]), but the basic idea that "things you see will shape what else you think of" is quite robust

                - This chain of thinking is the basic prediction of [[[[THE]] - Search in Associative Memory (SIAM)]] from [[@nijstadHowGroupAffects2006]]: they're trying to explain how group ideation works, and under what conditions it can be better than individual ideation. Here we can think of ideas from others as "examples"; the basic notion here is that ideas from others act as "cues" to shape what the activated set of associated memories is.

                - Empirical stuff:

                    - More ideas alone after seeing idea from others

                        - also cc [[[[CL]] - Alternating individual and group ideation is better for group creative work than individual or group work alone]]

            - Finally, examples can set "benchmarks" maybe??

            - Here, the observables are high similarity between the example and the idea that it inspires. This isn't necessarily a bad thing!

            - I think it's clear that this level of functional outcome is the riskiest! You gotta get lucky with a feature to transfer or adapt to your setting!

            - note: people can still do more with examples than just view them, esp. if they're experts! that's what we see often with the expert designers. but affordances for analysis, like [product dissection](Thinking of product dissection stuff from [[@tohImpactExampleModality2014]]), or tools/worklfows like [[obscure features]]

        - ### Repurpose

            - A second outcome --- repurposing --- is similar to stimulating, but goes a step further: rather than transferring all or most of the elements of an example, this outcome involves taking particular elements from the example and using it in a new idea in a way that departs significantly from the example.

            - A slightly more sophisticated functional outcome of examples is adapting the example in a more distant way, rather than directly using most or all of the idea directly.

            - One way this happens is by [breaking an example down into its component parts]([[[[CLM]] - Breaking ideas down into component parts facilitates creative reinterpretation]]), whether obvious or not

                - In insight problem solving, we have the notion of [[chunk decomposition]], which is especially powerful when the constituent chunks don't have an obvious meaning on their own. For example,

                    - [[[[EVD]] - People were ~2x worse at solving matchstick arithmetic problems when the elements were harder to decompose into chunks - [[@knoblichConstraintRelaxationChunk1999]]]]

                    - {{embed: Impeding [[chunk decomposition]] makes it harder to overcome [[Impasses]] during [[Insight problem solving]]}}

                - Eckert also observed professional designers doing analysis of a source of inspiration to repurpose their solution elements in nontrivial and surprising ways

                    - [[[[EVD]] - designers used a range of strategies for working with sources of inspiration, ranging from simpler, more source-driven strategies like direct source adaptation, to more complex and reflective strategies like source analysis and schema-driven source selection; complex strategies were more likely to be used by professionals and also more associated with radical transformation of sources - [[@eckertAdaptationSourcesInspiration2003]]]]

            - [[analogy]]: bunch of stuff on analogical transfer - basically if you re-represent ideas in more abstract or schematic ways, then it's easier to adapt it to another setting

                - this is the [[schema-driven analogizing]] stuff again from naturalistic studies

                - and the many experiments by gick et al that try to pair the concrete source analogy example of the generals for  [[Duncker's radiation problem]] with various things that try to highlight the underlying schema

                    - not encouraging though: [[@gickSchemaInductionAnalogical1983]] has failures of presenting [principle](No advantage of principle over just analog, whether presented with analog or alone) or [diagram](((Q9SmOi4Nv))) with analog

                    - though i think clement has some stuff on this later that's more encouraging? see, e.g, this one on "manifest" analogs (making the relations explicit): [[@clementEffectStructuralEmbedding1994]]

            - Related is abstraction, thinking of goals or principles.

                - Example: [[[[EVD]] - College students imagined novel alien creatures with more atypical features vs. Earth creatures when they were instructed to consider survival-critical features of life forms, vs. building on specific Earth animal exemplars - [[@wardRoleSpecificityAbstraction2004]]]]

                - I wonder if this explains why we sometimes see exemplar + principle being more powerful than exemplar or principle alone

            - [[[[THE]] - Geneplore model]] talks about how people generate "preinventive structures" first (their version of ideas, not exactly sure ), and then creatively explore their emergent properties to construct new ideas; this latter part of not just taking the ^^p^^

                - cc [[[[CLM]] - The notion of an 'idea' is very complicated]]

            - Is [[Reflection-in-Action]] related?

            - Examples of this include...

            - The lit on this includes...

        - ### Integrate: [[[[CLM]] - diverse examples improve creative outcomes by enabling novel conceptual integrations]]

            - The next functional outcome of integrating builds on the previous ones: rather than transferring or repurposing elements from a single example, ^^this outcome^^ . Sometimes this combination leads to a new whole that is greater than the sum of its parts, with [[emergent properties]].

            - the whole thing with fixation in insight problem solving is needing to see them as more/less than what they are! maier's two string problem, gotta see the strings as pendulums, not just things to tie with, and [[Duncker's candle problem]], and the whole [[chunk decomposition]] thing (they're not numerals, they're matches!)

            - Examples of this include...

            - The lit on this includes...

            - [[SupportedBy]]

                - [[[[EVD]] - Design students generated more creative web service ideas when combining interdomain web service examples, compared to intradomain examples - [[@zengFosteringCreativityProduct2011]]]]

                - [[[[EVD]] - designers used examples by re-appropriating and recombining solution components into novel ideas - [[@herringGettingInspiredUnderstanding2009]]]]

                - [[[[EVD]] - undergraduates used more complex integration approaches (vs. property transfer and hybridization approaches) when generating definitions for noun phrases from dissimilar vs. similar noun pairs - [[@wilkenfeldSimilarityEmergenceConceptual2001]]]]

                - [[[[EVD]] - undergraduates generated novel word combination noun phrases with more emergent features when noun pairs were dissimilar vs. similar - [[@wilkenfeldSimilarityEmergenceConceptual2001]]]]

        - ### Model: [[[[CLM]] - examples can improve creative outcomes by enabling more robust (re)modeling of the problem space]]

            - Finally, we have the functional outcome of modeling. Here, there is a greater distance between the specific features of examples and what ideas result: rather than serving as stimulation, or sources of specific features to transfer or recombine, the examples are used to induce a higher level model of one or more relevant design spaces, problem formulations, or frames, which then guides exploration.

            - The core idea here is that the examples here are used for more than solution elements; they interact in intricate ways with the designers' formulation, or model, of the problem. They are used to get a higher level sense of promising directions, the shape of the space, and sometimes even to trigger and support reformulation of the problem itself.

            - Examples of this include...

            - The [lit on this]([[SupportedBy]]) comes moreso from research in a more qualitative and ethnographic tradition, rather than experimental, focusing on developing theory from __in situ__ observations of creative practice with examples.

                - [[[[EVD]] - designers used examples to shape their understanding of the problem before generating solutions - [[@herringGettingInspiredUnderstanding2009]]]]

                - [[[[EVD]] - professional designers curated examples to understand trends and design approaches to inform their design, vs. simple direct transfer of solution approaches - [[@sharminUnderstandingKnowledgeManagement2009b]]]]

                - [[[[EVD]] - Two artists used individual artworks to shape not just their ideas, but used a process of "analogical modification" to search for and modify higher-order concepts, and their creative vision. This process unfolded over the course of years. - [[@okadaAnalogicalModificationCreation2009]]]]

                - [[[[EVD]] - Engineering design students used multiple cross-domain analogies to fulfill design needs, and they could use analogies to get inspiration of how to decompose the problem and find new analogies. - [[@helmsCompoundAnalogicalDesign2008]]]]

            - But there is also concepts and evidence along the lines of [[[[THE]] - Cognitive Flexibility Theory (CFT)]] that, on first blush, does not seem to be directly related to creativity support tools, but shares a deep underlying connection.

                - Certain kinds of experiences (unstructured, self-directed, contextualized) lead to representations that are more conceptually flexible, and can be applied in new ways

                    - [[[[EVD]] - higher conceptual flexibility to classify organisms based on taxonomic and ecological relations if children were older, from more rural areas, and engaged in more unstructured interactions with organisms - [[@betzDevelopmentConceptualFlexibility2020]]]]

                    - [[[[EVD]] - overall salience of taxonomic relations for organizing living things for 6-12 year old children - [[@betzDevelopmentConceptualFlexibility2020]]]]

    - ## Behaviors for working with examples

        - Let's now consider how the aforementioned functional outcomes might map to specific observable behaviors that are closer to the way that designers reason about the effects of their interfaces.

        - ### View

            - Viewing diverse inputs such as examples and information could intrigue designers to explore broader design spaces other than over-relying on at-hand examples and getting fixated too early [[@leeDesigningInteractiveExample2010]]

        - ### Analyze

        - ### Compare

            - rationale: easier to cross-compare if you can see both at once (basic logic?)

                - but there is some evidence on this from @richlandCognitiveSupportsAnalogies2007 re: [visuospatial support for analogical mapping]([[[[EVD]] - teachers in countries with high math and science achievement scores also displayed more cognitive supports for analogies, such as bridging analogies, and visuospatial scaffolds for comparison, compared to teachers in a country with lower math and science achievement - [[@richlandCognitiveSupportsAnalogies2007]]]])

        - ### (re)Contextualize

            - [[[[EVD]] - Designers reported that visual juxtaposition of often contradictory themes, in the context of a coherent whole, on mood boards was essential for productively reframing the design problem - [[@luceroFramingAligningParadoxing2012]]]]

            - Comparing the visualization of distance of idea examples to a simple list of examples, users in the Viz condition leveraged both semantic and categorical similarity, curated a more similar set of examples, and adopted more language from examples into their iterated ideas (without negatively affecting the overall novelty). [[@xuIdeateRelateExamplesGallery2021]]

            - i don't know of many ~~there aren't a lot of~~ examples of interfaces for (re)contextualizing - requires a model of ideas! trying to get there though! see [[Stephen MacNeil]]'s stuff, for example, or [[@siangliulueCollaborativeIdeationScale2015]]

                - update [[June 30th, 2022]]: there's a pretty good thread of such interfaces in domains with good world models, like visual design; see [here](systems that kind of get at this [contextualizing](((rANFip5zr))) thingy; cc [[Jason Ding]])

            - goal-directed/integrated interactions with examples can facilitate problem reformulation

                - suggestive [evidence]([[SupportedBy]]) from studies of how experiences impact semantic organization

                    - [[[[EVD]] - higher conceptual flexibility to classify organisms based on taxonomic and ecological relations if children were older, from more rural areas, and engaged in more unstructured interactions with organisms - [[@betzDevelopmentConceptualFlexibility2020]]]]

                    - [[[[EVD]] - estimated semantic networks of animal concepts from montessori-educated children were more interconnected, with shorter paths between concepts and fewer subcommunities, compared to networks from traditional-schooled but comparable children - [[@denervaudEducationShapesStructure2021]]]]

    - Timing?

    - nuances in the relationship with outcomes?

        - stimulation mostly --> quant, inconsistently with creativity/novelty/quality (depends on type of example often), pretty consistently lowers variety

        - repurpose helps with creativity/novelty/quality

            - [transfer as fixation](Most basic result is that features get transferred over directly from examples. This happens whether we want it to or not. It's called [[cryptomnesia]], [[ðŸ§± fixation]], [[conformity effect]], and [[structured imagination]] in psych studies.)

The effect was found with immediate testing (Experiments 1) and delayed testing (Experiment 2). The effect was also found with arbitrary features (Experiments 1-4), as well as with naturally occurring orthographic regularities (Experiment 4). Participants had difficulty avoiding the use of this prior knowledge, despite being able to list the features they were asked to avoid (Experiment 3). The results are discussed in terms of the inadvertent use of prior knowledge in generative cognitive tasks.)

                    - [[@dowCheatersNeverProsper2015]] classic [[cryptomnesia]], stronger for novices, magnified by cognitive load (from [abstract](Abstract:: Previous work has shown that the presence of examples may lead to cryptomnesia, or inadvertent plagiarism, on creative tasks. Various experiential and environmental attributes may magnify this finding. For instance, novices, with limited knowledge, may be more prone to inadvertently plagiarize examples, and increases in cognitive load may result in an inability to recall the source of an idea. The purpose of my research was to determine if providing examples leads to cryptomnesia on linguistic and visual creative tasks and to further examine whether expertise level and cognitive load magnifies this relationship. In study 1, participants were given plain instructions or instructions with either an auditory or print example before completing linguistic and visual divergent thinking (DT) tasks. Examples increased the likelihood of cryptomnesia for both tasks, especially with congruent modalities (print example and visual task). In study 2, participants were classified as novices or experts in engineering and completed two designs tasks, one with an example accompanying the instructions. ^^The presence of an example fostered cryptomnesia and this effect was stronger for novices. Novices were also more likely to inadvertently self-plagiarize^^. In study 3, participants were exposed to examples under both cognitive taxation and no taxation conditions prior to completing linguistic and visual DT tasks. After controlling for error rate on taxation task, ^^cognitive taxation resulted in a greater likelihood of cryptomnesia^^. Based on principles of schema theory and cognitive load, in order to reduce cryptomnesia it is recommended to avoid providing examples for higher level learning objectives and avoid simultaneous presentation of congruent task modalities.))

In all three experiments, the ^^designs of subjects who had seen the examples were more likely to contain features of the examples^^. This [[conformity effect]] did not significantly decrease in Experiment 2, when a 23-min task was interpolated between viewing the examples and generating related ideas. The hypothesis that the observed conformity effects may have been caused by subjects' assumptions that they should try to generate ideas similar to the examples was refuted in Experiment 3; explicitly instructing subjects to create ideas that were very different from the examples did not decrease conformity to the examples, and instructing them to conform to the examples significantly increased conformity. The results show that recent experience can lead to unintentional conformity, constraining the generation of creative ideas.) in [[creature invention task]], despite instructions to avoid

Conformity was observed in all three experiments; participants tended to incorporate critical features of experimenter-provided examples. However, ^^examination of total output, elaborateness of design, and the noncritical features did not confirm that the conformity effect constrained creative output in any of the three experiments^^. Increasing the number of examples increased the conformity effect (Experiment 1). Examples that covaried features that are naturally uncorrelated in the real world led to a greater subjective rating of creativity (Experiment 2). A delay between presentation and test increased conformity (Experiment 3), just as models of inadvertent plagiarism would predict. The explanatory power of theoretical accounts such as activation, retrieval blocking, structured imagination, and category abstraction are evaluated.)

Although creativity-relevant generative processes are stimulated by collaborative activity, this does not necessarily mean that collaboration results in a more creative product. "))

In Experiment 1, undergraduates made drawings under three conditions: (a) copying an artist's drawing, then producing an original drawing; (b) producing an original drawing without having seen another's work; and (c) copying another artist's work, then reproducing that artist's style independently. We discovered that through copying unfamiliar abstract drawings, participants were able to produce creative drawings qualitatively different from the model drawings. Process analyses suggested that participants' cognitive constraints became relaxed, and new perspectives were formed from copying another's artwork. Experiment 2 showed that ^^exposure to styles of artwork considered unfamiliar facilitated creativity in drawing, while styles considered familiar did not do so^^. Experiment 3 showed that both ^^copying and thoroughly viewing artwork executed using an unfamiliar style facilitated creativity in drawing, whereas merely thinking about alternative styles of artistic representation did not do so^^. These experiments revealed that ^^deep encounters with unfamiliar artworksâ€”whether through copying or prolonged observationâ€”change people's cognitive representations of the act of drawing to produce novel artwork^^.))

                    - > This paper argues that design fixation, in part, entails fixation at the level of meta-representation, the representation of the relation between a representation and its reference. In this paper, we present a mathematical model that mimics the idea of how fixation can occur at the meta-representation level. In this model, new abstract concepts derived from the meta-representation are not simple combinations of the design ideas expressed in the primary representation. Instead, the process of meta-representation corresponds to the abstraction of new features at a higher, hierarchically separated level of representation from an existing one. We show a computational process of ^^pattern extraction from existing design representations that results in the crystallization of design ideas or â€˜chunksâ€™ at an abstract level^^. The relation between the representation and its referent is explicitly described in these â€˜chunksâ€™, yet the â€˜chunksâ€™ have different properties from the properties of the original representation.

- Revisiting [[[[CLM]] - examples can improve creative outcomes by enabling more robust (re)modeling of the problem space]] for [[[[THE]] - interaction-oriented theory of creative inspiration from examples]]

    - I would say that this hypothesis in the theory is definitely more uncertain than the previous ones, which have been well-studied, with various interventions tested for inducing them. This is why we need to test it!

    - The more interesting thing we can do from this is hypothesize what sorts of interfaces and interactions with examples would facilitate or hinder this modeling pathway.

        - There is a fuzzy hypothesis that we're testing with the [[[[EXP]] - [[D/Solution-Diversity]] - exploring presentation interaction effects on mechanism of inspiration from diverse examples]], in our comparisons: we can think of one dimension as (as [[Jason Ding]] writes) "^^greater or lesser distance from the problem representation^^". In the in-context interfaces, the examples are directly superimposed on the problem representation (which is a simple 2D grid with overlaid values). When we say "in-context", what do we mean? In context of what? I think we mean examples in context of the problem/solution space.

        - Extending this beyond our toy problem, what might this look like?

            - I'm thinking about the role of **curation**. See maybe [[@kerneStrategiesFreeFormWeb2017]], although... I don't love the distance between the students and design experts. But worth a look.

                - I think the part of this that is catching my interest is the distinction between classification/categorization and curation (where the latter is much more goal-oriented, particularly in the individual case). I expect to see "categories" and groupings and connections that are much more oriented to and aligned with idiosyncratic parts of the evolving model of the problem/solution space.

                - In curation interfaces, the distance between examples and model of the space approaches zero, similar to ours.

                - We might expect greater flexibility in problem formulations, then, for people who are able to curate examples in a much closer fashion.

            - I think it's interesting to think of "near misses", like tagging. Where the mechanics might constrain mapping to elements of the problem space, and nudge more towards categorization/classification. That is the BIG difference I experience between what I had with [[sys/Sente]] back during my PhD, and what we have now in Roam with the d/graph.

            - [[mood board]]s are similar. [[@kochSemanticCollageEnrichingDigital2020]] and [[@kochImageSenseIntelligentCollaborative2020]]

                - what is interesting about [[sys/SemanticCollage]] and [[sys/ImageSense]] I think is the ability of the designers to *define* the model of the example space, in conversation with their model of the "problem/solution space" (on the mood board)

                - in fact, [[AndrÃ©s Lucero]] (who is on these papers) also has a bunch of papers digging into this (found through this [[sys/ConnectedPapers]] [map](https://www.connectedpapers.com/main/dc90eab30d08907c810fd12ebe9723609f49a0cd/Understanding-knowledge-management-practices-for-early-design-activity-and-its-implications-for-reuse/graph) around [[@sharminUnderstandingKnowledgeManagement2009b]])

                - Although [[@goelStructureDesignProblem1992]] directly extended Simon's notion of problem spaces to thinking about design spaces

                - And there is a thread of work on trying to model what this space looks like.

            - As early back as [[@newellElementsTheoryHuman1958]], cognitive scientists began to model problem solving as search in a problem space.

                - Within general cognitive science, there are various N-space models

                    - [[@klahrDualSpaceSearch1988]] extended the problem space model to account for scientific discovery as joint search in a space of hypotheses and a space of experiments.

                - Quite a few detailed experiments with specific problems (e.g., [[Tower of Hanoi]]) exploring aspects of problem representation

                    - One interesting experiment is in [[@kotovskyWhatMakesProblems1990]], which identifies learning about what even constitutes a "move" as a key determinant of a problem's difficulty (in contrast to the size of the search space)

            - The core intuition across these threads is quite straightforward: in order to propose solutions for a problem, you need to have a sense of what the problem is. This allows you to check

            - In a related but separate line of research, more in the Gestalt tradition in cognitive science, research on [[Insight problem solving]] also articulates the centrality of problem representations as a determinant of impasses and problem difficulty, and the need for insight (insufficiency of "basic" procedures). This line of research seeks to explain the phenomenology and mechanics of insight or "Aha" moments, which are described by creators as an experience of an emotion-laden "leap" in progress on a problem: it often feels like solving the problem in one step, particularly after a long period of being stuck.

            - this thread is sparse, but we might define a task to try to flesh it out more, using our strategies:

                - scite

                - connectedpapers

                - relatedpapers

                - authors

                - they're not super well-connected in citation graph, though.

                - keywords from

                - semanticscholar

        - We can draw an analogy between design moves and examples - in fact, the literature in org/management science talks about "vicarious learning" as a complement to experiential learning

            - [[@baumannEffectiveSearchRugged2019]]: [[@baumannEffectiveSearchRugged2019]] and [[@csaszarHowMuchCopy2010]] are entry points into organizational lit that articulates variants of this relating to 'copying' / imitation - with one idea being that simple copying is different from "lossy" copying that induces/complements experential learning (making your own moves)

        - In sum, these lines of argumentation and evidence converge on a pathway of examples improving creative outcomes by enabling more robust (re)modeling of the problem space.

- #WorkingOn [[[[THE]] - interaction-oriented theory of creative inspiration from examples]]

    - I think what we need to do for this cycle is to:

        - {{[[DONE]]}} Draft some text in the Overleaf based on [this](Synthesis)

        - Transfer in placeholders for refs and claims in the outline [here](^^**variations in scaffolded interactions with examples**^^, first need to flesh out [[[[THE]] - interaction-oriented theory of creative inspiration from examples]])

            - Generate "solidify the case" tasks

    - Collecting the framing based on [[[[THE]] - Gero's Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) framework]]

    - re: Sketches, i think the basic message/insight at a holistic level we want to convey is the idea of "levels" - each level of behavior "unlocks" a new level of function

        - so we first identify levels of functions:

            - priming

            - repurposing

            - combination/integration

            - modeling

        - and we then analyze the behaviors observed / theorized alongside these functions, and propose affordances that "unlock" each level of function

        - one of the neat things we get from joining these affordances with functions from the lit, is we get to make predictions about specific qualitative patterns of "impairments", rather than just basic quantitative levels of inspiration.

            - for instance, if your only blocker is feeling fixated, all you need is priming, and an interface that just exposes you to inspirational examples will likely be sufficient

            - OTOH, if your blocker is feeling fixated at the problem space level, and you need to explore a better model of the space, then examples presented in lists will be insufficient, even with rich metadata. you need the ability to contextualize the examples in rich ways. this might predict when designers will step away from the computer or from a list, and reach for a whiteboard or "war room"

    - in what sense might the stimulus of the different boards be similar to examples?

    - what is an example for the MC problem?

        - so i think an example is a board + domino placement?

        - and the principle underneath is the... heuristic?

        - the object is to either show how 31 dominoes can cover the remaining 62 squares on an 8x8 checkerboard, where two diagonally opposite corners have been removed

        - solving the problem requires recognizing that parity has been violated because the corners are both the same color

    - the key insight from here that is relevant is the idea of cues that guide the generation of alternative problem spaces. i think this is one mechanism by which examples can enable (re)modeling

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FkHMzqyWaRz.png?alt=media&token=47ddf8b4-c94f-474e-99fb-c351371262f2) (p. 381)

    - they make a key connection back to [[@maierReasoningHumansII1931]]'s two-string problem, and how the accidental brushing of the string by an experimenter could trigger the requisite reformulation of the problem. i think it's an example in the sense of being a concrete (albeit) partial instantiation of a move

        - this now reminds me of the theory of [[[[THE]] - Opportunistic Assimilation Theory]], though i will have to dig into this a bit more deeply.

    - key results

        - the bit about search for representations being the difficulty, not "working out" and searching within the problem space, is also pointed to in Wason & Johnson-Laird 1972 (i wonder if this is the... card logic problem?)

        - a SOAR-based model solved the problem pretty quickly after being given a hint to represent parity in the problem representation

        - [[[[EVD]] - Representing a mutilated checkerboard in a way that made perceptual features of squares more salient facilitated problem reformulation and insight - [[@kaplanSearchInsight1990]]]]

- Let's do a touch of the [theory stuff]([[[[THE]] - interaction-oriented theory of creative inspiration from examples]]): flesh out the analogical problem formulation stuff

    - What we're trying to do here is to figure out what's on the "modeling" thread. There's something interesting there, and I think.. it's about reformulation.

    - But my thoughts feel super imprecise. And the sources feel anemic

        - Like, the reflection-in-action stuff isn't actually about examples

        - Same with the co-evolution stuff

            - {{[[DONE]]}} finish up kaplan. there's really neat stuff in the protocol analysis on the noticing invariants heuristic, which kind of gets at our theory's purpose: some folks were just better at noticing parity, but changing the problem representation physically helped move people along who might not have gottent here by themselves

                - touchstone is [figure 6](Figure 6
![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F_O11j2AgQ7.png?alt=media&token=fbbd7522-7d47-480b-8ce4-89a95775956e) (p. 408))

        - what i'm thinking about the theory rn

            - this part of the theory is the least empirically clean

                - i wonder if this is because... a lot of this stuff happens over long time scales, and isn't easy to study in an experiment

                - this might explain why i'm more likely to notice this in an expensive protocol study, or interviews or ethnographies

            - there's also the connection to the [[co-evolution of problem and solution space]] and [[Reflection-in-Action]] stuff that is... sort of non-obvious on first consideration, but upon deeper refelction actually suggests a sensible and insightful connection

                - this lit is all about how desigenrs reflect on *their own* moves.

                - but if their moves are concrete, and examples are concrete, then it stands to reason that simlar mechanisms may be at play

                - i mean, the reformulation that the insight problem solving folks observe in their various problems resemble this idea of "i make a move, i notice something else new about the problem and hcange it somehow"

            - but this alos feels really rich, like ther's something interesting and new here, beyond your "basic" conceptual combination - this isn't legos or even blending/cooking, it's.. something more.

                - and you're also constrained in what kinds of moves you can generate.

                - but being able to analyze the examples and moves of others, and juxtapose against your own problem, and sort of play out what that does to your problem space, that... feels like it could be really powerful and scalable (sort of like simulations!), and i suspect that is in fact what many top-level designers are doing, albeit in a variety of ways, some just in their heads

                - the reason i feel this is significant, is.. moves are expensive. your own moves. it's rate-limiting.

                - there's a question of whether this reformulation stuff is best triggered by abstract heuristics and principles, and. ..i don't think it's the case. i think there's eomthign about mapping between and attending to concrete cues that is really helpful and facilitates actual transf.er ther'es context in there.

[[February 10th, 2022]]

- #WorkingOn [[[[THE]] - interaction-oriented theory of creative inspiration from examples]], mining the modeling thread following leads from [[Cedric Chin]].

    - but first, let's reify some stuff here.

    - the grounding observation for this thread in terms of data are:

        - examples to trends and approaches, not linear transfer ([Sharmin, 2009]([[[[EVD]] - professional designers curated examples to understand trends and design approaches to inform their design, vs. simple direct transfer of solution approaches - [[@sharminUnderstandingKnowledgeManagement2009b]]]]))

        - examples to shaping understanding of problem ([Herring, 2009]([[[[EVD]] - designers used examples to shape their understanding of the problem before generating solutions - [[@herringGettingInspiredUnderstanding2009]]]]))

    - for the thread on [[[[THE]] - Cognitive Flexibility Theory (CFT)]], the key idea here is inspiration from examples as learning (in the adaptive expertise sense)

        - inducing flexible models of a domain that can be recognized and leveraged to respond to novelty: that is... essentially what we want when we say inspiration (rather than fixation) from examples!

        - the idea here is that the theory provides the functional outcome and fleshes out what we mean by "modeling"

        - and the systems that follow from this  might be inspiration or help to articulate the key affordances

        - cedric has already articulated one: backlinking, to allow for flexible, context-rich exploration of cases
[[January 16th, 2022]]

- #WorkingOn transferring Sources from [[[[THE]] - interaction-oriented theory of creative inspiration from examples]] into Overleaf

    - Thinking about [[retrieval-induced forgetting]]: it's not really directly related to example exposure - here, people are practicing for memory retrieval, and the idea is related to inhibitory processes, which [[@stormThinkingCanCause2011]] hypothesizes (and shows evidence) that it is actually a way to *reduce* [[ðŸ§± fixation]], not an index of fixation per se.

        - So it's really about how [[[[CL]] - Executive functions, such as cognitive control and inhibition, are a net positive for generating creative ideas]]

        - Which is why I moved it out of the CLM about stimulating exploration from examples

        - In other words, people who have more inhibition ability are less susceptible to fixation from examples

            - this kind of relates to the relationship between [[cognitive control]] and creativity (see lots of stuff by [[Roger E. Beaty]], like [[@beatyWhyIdeasGet2012]] and [[@frithKeepingCreativityControl2021]])

        - theory: rough snapshot #[[ðŸšš outline]] for [[[[THE]] - interaction-oriented theory of creative inspiration from examples]]

    - basic pitch:

        - theory seems really useful! we want to test it

        - probably best in a contentful setting; our experiments with the wildcat wells problem helped us realize this

        - [[@macneilProbMapAutomaticallyConstructing2021]] is a good environment we can explore

        - want to collaborate?

        - next step is to iterate with theory to design the contrasts - what interface designs might maximize people's ability to benefit from related problem formulations?

    - feedback:

        - theory does seem really useful!

        - push much harder on trying to understand exploration behavior, slice and dice that way

            - curious about data literacy as a thing here - would have been great to get a measure of this to control for or structure our understanding of the diff strategies - higher data literacy = easier to contextualize; if lower, interface affordances probably matter more

                - what would be the analog in different design problems?

        - follow up on this more

- #WorkingOn [[[[THE]] - interaction-oriented theory of creative inspiration from examples]]

    - #writing/DraftText for motivation and grounding

        - What is the purpose of this theory?

            - The purpose of this theory is to provide a bridge between fundamental theories of creative inspiration from diverse examples, and concrete design recommendations for interfaces, with affordances and behaviors as a key connector.

            - To the best of our knowledge, we don't have such a theory, though we do have a collection of design heuristics strewn across the HCI literature.

            - So we synthesize two strands of literature:

                - Basic studies of inspiration from examples, with careful attention to the mechanisms of action

                - Proposals for systems for interacting with examples to support creative work, with careful attention to the design rationales provided

            - We do not intend for our synthesized theory to be a strong, a priori prescriptive theory: instead, we expect that designers in particular settings will want to use the theory's predictions and heuristics as starting hypotheses to test and refine in their specific settings with their specific users. The key test of our theory should be its __utility__: the degree to which it equips designers with a reasonable starting point and framework for making key design choices, such as availability of metadata, display layouts, sorting and filtering options, and so forth.

        - What is the grounding for this theory?

            - We ground our theory in N key ways.

                - First, we synthesize theoretical claims about mechanisms of inspiration with careful attention to strength of evidence

                - Second, we illustrate the generativity of the theory by articulating N design predictions

                - Finally, we empirically test one of the design predictions with a controlled experiment

        - What is the theory?

            - In basic terms, we claim that there are N key mechanisms of inspiration

                - So far we have these mechanisms: 1) priming, 2) integration, and 3) modeling

                    - These are cognitive mechanisms and operations

            - What are the behavioral elements that connect these to interfaces?

                - Compare

                    - View side by side

                    - Sort, rank

                - View (this is the lowest level)

                - Contextualize

                    - Filter

                    - Spatially arrange

                - Analyze

                    - Thinking of product dissection stuff from [[@tohImpactExampleModality2014]]

                    - Also seen in Eckert 2003's ["source analysis" strategy]([[[[EVD]] - designers used a range of strategies for working with sources of inspiration, ranging from simpler, more source-driven strategies like direct source adaptation, to more complex and reflective strategies like source analysis and schema-driven source selection; complex strategies were more likely to be used by professionals and also more associated with radical transformation of sources - [[@eckertAdaptationSourcesInspiration2003]]]])

    - Scoping inspiration from examples, vs. principles. Must have some base level of concreteness. So, not just a word (though in conceptual combination stuff, the words are examples because the output is a word)

    - Reading [[@wilkenfeldSimilarityEmergenceConceptual2001]] for [[[[QUE]] - Under what conditions do diverse initial examples lead to better final design solutions?]] | generating concepts from dissimilar word pairs led to more complex combination methods (e.g., relational linking) and emergent features, compared to similar word pairs

    - I migrated all breadcrumbs from the previous days, and draft text from Overleaf back here, for proper synthesis

    - Separated the synthesis and sources section

    - Moved all placeholder cites to the sources section

    - Realize now that what happened was that we were interested in exploring designer- and interaction-side influences on effects of diversity, and ended up realizing we needed a basic theory of how *any* example would be influenced by interaction-side factors first, then narrow down to diverse examples (which I think would be mostly the comparison one, and maybe modeling)

                - Study

                    - An online experiment (N=45 participants) to evaluate the benefits and tradeoffs of the IdeateRelate system (Viz condition) compared to a simple list view (No-Viz condition).

                    - As a study procedure, participants first generated their own idea for solving a COVID-related challenge. Then participants explored all 637 ideas â€” either using IdeateRelate (Viz condition) or a list view (No-Viz condition) â€” and curated at least seven ideas to help them refine their own proposals. Finally, participants generated a final concept while viewing the curated subset of examples.

                        - Curating a list includes [[view]], [[analyze]] and [[compare]]?

                    - Measure of similarity

                    - How did they know whether/how people adopted langaug from examples?

                - Results

                    - Viz participants tended to explore examples more similar to their own whereas No-Viz participants explored more randomly.

                        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F6NGoIxz8ZK.png?alt=media&token=1a280a14-17d9-4422-9e31-9802cfe6c1a8)

                    - However, this increased influence of the examples did not mean users simply emulated them; we found no negative effect on the overall novelty.

                    - Viz participants leveraged both category and semantic distance data, in different ways, to hone in on primarily similar examples.

                        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FSccfOsbMtu.png?alt=media&token=03488ec0-70c6-445e-bd1b-ce3d36c21c65)

                    - Viz participants also adopted more language from the examples they curated.

                        - [[contextualize]] could help [[combine & integrate]] similar examples which is one level lower

                        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F49BxUOijF4.png?alt=media&token=33ebfa81-0f4d-40f6-9e49-4ad8d3759d60)

                    - Instances of [[combine & integrate]] and [[model]] functional outcomes

                        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F71_ykYO85h.png?alt=media&token=7c2fccd3-99c5-49f0-a990-7a6576f7003e)

                        - Users' ideas first; examples with low diversity (similar to users' ideas) might help [[combine & integrate]]; examples with high diversity (far from users' ideas) might help [[model]]

                - Research questions

                    - 1) How do creators leverage a visualization of conceptual distance to explore examples compared to a list?

                    - 2) How do people curate examples to help them improve their own ideas differently when using a visualization versus a list of ideas?

[[February 16th, 2022]]

- ^^IMPORTANT^^ connecting back to the [[[[THE]] - interaction-oriented theory of creative inspiration from examples]], i think... the key idea here from CFT is that CFT says, cases are amazing but you also need to create the capacity to construct flexible schemas/models from them. and they think structuring things as a hypertext thing is a way to enable interactions with cases that facilitate this flexible schema-building. **latent models**, not static or even reified models, but latent ones. they do not 'exist" statically in reality, but are constructed on the fly, not from cases alone, but from this latent model that is instantiated by the connections between the cases

    - this means that "evergreen notes" that "distill" ideas from the cases may be HARMFUL. but not if they are treated more as indices (like [[Maps of Content]]???) and handles, rather than The Actual Thing
[[March 15th, 2022]]

- for [theory paper]([[[[THE]] - interaction-oriented theory of creative inspiration from examples]]): [[[[EVD]] - higher conceptual flexibility to classify organisms based on taxonomic and ecological relations if children were older, from more rural areas, and engaged in more unstructured interactions with organisms - [[@betzDevelopmentConceptualFlexibility2020]]]] is really about **goal-directed/integrated** interactions (unstructured != unstructured! it's really self-directed, through play) vs. imposed org from others

    - idea then: interfaces that allow for self-imposed, *goal-directed* classification and remodeling according to constraints of task, are far better for modeling than interfaces that enable self-imposed classification, but not integrated into the goal-directed work (e.g., organize beforehand, but not during task), or are classified by others (i'm think actually that this latter one is really how most scholarly comm interfaces are!)

    - this connects back to finding of network differences between montessori and "regular" kids from that paper from [[Roger E. Beaty]]: [[[[EVD]] - estimated semantic networks of animal concepts from montessori-educated children were more interconnected, with shorter paths between concepts and fewer subcommunities, compared to networks from traditional-schooled but comparable children - [[@denervaudEducationShapesStructure2021]]]]

        - uses this [[m/Triangulated Maximally Filtered Graph (TMFG)]] method for estimating a network. it's a bit strange, but seems.... useful? roots in big data. lots of usage by [[Yoed N. Kenett]] and friends

[[March 7th, 2022]]

- where does the hypertext stuff fit into [[[[THE]] - interaction-oriented theory of creative inspiration from examples]]? i have forgotten. let's remember:

    - inducing flexible models of a domain that can be recognized and leveraged to respond to novelty: that is... essentially what we want when we say inspiration (rather than fixation) from examples!

    - so the hypertext stuff is coming more at it from the affordances perspective, while CFT is giving us theory.

    - ok so i think i should go back to the theory page as the main annotated bib.

    - where does it fit?

        - i'm not sure that it does, honestly. at least neatly.

        - properly, CFT asks "how shoudl we structure uyour interacitno with cases so that you develop the ability to flexibly compose them into schemas for a particular (novel) task"?

        - in our theory, we are asking, "how should we structure your interactions with examples so that they can help you (re)compose your formulation

            - [[[[EVD]] - Two artists used individual artworks to shape not just their ideas, but used a process of "analogical modification" to search for and modify higher-order concepts, and their creative vision. This process unfolded over the course of years. - [[@okadaAnalogicalModificationCreation2009]]]]

    - A key thing to note at the beginning is that [[[[CLM]] - Effective problem formulation is-necessary-for creative knowledge work]]

        - [[@dorstCoreDesignThinking2011]] makes this point forcefully

        - And the [[Insight problem solving]] literature explores this experimentally quite well.

[[outlineDSolution-Diversity C&C interaction-oriented theory of examples inspiration]]

- ## [[[[THE]] - interaction-oriented theory of creative inspiration from examples]]

    - We proposed a theory (model? framework?)

        - (closest analog I can think of is [[@towneDesignConsiderationsOnline2012]])

    - Secondarily, *if* these functional outcomes are important for creative performance on the particular task, we can also hypothesize (from the theory) relationships between the interface structures and creative outcomes.

    - The basic predictions of the theory have to do with how variations in the structure of interfaces might lead to different functional outcomes from examples, based on the behavioral affordances they support. For example, we expect that interfaces that do not support analysis of examples (or make them more difficult), will make it more difficult for people to repurpose examples. Note that supporting comparison and contextualization inherently also enables a form of analysis, such as abstraction.

- let's keep the soldiv trail warm. #WorkingOn [[[[THE]] - interaction-oriented theory of creative inspiration from examples]]

    - i think the place of highest uncertainty is the "modeling" part. so let's push on that.

    - the eckert result isn't really about modeling or integration. it's also analyzing a single source, so... i moved it out of integration and modeling. it's also not naturalistic.

    - ok my gut says the next actions are:

        - flesh out the analogical problem formulation stuff

        - and... pull more on the design examples invivo thread

[[June 15th, 2022]]

- Reading [[@luceroFramingAligningParadoxing2012]] for [[[[THE]] - interaction-oriented theory of creative inspiration from examples]]

    - We're spanning two literatures that don't interact as much: the fundamental cognitive literature, which provides mechanisms ([[analogy]], [[ðŸ§± conceptual combination]]), and more applied/design literature, that is rich in context, and respects differences and similarities across design disciplines. Keep this in mind, and counteract the cognitive tendency to collapse them under "creative work". Look for the generative differences and nuances. Synthesize!

    - There are also methodological implications of this theory, mostly for experimental studies: we cannot divorce the effects of examples from the means of interaction with them. That much is clear from studies of design practice with examples. I am now much more suspicious of negative findings about diverse or distant examples.

    - I'm struck by the discussion of out of domain examples. Really really really reminiscent of [[[[CLM]] - A significant proportion of the benefits of analogical stimuli is oblique or indirect]]: it's not about direct transfer of features, but of.... *stimulating a conversation*, a rethinking. How does this happen? Through juxtaposition, reinterpretation, conversation.

        - Again, reminds me so much of the richness in [[[[EVD]] - designers used a range of strategies for working with sources of inspiration, ranging from simpler, more source-driven strategies like direct source adaptation, to more complex and reflective strategies like source analysis and schema-driven source selection; complex strategies were more likely to be used by professionals and also more associated with radical transformation of sources - [[@eckertAdaptationSourcesInspiration2003]]]]

    - # Some notes

        - Behavior side is the weakest rn

            - i have an idea for method: [[M - Content Analysis]] of verbs from the functional side

        - What is our criteria for functional outcomes?

            - coherence x empirical and theoretical footprint

            - not so different from [[m/Grounded Theory]] i suppose

                - grounded theory from theories!

        - Expertise can overcome limitations of behavioral affordances - we often see experts working with examples in the sophisticated functional outcomes above view/stimulate, because of their rich schemas. here we have an opportunity to scaffold novices towards these behaviors through more intelligent interface design

    - # Motivation

        - Interactive systems that facilitate exposure to examples have potential to augment designers' creative performance.

        - We would like to have a consistent theory to draw from to make these decisions. This theory could help us design better system with sensible defaults, and guide what data we should collect to know if our system is helping or not.

        - Therefore, our high level goal in this project is to develop a theoretical framework that can bridge the theory-design-practice gap to inform the design of interactive systems for creative design from examples.

        - When we try to design systems for interacting with examples, we are faced with a number of very practical interaction design decisions.

            - Examples:

                - How should we support interaction with examples over different screen sizes?

                - Should examples be delivered via recommendation (in small sets), a feed, or some other interaction paradigm?

                - What information should be be presented alongside an example?

        - But we don't have a theory that can directly inform these design decisions.

            - On the slip side, there is a lot of empirical work on different example interfaces in HCI, but little integration across the studies into a coherent theory.

            - Prior theories of the effects of examples can speak to how variations in levels of diversity influence the creative process and outputs, but their level of description does not provide adequate guidance for these interaction design decisions.

            - For example, there is a lot of research on conceptual combination in psychology, but the majority of that work focuses on pairs of examples only, and so cannot speak to situations where interaction design decisions about screen size may come in, such as with a larger number of examples.

            - This is reminiscent of the conceptual gap that [[@oulasvirtaHCIResearchProblemSolving2016]] identifies between the empirical and constructive knowledge bases in HCI:

                - > Even if HCI puts strong emphasis on construction, its conceptual work has not been powerful enough to drive it. We can carry out ever more sophisticated studies, with larger samples and more complex set-up, ad infinitum, but without conceptual contributions that link empirical findings and the design of technology, the results will remain unactionable. From a problem-solving perspective, without conceptual â€˜glueâ€™ to anchor them, constructive contributions readily remain point designs and empirical studies point studies (p. 4962)

    - # Current sketch of the theory:

        - ## Approach

            - These models are useful in design practice and theory for modeling design problems and processes; here, we find it useful as a framework to bridge between fundamental theories and studies, which can articulate desired **functional outcomes** of interfaces for interacting with examples, and key design decisions about the **structure(s)** of artifacts and designs for such interfaces. The **behavior(s)** that mediate interactions between structure and function can be thought of as the desired affordances of the system.

            - We're playing with the idea of bridging of these strands of literature based on an influential family of models in design theory that model design as a process of constructing connections between three different aspects of a design object: 1) its **function** - what it is for, 2) its **behavior** - what it does, and 3) its **structure** - what it is (e.g, its components and their interrelationships).

            - One of the most influential of these models is [[[[THE]] - Gero's Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) framework]], but there are important variants such as Goel's Structure-Behavior-Function (SBF) model [[@goelStructureBehaviorFunction2009]].

        - ## Overview

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FWdAef-euc0.png?alt=media&token=9d7b37ef-f2a3-4dab-a9e1-55f1795799d3)

            - From the literature, we synthesize four levels of functional outcomes of examples that can lead to creative inspiration: in ascending order of sophistication, these are:

                - 4) **model**: greater distance between the specific features of examples and what ideas result: rather than serving as stimulation, or sources of specific features to transfer or recombine, the examples are used to induce a higher level model of one or more relevant design spaces, problem formulations, or frames, which then guides exploration

                - 1) **stimulate**: examples can directly shape ideation by providing features or conceptual elements to use, or priming a direction of thinking

                - 2) **repurpose**: similar to stimulating, but goes a step further: rather than transferring all or most of the elements of an example, this outcome involves taking particular elements from the example and using it in a new idea in a way that departs significantly from the example

                - 3) **combine and integrate**: builds on the previous ones: rather than transferring or repurposing elements from a single example, this outcome combines or integrates elements from multiple examples into a new whole. Often this new whole is greater than the sum of its parts, with emergent properties of the whole that are not true of its parts.

            - These levels of functional outcomes are then mapped to four key behaviors of working with examples: 1) viewing, 2) analyzing, 3) comparing, and 4) contextualizing.

                - The intuition behind this mapping is that each of these behaviors "unlocks" a particular level of functional outcome: for example, enabling analysis behavior unlocks the functional outcome of repurposing (simply viewing is insufficient), and enabling comparison behaviors unlocks the functional outcomes of combination and integration.

        - ## The details

            - Broadly speaking:

                - **Stimulate** comes from robust and large literature on example fixation and priming. See [here](Stimulate: [[[[CLM]] - Examples can improve creative outcomes by stimulating more exploration away from obvious starting points]]). It is worth noting that a lot of observations here are __negative__ effects of examples, such as reducing diversity and sometimes quantity of ideas.

                - **Repurpose** comes from the insight problem solving and analogical problem solving literature, and the big mass of studies following up on the fixations tuff to try to unpack their boundary conditions. There is also some good insights from user studies of designers working with examples in the wild. See [here](Repurpose).

                - **Combine and Integrate** comes mostly from conceptual combination literature. Here also there is some good insights from user studies of designers working with examples in the wild.

                - **Model** comes mostly from design theory and studies of designers working with examples in the wild. The intuition
