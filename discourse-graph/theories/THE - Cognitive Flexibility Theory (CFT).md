[[February 10th, 2022]]

- for the thread on [[[[THE]] - Cognitive Flexibility Theory (CFT)]], the key idea here is inspiration from examples as learning (in the adaptive expertise sense)

    - inducing flexible models of a domain that can be recognized and leveraged to respond to novelty: that is... essentially what we want when we say inspiration (rather than fixation) from examples!

    - the idea here is that the theory provides the functional outcome and fleshes out what we mean by "modeling"

    - and the systems that follow from this  might be inspiration or help to articulate the key affordances

    - cedric has already articulated one: backlinking, to allow for flexible, context-rich exploration of cases

The same point can be made about John Snow’s cholera map, Feynman QED diagrams, and our other most powerful representations." / Twitter

[[THE - interaction-oriented theory of creative inspiration from examples]]

- But there is also concepts and evidence along the lines of [[[[THE]] - Cognitive Flexibility Theory (CFT)]] that, on first blush, does not seem to be directly related to creativity support tools, but shares a deep underlying connection.

    - Certain kinds of experiences (unstructured, self-directed, contextualized) lead to representations that are more conceptually flexible, and can be applied in new ways
