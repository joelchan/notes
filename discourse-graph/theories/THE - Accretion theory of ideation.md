- Proposed by:: [[Ricardo Sosa]] in [[@sosaAccretionTheoryIdeation2019]]
- [[[[CLM]] - Ideas develop simultaneously at multiple timescales, levels of granularity, and completeness]]

- Model has implications for how we assess "ideas" (ans: depends on what stage it is in the accretion process; throughout, you want ideas to "move things forward", from "fertility" to "potency", to "traction")

- i have a very vague connection here to [[[[CL]] - Multiplicity is necessary for synthesis]] and [[[[THE]] - Accretion theory of ideation]], and the idea of a single "idea"

    - [[@gruberDarwinManPsychological1974]] talks about htis a lot too
[[MeetingNotes  arvind - joel  July 5th, 2022]]

- and use-based: what does this make you thnk of? does this seem fruitful: [[[[THE]] - Accretion theory of ideation]] - we're probably mapping to the ideasimals stage here

- As a side note, the idea of direct application vs. creative adaption might be nicely grounded in the [[[[THE]] - Accretion theory of ideation]] (from [[@sosaAccretionTheoryIdeation2019]]), which, among other things, states that ideas (particularly in the early stages of design) should be judged less on whether it's immediately useful, and more on whether it is *generative* (leads to new perspectives, new ideas)
