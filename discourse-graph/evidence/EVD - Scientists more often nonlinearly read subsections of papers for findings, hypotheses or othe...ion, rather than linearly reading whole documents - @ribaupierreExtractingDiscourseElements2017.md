- **Summary**

    - Scientists were rarely (on average, about 1/3 of the time at most) interested in reading the whole paper; instead they are interested in specific elements, such as a finding, a method, a hypothesis, or a definition (p.5) #Atomicity

    - Method: ~2 hr semi-structured interview, focusing on information-retrieval behavior as well as reading behavior
