- Summary::

    - Drawing portal design ideas worked well with Grade 6, but less well for Grade 3, due to mechanical difficulties (requiring more time), and difficulty matching designers' desired level of granularity (children had trouble focusing on just one aspect)

    - They felt like they had to give concrete exemplars (despite risk of [[ðŸ§± fixation]]

    - They also had problems with the Grade 3 children interpreting things too literally (and having problems with abstract ideas like analogies)

- **Grounding Context**

    - Context: two intergenerational teams (3 researchers across all, one with eight Grade 6 students, one with six Grade 3 students), operating in a public elementary school in a middle-class Canadian suburb, designing Web portals to find information for class-based projects. The design project was informally perceived as a success in terms of the output design prototype being preferred to Google/MSN by the users (no formal eval yet).

    - Design sessions were conducted in the art room of the school twice/week during lunch break (70 mins, 55 for the actual session)
