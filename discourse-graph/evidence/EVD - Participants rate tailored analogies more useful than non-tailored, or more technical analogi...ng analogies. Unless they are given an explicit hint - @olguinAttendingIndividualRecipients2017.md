- # Summary

    - Experiment 1

        - Participants were 32.65% successful in writing complete analogies and 57.07% were categorized as incomplete analogies.

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FPJ5jAP0y25.png?alt=media&token=86dc0f20-068f-4d1c-a754-abd870aa8a55) (Pg 4)

        - 7.77% of the non-hinted group wrote analogies which pertained to the target while 70.11% wrote analogies pertaining to the target

        - Participants ability to create complete analogies was not related to their ability to create analogies in general

    - Experiment 2

        - 25.33% of the analogies were classified as complete analogies and 64% were classified as complete analogies

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FMparkL8mwr.png?alt=media&token=73289ee3-0b26-4547-863a-77722f8312bf) (Pg 5)

        - 10% of the analogies in the non-hinted group were recipient tailored, while 63.36% of the hinted group were recipient tailored

        - As in Experiment 1 there was no correlation between the amount of analogies produced and the number of complete analogies

    - Experiment 3

        - Participants rated tailored analogies more persuasive than the technical analogies group and the unrelated conceptual metaphor group.

- # Grounding Context

    - Experiment 1

        - 80 Psychology students at University of Comahue participated

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F74Ni0DAmpD.png?alt=media&token=1b2660b9-be78-4fba-bdb2-d8dacb7d70fb) (Pg 3)

        - Participants were divided into two groups. One hinted and one non-hinted

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FCfPI73GWin.png?alt=media&token=373b0f99-1ab0-40dd-8575-5d74f513063f) (pg 3)

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FRqQ7g7Cfhp.png?alt=media&token=947d4078-bc13-4e5e-80bf-3c4868ffa715) (pg 4)

        - participants were asked to provide analogies for the protagonist of a story. The hinted group were given the prompt to base their analogies of the protagonists activities in the story the non-hinted group was not given this scaffolding.

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FS1_SU7ocF4.png?alt=media&token=9dfdb8f1-f5b8-4fec-9850-eb18c9fb96e9) (Pg 4)

    - Experiment 2

        - 80 students of psychology at the University of Comahue

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FKCmBFtca3I.png?alt=media&token=4c0bf3d2-c30a-4ce7-988a-d722a8621a85) (Pg 5)

        - Participants were put into the same groups as [Experiment 1](Participants were divided into two groups. One hinted and one non-hinted) and participated in the same [activity](((-OTFGlI5S))) as well. However, they were given a three minute video to watch rather than a text-based story to provide analogies

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FCqfPxFjrAD.png?alt=media&token=dcb4dee6-5a9e-402a-a263-c3c32e146780) (Pg 5)

    - Experiment 3

        - 160 Psychology students at University of Comahue participated

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2Fi3vEPlifY4.png?alt=media&token=d49734bc-28f2-45eb-963c-6a777efcbf8c) (Pg 7)

        - Participants were put into 1 of 4 groups which compared tailored analogies to 1 of 4 categories. Categories are technical intradomain(phsychology terms which required knowledge to know), non-technical intradomain(information which people at large would know), interdomain derived from conceptual metaphor, and interdomain not associated with conceptual metaphor.

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FGtaM8ypdx1.png?alt=media&token=22f1692c-1bf5-4525-aad3-799d5f485afe) (Pg 8)

        - Provided an instructional information about the usefulness of analogies and on current ideas surrounding tailoring analogies to participants knowledge.

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F-J1QtM3TOP.png?alt=media&token=19ca25a2-99e9-41ab-a190-6b875f6362d4) (Pg 8)

        - Same as in [Experiment 1](participants were asked to provide analogies for the protagonist of a story. The hinted group were given the prompt to base their analogies of the protagonists activities in the story the non-hinted group was not given this scaffolding.) participants were given a story, but were asked to assess the perceived persuasiveness of the analogies.
