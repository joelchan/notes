- # Grounding Context

    - participants: 21 participants from a software research company (5 female)

    - materials: a set of maps created by 12 participants from the same software research company (2 female) using similar procedures, with each map going through four total iterations.

    - map creation portion

        - task 1: map creation task: create a map in Powerpoint with clippings for everyday sensemaking topics, such as vacation and party planning, options for starting a vegetable garden and DIY kitchen remodeling. overall time limit was ~20 minutes.

        - design 1: within-subjects experiment - participants created knowledge maps for three different topics, each in one of three conditions: 1) solo, 2) other (starting with a map that was created by one other person), and 3) iterated (starting with a map that was created by one other person and iterated on by 3 other people)

        - measure: survey, measuring self-rated cognitive effort, map quality, helpfulness of others' maps and their maps for others

###### Discourse Context

- **Supports::** [[CLM - It is possible to benefit from receiving intermediate sensemaking outputs from others, particularly if those outputs have been iterated on]]
- **Consistent With::** [[EVD - highest self-rated map quality, as measured by overall quality, and helpfulness to others, wh...er person, for the same everyday sensemaking topic - @fisherDistributedSensemakingImproving2012]]
- **FromSource::** [[@fisherDistributedSensemakingImproving2012]]
