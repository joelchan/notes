- # Summary

    - Both groups performed similarly when solving the problem on the instructional video

    - Results revealed no significant difference in test scores across groups

    - Students scored significantly higher on low similarity problems on the posttest when they were in the high cue group

- # Grounding Context

    - 34 11-12 year old boys and girls were recruited from an upper middle class urban school. Four were excluded from the results due to absence

    - Two Instructional videos were created, one being a low cue video and the other being a high cue video. Both provided the same problem, but the high cue video provided more scaffolding using visuals and analogies to instruct the students

    - Students were given a pretest, a posttest and a posttest with a delay to assess their understanding.

    - Test responses were given a code of 1 or a 0 determine accuracy of the answer. A code of .5 could have been given if participants met a part of the criteria.

    - A Shapiro-Wilk test of normality, Friedman's two-way analysis of variance by ranks, Wilcoxon Signed ranks test and logistic regression were used to analyze data.
