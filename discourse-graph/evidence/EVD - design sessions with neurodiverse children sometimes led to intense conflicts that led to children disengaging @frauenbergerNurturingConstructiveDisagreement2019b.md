    - ## Summary::

        - Design sessions with neurodiverse children sometimes led to intense conflicts that led to children disengaging

        - In one example, one child disengaged because of conflicts with other children over how to play with a design material

        - In another example, a child disengaged because he felt left out and was distraught

        - The researchers used agonistic participatory design to focus on the positive aspects of conflict in design and to navigate power dynamics. (p. 9)

        - With this methods, researchers encountered three different levels of conflict in which children may disengage. (p. 6)

    - ## **Grounding Context**

        - Conducted PD with two groups of neurodiverse children from two different schools over the course of a school year (10 students; 2 teachers) approximately once every two weeks to design technologies that supported social play through the process of creating agonistic spaces (or Thinging technology) and turning conflict into design features. They created the two technologies called Music Pads and Light Spaces. (p. 4)
