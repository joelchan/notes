- Summary

    - No reduction in [total time, total moves, or illegal moves](General measures: transfer, as measured by reduction in total time, total number of moves, and total number of illegal moves, as measured by experimenter present) when [undergraduates](((Hjks4_nO3))) attempted to solve a [problem](((ObHMVIlWl))) after solving a previous analogous problem
