- # Summary

    - slight advantage of similar analog pairs compared to one analog; biggest advantage for dissimilar analog pairs, although still quite a bit lower than ceiling (~50% before hint)

    - Participants:

    - Procedure

    - Conditions: one analog, compare two similar, compare two dissimilar

        - Simple instruction to compare the two stories and write about how theya re simlar

- **Informs::** [[THE - interaction-oriented theory of creative inspiration from examples]]
- **Supports::** [[CLM - People are more likely to benefit from analogies if they encounterprocess them with an active goal or license to use them for inspiration]]
- **Consistent With::** [[EVD - Replicated the results of Gick and Holyoak in providing results showing that when providing a hint and an analogy students were more likely to produce a convergent solution]]
