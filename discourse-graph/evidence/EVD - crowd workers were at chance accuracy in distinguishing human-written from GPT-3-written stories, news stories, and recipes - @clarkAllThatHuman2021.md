    - crowd workers were at chance accuracy in distinguishing human-written from GPT-3-written stories, news stories, and recipes

    - note: they were slightly better at this (above chance) for stories and news for [[sys/GPT-2]] generated text

    - training with examples and feedback only slightly improved accuracy (unclear if now diff. from chance)

    - basic result seems to be replicated by https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.06835.pdf

    - also note: inter-rater reliability was very low!
