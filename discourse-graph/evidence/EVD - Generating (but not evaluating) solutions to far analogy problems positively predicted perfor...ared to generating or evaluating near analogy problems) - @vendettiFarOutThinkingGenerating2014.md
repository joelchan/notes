- # Summary

    - more likely to process picture-mapping task relationally (choose relational objects) if they generated solutions for [[four-term analogy problems]] with far vs. near analogies, as in experiment 1b, vs. evaluating whether four-term analogies are valid, as in experiment 1a

        - procedure: do abridged [[RAVENS progressive matrices]] to measure fluid intelligence, then do verbal analogy task as in experiment 1a (but only valid analogy problems), then do picture mapping task

“…In summary, although neither experiment 1 nor experiment 2 alone replicate the pattern from Vendetti et al (2014) exactly, combining the results of experiments 1 and 2 show quite similar values to the prior research. This raises our confidence that the current experiments successfully tapped into the same cognitive processes as Vendetti et al (2014), while highlighting the need to compare the magnitude of relationships across conditions without relying on a difference between a statistically significant versus nonsignificant finding.…”

            - the trail goes cold here..... :( no more follow-up supporting or opposing cites. we have stopped with two sets of studies with western undergrads!!!!!
