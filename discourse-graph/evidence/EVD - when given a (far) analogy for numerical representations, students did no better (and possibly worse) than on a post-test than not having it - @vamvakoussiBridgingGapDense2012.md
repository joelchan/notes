title: [[EVD]] - when given a (far) analogy for numerical representations, students did no better (and possibly worse) than on a post-test than not having it - [[@vamvakoussiBridgingGapDense2012]]

- # Summary

    - No difference was found between the two scenarios. Including the number-line representation actually had an adverse effect on some students

- # Grounding Context

    - 229 7th to 11th grade students in central and northern Greece

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FcRcXXZM4vj.png?alt=media&token=ed7da6c6-0ec3-45b1-ab3c-d13185406338)

    - A questionnaire was given to the students which included a number-block scenario(how many numbers existed between two rational numbers) or a number-blockLine scenario(same as before but represented as a number line)
