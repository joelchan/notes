- Summary::

    - Undergrad MechE students generated [more novel ideas](![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FFpD8OIL6XK.png?alt=media&token=1180329c-b21e-43bc-8948-10d7f84de5b3) (p. 212)) when receiving [[far analogies]] at the after ideation had begun (during a break) compared to seeing them before ideation began

- **Grounding Context**

    - Problem: generate conceptual designs for time-keeping devices using only a provided list of household objects, such as adhesive tape, twine, tupperware containers, box of matches, thermometer, etc.

        - So a spin on classic [[alternative uses task]]

    - Participants: 71 undergrad senior mechanical engineering students at a major private university

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FQCDylYAR3V.png?alt=media&token=0164f153-e5d9-41cf-be46-01413bb951cd) (p. 207)

    - Design: single factor, 4 between-subjects condition (nothing aka control vs. vs. [surface similar]([[near analogies]]) before problem (clocks) vs. [surface dissimilar]([[far analogies]]) (water meter, heart rate monitor, cassette tape recorded) before problem vs. surface dissimilar during problem (after filler task). All stimuli text only.

        - Irrelevant for filler task was three short summaries of current news stories

        - Near devices: grandfather clock, windup clock, and quartz wristwatch

        - Distant devices: heart rate monitor, cassette tape deck, and water meter

    - Procedure: generally, start with 3-min reading task (material depends on condition), then 5 mins to work on problem, then 3 min "filler task" (where material again depends on condition), and then final 10 mins to work on problem (for a total of ~21 mins). All participants instructed not to repeat previous solutions.

    - Dependent measures:

        - Total number of designs

        - Number of functional repeats (a variant way of measuring [[ðŸ§± fixation]] or [[diversity]] (reverse))

        - Number of functionally distinct designs (a variant way of measuring (reverse) [[ðŸ§± fixation]] or [[diversity]] )

        - Novelty of each solution

        - All functional measures relied on a functional categorization, which had two researchers independently assign one or more functional categories (from a bottom-up generated list of 16 categories) to each solution. NOTE: singular solutions (functional categories that only one person generated) were lumped together into a single "other" category, comprising 3% of solutions. [[inter-rater reliability]] was pretty good, at [[Cohen's K]] = 0.87

    - Analysis: pairwise comparisons with independent samples t-tests, no corrections for multiple comparisons
