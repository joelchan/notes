title: [[EVD]] - highest self-rated map quality, as measured by overall quality, and helpfulness to others, when creating map based on previous map that was iterated on by multiple people, compared to creating from scratch, and basing on a map created by one other person, for the same everyday sensemaking topic - [[@fisherDistributedSensemakingImproving2012]]

- # Grounding Context

    - participants: 21 participants from a software research company (5 female)

    - materials: a set of maps created by 12 participants from the same software research company (2 female) using similar procedures, with each map going through four total iterations.

    - map creation portion

        - task 1: map creation task: create a map in Powerpoint with clippings for everyday sensemaking topics, such as vacation and party planning, options for starting a vegetable garden and DIY kitchen remodeling. overall time limit was ~20 minutes.

        - design 1: within-subjects experiment - participants created knowledge maps for three different topics, each in one of three conditions: 1) solo, 2) other (starting with a map that was created by one other person), and 3) iterated (starting with a map that was created by one other person and iterated on by 3 other people)

        - measure: survey, measuring self-rated cognitive effort, map quality, helpfulness of others' maps and their maps for others
