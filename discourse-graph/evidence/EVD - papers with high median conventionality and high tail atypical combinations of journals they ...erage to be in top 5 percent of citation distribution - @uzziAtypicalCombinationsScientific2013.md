    - results are robust to different cutoffs for novelty, up to 20th percentile on left tail

    - results also robust to different cutoffs for "hit" paper (1, 5, and 10)

- **Grounding Context**

    - __<describe how this result might be reconstructed/reproduced>__

###### Discourse Context

- **Informs::** [[QUE - How might domain distance modulate the effects of analogies on creative output]]
- **Supports::** [[CLM - There is a 'Sweet Spot' in Analogical Distance. Somewhat far analogies lead to better creative outcomes than very near or very far analogies]]
- **Supports::** [[CLM - Analogical distance of inspirations for an idea are positively related to the idea's creativity]]
- **Consistent With::** [[EVD - highly novel papers were more likely to be in the top 1% of citations in the long run, but not in the short run, and particularly in other fields - @wangBiasNoveltyScience2017]]
- **Consistent With::** [[EVD - highly novel papers had higher variance in their citation outcomes over a 15-year window, biased towards the higher impact tail of the distribution - @wangBiasNoveltyScience2017]]
- **Consistent With::** [[EVD - Molecular biologists with a reputation for innovation rarely used very far analogies in their...d mainly on analogies to the same or other biological organisms - @dunbarHowScientistsThink1997]]
