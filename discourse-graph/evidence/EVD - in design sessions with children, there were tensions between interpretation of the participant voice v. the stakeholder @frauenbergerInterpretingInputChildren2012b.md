- noteType:: [[EVD]]

    - ## Summary::

        - Researchers were challenged to represent the input from participants while considering their own experiences.

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F7_TvxIaFNM.png?alt=media&token=ea732311-3cd1-41ee-a3aa-8b44afe7df04)

        - In order to address tension between participants and stakeholders, recommend recognizing the multiple, potentially competing stakeholders that might overwrite the voice of the "primary stakeholders" (participants).

    - ## **Grounding Context**

        - What they did // **Method**

        - **What:** "Creative Workshop"

        - **Who:** Interdisciplinary team of researchers

        - **Goal:** To interpret the input of a yearâ€™s worth of PD work and converge the many disparate and complex requirements of ECHOES into a workable concept

        - **ECHOES:** To create a technologically enhanced learning environment to scaffold the social skill development of typically developing children and children with high functioning Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) or Aspergers Syndrome (AS).

        - Two Schools: one with 3 children with ASD; another with 30 typically developing children

        - Part of the ECHOES Projects

    - need to build rapport to help with the tension

        - good label for this is stakeholders - recognizing the multiple, potentially competing stakeholders that might overwrite the voice of the "primary stakeholders"

    - tension again with level of interpretation and faithfulness

        - > "We identified a key challenge in **faithfully representing input from participants while appreciating the value in our own experiences**. While in other contexts, the contribution of participants is more tangible, as they are directly co-designing the output, **the given context did not allow for this immediacy, and it fell to the designers to ensure that the input from our participants was upheld and shaped the outcome**. However, this **mediation or interpretation of input is prone to be unduly biased by the expectations and goals of the designers**. To mitigate this effect, we have developed a methodical approach to mindful interpretation that is grounded in the philosophical perspective of phenomenology." p. 2384 (Discussion)
