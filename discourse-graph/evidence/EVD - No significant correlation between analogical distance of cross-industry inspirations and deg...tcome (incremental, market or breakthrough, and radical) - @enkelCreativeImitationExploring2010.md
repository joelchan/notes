- # Summary

    - There was no significant correlation between [cognitive distance](Cognitive distance rating based on distance in the NACE classification of industries) of cross-industry inspirations and the [degree of innovation of the outcome](((axR0J0Bqr))) for the cases

        ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FUTpRbkXhrJ.png?alt=media&token=b8578a23-f595-443c-a9f4-86d71588e94e) (p. 11)

    - Most of the cases were drawn from other industries that were quite close by

    - None of the cases could be characterized as "incremental innovation" or pure exploitation of existing products; remaining were a mix of technological breakthroughs and radical innovations

- # Grounding Context

    - Sample: 25 cases from two year project and literature/Web publications, based on firms' acknowledgement of the case's 1) outstanding innovation performance and 2) involvement of cross-industry transfer

###### References

[[QUE - How might domain distance modulate the effects of analogies on creative output]]

- Admittedly underpowered correlational case study from industry: [[[[EVD]] - No significant correlation between analogical distance of cross-industry inspirations and degree of innovation outcome (incremental, market or breakthrough, and radical) - [[@enkelCreativeImitationExploring2010]]]].

    - Note: Most of the cases were drawn from other industries that were quite close by and ((E4MwwsilX)), so probably there is range restriction.

        - Telling that I previously classified this study as "anecdotal"! Yikes... This was a rigorously done multiple-case-study analysis.

        - 25 cases is also really really small for a correlation analysis.

        - I think the most we can say from this is an existence proof that relatively [[near analogies]] can frequently lead to quite innovative outcomes.
