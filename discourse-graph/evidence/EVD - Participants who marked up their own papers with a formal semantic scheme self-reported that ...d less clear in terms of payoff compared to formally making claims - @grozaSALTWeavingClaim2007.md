title: [[EVD]] - Participants who marked up their own papers with a formal semantic scheme self-reported that formally marking rhetorical relations between claims seemed less clear in terms of payoff compared to formally making claims - [[@grozaSALTWeavingClaim2007]]

- # Summary

    - The 8 authors perceived the easier elements of SALT (like [[rhetorical blocks]] and marking that a text fragment is a claim) more certain to payoff, but struggled more with more complicated things like noting explicit relations between rhetorical elements, and including "domain knowledge" (p. 206, Fig. 8b)

- # Grounding Context

    - The system consists of a markup scheme for denoting, with varying levels of complexity and specificity, what claims are in a given document.

        - Basically you want to mark claims (and supports) and relations between them, as well as "rhetorical annotation" (where in the document it is, e.g., abstract, methods, etc.)

            - claims and supports are similar to [[Stephen E. Toulmin]] claims and warrants

            - "nuclei" and "satellites" are generalizations of claims and supports

        - As far as I can tell, this markup doesn't really include any level of [[formality]] beyond the explicit marking that there is a claim/support, or relation between claims and supports.

        - Unfortunately, I have no idea, from the description, what the authoring experience is like at all!

            - Best I can tell is that inserting claims from __other__ papers uses markup similar to \cite in [[LaTeX]]

            - But I have no idea how you "mark" [[rhetorical blocks]] or claims/supports, or relations between them. In a separate "pop-up" interface?

    - They did a little user study with a group of 8 authors, had them try out the markup scheme on their own papers
