- noteType:: [[EVD]]

    - ## Summary::

        - video prompts seemed to work well for 2/3 cases (healthy eating and transport) observed, in part people responding to humor and resonance with the characters, and sparking many design ideas throughout the subsequent design process --

        - the authors thought this point was an especially important "secret sauce" of the [[sysOASIS design approach]]

    - ## **Grounding Context**

        - Research team tested a new design approach, the [[sysOASIS design approach]]

        - Their focus on older adults was to work with the full range of diversity of the 65+ age group. The researchers did not report specific demographic statistics or information about the older adults they worked with (from which their results are based), but they did report that their sample was more mobile than the typical older population

        - The Video Prompt method is based on an "invisible design" story format that never actually shows a specific device or discusses it. It is similar to the [[sysContraVision]]
