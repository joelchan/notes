- Summary::

    - Local developers evolved into a function of doing low-level technical work and support (e.g., writing macros, tech support, troubleshooting) in the patterns of cooperation among CAD users.

    - One particularly important aspect of this role is the "standardization" and dissemination of useful patterns amongst other end users in the organization.

        - Here is how the authors describe it

        - Here is how one of the informants describes it:

    - The main difference from general IT support is that they have domain expertise (similar to the end users they are supporting). most of them used to be end users but have now come into this role.

    - In some cases, the organizations turned this role into a formal or semi-formal one

    - The authors name this role "gardeners".
- **Grounding Context**

    - semi-structured interviews with 24 informants (21 users and 3 managers) who use the CAD system HP ME30 in the general fields of architecture, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and industrial design, across seveon companies of varying sizes. All informants had used the CAD system for at least five years.

        - Fictitious profiles of the informants:
