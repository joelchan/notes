        - Conducted PD with two groups of neurodiverse children from two different schools over the course of a school year (10 students; 2 teachers) approximately once every two weeks to design technologies that supported social play through the process of creating agonistic spaces (or Thinging technology) and turning conflict into design features. They created the two technologies called Music Pads and Light Spaces. (p. 4)
