- # Summary

    - Most (6 out of 9) biologically inspired designs were compound analogies (based on more than one biological analogy)

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F8AgfeeIhSQ.png?alt=media&token=b347087f-1eb7-4361-8a85-b614908d25c9) (p. 782)

    - They also observed iterative interplay between analogical transfer and problem decomposition and [[problem (re)formulation]]

        - simpler case where problem formulation was not influenced by analogs; existing problem decomposition was used to retrieve analogies and guid transfer

        - more complex case: no clear problem decomposition, analogs shape the problem decomposition

    - Example 1: eye in the sea - started with vague overall goal of stealthy underwater movement. an analogy to the copepod (which has two mechanisms of movement, slow and stealthy and fast), shaped a problem decomposition to think about having two modes of movement (slow and fast). one of these subproblems was unresolved from the analog, and an analogy to how squids move fast but stealthily, (jet propulsion) was transferred in for a compound solution

    - Example 2: invisiboard - started with vague overall goal of prevent silhouette; analogy to pony fish added subproblems of counter-illumination, producing light, and chaneling and dispersing light (some with partial solutions transferred over). the subfunction of producing light was unresolved, but modified by analogy to a brittle stir that harnesses ambient light, triggering a design based on collecting and distributing sunlight using lenses.

- # Grounding Context

    - general genre: in-situ observational

    - participants and setting: 45 students in a biologically inspired design course at georgia tech, fall 2006

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F8xBikSIxob.png?alt=media&token=5951b4d4-5e78-4dfc-ab57-2ac3e08067a8) (p. 781)

    - procedures: observed teams of 4-5 students, including one from biology and others from diff. enineering disciplines, worked on a design project from problem identification to final designs throughout the semester. collected data from classroom sessions, course materials, lecture content, and interactions in classrooms and in team work, with minimal intervention. projects targeted a variety of problems, including bullet-proof vests, traffic congestion, air filtratino, monitor screens, thermally adaptive fabric, and bomb detection
