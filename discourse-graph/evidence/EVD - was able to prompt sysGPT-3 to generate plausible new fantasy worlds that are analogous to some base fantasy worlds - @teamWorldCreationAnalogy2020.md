    - replicates and extends [[[[EVD]] - given one set of objects from a few classic analogies such as solar system / atom, [[sys/GPT-3]] was able to complete the corresponding objects on the other side for a few examples - [[@stayMachinamentaFormingExtended2020]]]]

    - NOTE: no sense of how often the new worlds generated were plausible!
