- noteType:: [[EVD]]

    - ## Summary::

        - The research team initially thought of doing a story-writing exercise to support value elicitation, but decided against it when the sister-survivors told them that they had very difficult negative experiences with writing their stories in the past

        - For this reason, the research team decided to go ahead with a photo elicitation activity that was focused on their current and future in a positive way

            - [[Elizabeth Bonsignore]]: this technique is generally effective and has been used in various other "participatory" situations, but not necessarily PD (e.g., [[m/Participatory Action Research]])

        - Participants: included members of a professional organization, and members of a survivor organization, as well as survivors of sex trafficking, who the team refers to as sister-survivors, in Nepal
