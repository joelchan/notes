- # Summary

    - Experiment 1a

        - Participants in the near analogy group were more successful when evaluating analogies than the far reaching analogies group which also took longer to correctly identify valid analogies

        - Analogies were displayed on screen and participants were asked to click left or right if the analogy was valid or invalid. The screen would display wrong if they got it wrong and too slow if they took more than 8 seconds
