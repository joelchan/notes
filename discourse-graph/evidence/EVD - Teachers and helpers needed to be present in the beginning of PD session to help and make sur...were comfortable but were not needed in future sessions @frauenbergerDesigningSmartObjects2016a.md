- Summary::

    - Researchers hosted solo design sessions with four neurodiverse children to develop a smart object unique to them and at the beginning of each session, a teacher would be present in the room during the design session. In all four cases it was determined that the teacher or helper was not needed after the first session.

- ## **Grounding Context**

    - The solo design session with four neurodiverse children took place over eight months. During the workshops, children designed smart objects unique to their likes and interests. The researchers "re-interpreted Future Workshops and Co-operative Inquiry to demonstrate that a) autistic children can lead processes with a deliberately open design brief and b) this leads us to explore design spaces that are un-imaginable for neuro-typical, adult designers."
