- Summary::

    - patenting teams with a greater number of prior patenting fields were more likely to generate patents that were technological outliers

    - breadth of experience appears to be additive: max individual breadth adds additional positive predictive value over and above collective breadth in the same model

    - results are robust to using higher threshold of four technological steps away from any previous patent (for defining outliers), as well as a continuous dependent measure of technological distance from previous patents

- **Grounding Context**

    - definition of outliers: patents that, at the time of filing, were at least two steps away from all preexisting patents in terms of the USPTO mainline subclasses. used this technique to classify ~1.5M patents filed between 1990 and 2000, of which ~120k (~8%) were outlier patents by this definition.

    - definition of distant recombination makes me a bit grumpy: it's a diversity measure rather than a distant measure: essentially the number of unique fields (per NBER 38 industry classifications) the inventor(s) (solo or team) had successfully patented within 10 years += year of application. collective breadth is total number of fields in the team, and max breadth is largest per-inventor count of fields.

    - estimation: logit (linear?) regression
