- # Summary

    - Statistically significant but small reduction in [total time, and illegal moves](General measures: transfer, as measured by reduction in total time, total number of moves, and total number of illegal moves, as measured by experimenter present) (283s to 162s, and 3.5 illegal moves to 2.2 illegal moves) when [undergraduates](((3i860x08_))) attempted to solve a [problem](((ObHMVIlWl))) after solving a previous analogous problem, with an [explicit mapping and reminder of solution from the analogous problem](((zhh_oEaik))), but only from the (slightly) harder to (slightly) easier problem
