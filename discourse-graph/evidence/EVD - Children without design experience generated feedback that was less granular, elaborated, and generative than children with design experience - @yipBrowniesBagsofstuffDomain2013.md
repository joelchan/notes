- Summary::

    - Children without design experience generated feedback that was less granular, elaborated, and generative than children with design experience

    - More "design-like" feedback from [[KidsTeam]] kids (more granular, elaborative,  and generative, "blue sky"), less granular (just likes/dislikes) from Kitchen Chemistry kids

        - granular vs. like/dislike

        - more generative/speculative

        - more ideas

    - Kitchen Chemistry kids also struggled with more complex design techniques like [[Layered Elaboration]], and issues with implicit stuff like giving negative feedback

    - Kitchen Chemistry kids also struggled to translate their expressed needs into design ideas.

- **Grounding Context**

    - participants: [[KidsTeam]] children and [[sys/Kitchen Chemistry]] children and adults

    - goal: co-design ScienceKit: integrated suite for communication, data collection, analysis and sharing tools

    - 3 design sessions over a ~year: 1) bags of stuff, 2) stickies, 3) layered elaboration

    - this bit about gap between knowledge and ability to express implementation/ideas calls to mind the [tension about layers of interpretation]([[[[CLM]] - There is a tension between analyzing participants' direct inputs, and respecting their actual insights (vs. designers' interpretation) that is intensified when working with design partners who struggle to contribute more directly to design artifacts]])

        - makes me think of the power of [[end-user programming]] as a paradigm for empowering expression
