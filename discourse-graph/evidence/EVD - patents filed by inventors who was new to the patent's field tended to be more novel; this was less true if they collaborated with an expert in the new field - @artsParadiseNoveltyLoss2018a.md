- Summary::
- Summary::

    - inventors who filed a patent in a new-to-them field tended to include more first-time combinations of patent subclasses in the patent

    - this was less true if they collaborated with an expert in the new field

    - similar results were found in a subsample of inventors who moved to new firms in a different field, during the Michigan Antitrust Reform Act: inventors who explored new fields also tended to create more novel inventions

- **Grounding Context**

    - study 1: correlational study

        - sample: ~400k inventors of ~2.7M patents, across ~47k firms

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FdyjoiND2vv.png?alt=media&token=7615e687-e83d-407d-8a19-494d2b216557)

        - estimation strategy: inventor-firm fixed effects panel models

        - dependent measure: novelty = number of pairwise subclass combinations in the focal patent that appear for the first time in the patent database

            - similar to [[@wangBiasNoveltyScience2017]]

        - dependent measure: "value" = number of forward citations in the 10 years after the patent is approved

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FmB38E0LsgV.png?alt=media&token=eee81c34-f24d-4e6e-bb1a-d431242edcc3) (p. 5)

        - independent variable: exploring new fields = 0 or 1 (if focal patent has no overlapping classes with all prior patents from the same inventor)

        - independent variable: expert team  = 1 if at least one co-inventor has prior patent with same class as focal patent (else 0)

        - sample: ~29k inventors of ~162k patents in michigan vs. not-michigan who filed patents after moving firms within the same state between 1975 and 1995 (+/- 10 yrs of MARA law passing)
