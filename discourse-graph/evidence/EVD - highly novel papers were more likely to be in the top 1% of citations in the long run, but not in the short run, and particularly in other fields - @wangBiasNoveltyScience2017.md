- Summary::

    - key figure:

    - novelty --> higher p(BIG HIT)  (5.2)

    - novelty --> bigger delayed recognition penalty (lower p(hit) in short run, higher p(hit) in longer run, past 7 years) (5.4)

    - novelty --> greater impact from (more) distant fields (5.3)

- **Grounding Context**

    - sample: 661,643 papers published in 2001 from 251 subject categories, retrieved from  [[Web of Science]]

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FVYIDxSOBLg.png?alt=media&token=7c165565-4a9e-466c-af5d-5f14a16d78a9) (p. 4)

    - novelty = difficulty-adjusted first-time combination of journals

        - novelty per paper is sum over journal pairs binary novel/not multiplied by cosine distance between the co-citation vectors of the journal

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FkcP0aTxEQZ.png?alt=media&token=74d3a02c-c7e8-4368-bdf9-41671c3dee31)

        - difficulty is proxied by the cosine similarity between the co-citation vectors of the journals

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FHHLCWvv1L4.png?alt=media&token=784a0747-d383-4b08-bd51-903e6693dac3)

        - filter out journals that don't really get citations (er.... whyyyyyy if more novel papers tend to get published in lower impact factor journals on average). pay close attention to Appendix III

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F0Gkaoda-lr.png?alt=media&token=e22d1308-f7c2-4e10-af0a-4cab485716f3)

        - in this sense, it could be related to [[far analogies]], but perhaps more closely to [[ðŸ§± conceptual combination]]

        - why might journals be a reasonable proxy for conceptual chunks? domains?

            - better than keywords? (maybe too granular?)

            - or subject areas? (maybe too coarse?)

                - some have used [[MeSH]] headings.

                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2Fu-fHUaHEJU.png?alt=media&token=1d010c7d-505f-4af5-aea7-087e8877b43e)

                    - might depend on there being a reasonably complete and high-quality ontology or controlled vocabulary

            - [[@uzziAtypicalCombinationsScientific2013]] makes the same move (journals as proxies of bodies of knowledge)

    - for analysis, novelty was binned into three categories (no novelty, >= 1 novel combination, but overall score < 99th percentile for subject category, >= 99th percentile for subject category) due to a highly skewed distribution

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2Fyhp_0sx_40.png?alt=media&token=298a87ad-d5f2-4616-ae87-f5bc5ad942d3)

        - not sure about this; would like to see robustness checks with a different estimation strategy. but ok i guess.

    - properties of novelty score: as expected, highly skewed (~89% of papers do not make novel combinations, and ones that do only score modestly after difficulty adjustment)

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FrbtFk4kNEa.png?alt=media&token=a5a76e16-a2b8-475a-a74b-8610cbebfde5) ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2Fsc2n6w-OiT.png?alt=media&token=e56f301d-a632-4a5b-81e4-5e4e30adef60) (p. 4)

    - results robust to categorical conception of novelty, as well as filtering of sample (see 5.7)
