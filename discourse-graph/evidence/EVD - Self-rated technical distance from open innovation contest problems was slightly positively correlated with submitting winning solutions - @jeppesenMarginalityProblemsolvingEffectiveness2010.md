- Summary::

    - [Solvers](Participants: 320 out of 993 solvers who responded to the survey) who chose to submit their solutions to the 2nd stage of an innovation contest and [self-rated themselves as more technically distant from the problem domain](((LtwnesPYh))) were slightly more likely to submit winning solutions for [Innocentive science problem solving contests](((OztGD5jl4)))

    - Note: the effect size is small: roughly 3% increase in odds of submitting winning solution, for every 1 unit increase on the 7-point self-rated scale of technological distance

        - for comparison, the effect of being female (their proxy for [[social marginality]]) was almost an order of magnitude bigger!
- ## **Grounding Context**

    - Design: two-stage: some choose to submit solution (993 out of 13k), estimate likelihood of submission; then some choose to

    - [[c/Independent variables]]

        - Measure for expertise distance (here called "technical marginality"): self-reported on 7-point scale (1 inside your field of expertise, 4 at boundary, 7 outside your field)

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F47I_68s_5U.png?alt=media&token=ad486e06-47e9-45cd-b41e-c7cd062bd652)

            - mean is quite low, about 2.9 on 7 point scale for the 2nd stage
