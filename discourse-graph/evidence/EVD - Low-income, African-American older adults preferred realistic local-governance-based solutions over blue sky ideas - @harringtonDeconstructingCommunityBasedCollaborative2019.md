- noteType:: [[EVD]]

    - ## Summary::

        - [Codesign participants](Setting for first case study: PD workshops aimed at health needs / priorities / solutions amongst 12 members of a residential community of low-income, African American, older adults in Chicago) [wanted to brainstorm more realistic ideas](((83JOKv-Go))) that respected their resource constraints and were closer to resources they could control, rather "out of the box" ideas that ignored these constraints or relied on resources from researchers or local governance. An example of this sort of idea was a resident petition to be issued to housing authority committees.
