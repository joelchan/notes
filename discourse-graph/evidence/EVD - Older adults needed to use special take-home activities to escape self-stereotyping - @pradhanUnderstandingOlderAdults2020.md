    - ## **Summary**

        - [take-home](multi-stage PD sessions, with "take-home" journal and camera activity to bring to final session) journal and camera [activity](((qJ9dT-GxC))) helped to move [older adults](((xDXm4o9PP))) [away from stereotypes](((EDc9EWvey))) of their own needs (expressed in the first session before the take-home activity) to expressing and co-designing for their real needs (in the second session after the take-home activity). [Examples of](((aWH59NkS9))) "stereotypical" needs included a strong focus on health and medical reminders in the first session; in contrast, examples of more diverse needs included a smart bulleting board for monitoring utility usage, exercise prompters, and communication devices.

        - here are some representative quotes from the participants explaining that they were thinking of design ideas for "generic" older adults as a population, not themselves, in the first session

            - >  On the surface, these attempts to ensure a common interest by defaulting to the needs of the stereotypical older adult seemed to result in a topic – medication reminders – that was raised and affirmed as a topic of interest, generating a significant amount of discussion in the first workshop. But when we conducted follow up interviews, we found that this discussion did not reflect real needs for all participants. P4 tried to “relate to people [others in her group]” by sharing difficulty she had remembering a new medication from a drug trial research study after P1 asked if anyone had issues remembering their medications. However, she had no issues with her “normal meds.” P6, who actually initiated the discussion of medication reminders in the workshop she was in (W1-B), confessed in follow up interview: “I wasn't very excited about it in the first day…I thought it would be a good idea and useful. I took care of my elderly mother who had lots of medications.” [P6, follow up]. Rather than thinking about what she might need or want, P6 approached the first workshop discussion in terms of what might be useful for other older adults – in this case, her own elderly mother. ^^Instead of stemming from a real need or personal interest, participants in the first workshops thought about what might be appropriate for older adults as a population^^.
