- # Summary

    - [Senior mechanical engineering students](participants: 25 senior mechE students at Texas A&M) who [were shown an example](((wifdfiVqs))) (flawed, with flaws stated) design for a bike rack were approximately 2X more likely to [include key features from the example design](((EhzLUIP8e))) in [their own brainstormed designs](((I6nlnuhu7))), compared to students who didn't see the example; both sets of students generated similar numbers of total design ideas

    - a few other problems, and [also for professionals]([Professional structural design engineers](((ThoPyJe5b))) who [were shown an example](((XNP7iOLs5))) (flawed, but flaws not stated) design for a disposable coffee cup were approximately 2X more likely to include key features from the example design in [their own brainstormed designs](((vlqhHRHsI))), compared to engineers who didn't see the example; both sets of engineers generated similar numbers of total design ideas) (though not domain experts; structural design doing product design)

    - #appraisal NOTE: the N is really small (~12 per cell in a between-subjects), and we aren't given information about the coding procedure (why these three features of the example design? who coded them, with what reliability?), and no statistics are run, so by itself this isn't very strong result.

        - although the raw numbers are quite high (I believe these are proportion of all designs, vs. average of proportions per subject, which is also kind of sketchy)
