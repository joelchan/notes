- # Summary

    - [Senior mechanical engineering students](participants: 25 senior mechE students at Texas A&M) who [were shown an example](((wifdfiVqs))) (flawed, with flaws stated) design for a bike rack were approximately 2X more likely to [include key features from the example design](((EhzLUIP8e))) in [their own brainstormed designs](((I6nlnuhu7))), compared to students who didn't see the example; both sets of students generated similar numbers of total design ideas
