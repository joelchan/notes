- This reminds me very much of [[[[EVD]] - Children from underserved communities were often unable to attend in-lab PD sessions due to travel and time constraints - [[@walshEquityEqualityAmerican2018]]]], which literally had the same thing about extracurricular sports.

    - I wonder about the changing significance of these activities as you move between socioeconomic and other dimensions of marginalization - how "optional" are these?
