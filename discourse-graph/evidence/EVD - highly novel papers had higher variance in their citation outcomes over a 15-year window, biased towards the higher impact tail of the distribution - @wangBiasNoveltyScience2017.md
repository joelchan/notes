- **Informs::** [[QUE - How might domain distance modulate the effects of analogies on creative output]]
- **Supports::** [[CLM - Analogical distance of inspirations for an idea are positively related to the idea's creativity]]
- **Consistent With::** [[EVD - papers with high median conventionality and high tail atypical combinations of journals they ...erage to be in top 5 percent of citation distribution - @uzziAtypicalCombinationsScientific2013]]
- **Consistent With::** [[EVD - highly novel papers were more likely to be in the top 1% of citations in the long run, but not in the short run, and particularly in other fields - @wangBiasNoveltyScience2017]]
