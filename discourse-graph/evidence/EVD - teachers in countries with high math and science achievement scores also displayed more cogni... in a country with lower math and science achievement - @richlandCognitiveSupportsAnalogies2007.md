- # Summary

    - teachers in countries with high mathematics and science achievement test scores (Hong Kong and Japan) also displayed more cognitive supports for analogies, such as [[bridging analogies]], and visuospatial scaffolds for comparison, compared to teachers in a country with lower math and science achievement (USA)

- # Grounding Context

    - selected comparison between Hong Kong and Japan vs. USA for contrast in TIMSS scores

    - classes were 10 ~50m class periods randomly sampled from each of classes in United States, Hong Kong, and Japan [[Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS)]]
