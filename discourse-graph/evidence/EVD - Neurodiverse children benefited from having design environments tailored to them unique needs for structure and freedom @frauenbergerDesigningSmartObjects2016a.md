    - ## Summary::

        - Children with Autism did not react the same way to the freedom to develop their own ideas as children without disabilities and needed tailored structure to support PD efforts. (p . 7)

    - ## **Grounding Context**

        - The solo design session with four neurodiverse children took place over eight months. During the workshops, children designed smart objects unique to their likes and interests. The researchers "re-interpreted Future Workshops and Co-operative Inquiry to demonstrate that a) autistic children can lead processes with a deliberately open design brief and b) this leads us to explore design spaces that are un-imaginable for neuro-typical, adult designers."
