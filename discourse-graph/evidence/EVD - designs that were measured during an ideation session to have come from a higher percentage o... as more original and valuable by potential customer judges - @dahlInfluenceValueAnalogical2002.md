- noteType:: [[EVD]]

    - ## Summary::

        - a linear regression finds that the percentage of far analogies used by [senior engineering students](participants: 119 senior engineering students with at least two courses in design) for a [new product design task](((KNGLwVZkz))) is [positively correlated](((XP0W7URT3))) with both [judged originality and willingness to pay](((o7EpOki0N))) (B = .05 and .11, respectively, both p < .05). The magnitude of these effects is smaller (in the case of originality, about 3x smaller) than the *negative* effect of being given one or more near analogies as stimuli

        - problem: design new products for the commuting diner

        - participants: 119 senior engineering students with at least two courses in design

        - design: 2 (asked to access single or multiple domains) x 3 (given no, single, or multiple [[near analogies]] as primes)

            - access strategy: instructed to try to access one or multiple domains for analogies

            - primes: none, single, or multiple

                - all were within domain

                    - drive-in window food try for single

                    - cup holder, lunch box, and airplane foldout table for multiple

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FdyLCwcqvCI.png?alt=media&token=008a9062-9f6c-4946-8e37-e73b80963832)

        - measures:

            - % far analogies, judged in a binary way by two independent coders, 95% agreement; base rate and imbalance not reported

                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FUGQ6RFzQPJ.png?alt=media&token=eba18182-a198-4bd8-a093-e4aa458e0af1)

                - really wish we had descriptive stats here

            - originality and willingness to pay

                - 16 potential customers provided judgments for each design on 3 7-point scales (originality, innovativeness, creativity), then summed into a single originality index. alpha for originality is ~.82, none reported for willingness to pay.

                - mirrored procedure from study 1

        - limitations:

            - this result is observational/correlational even though it came from an experiment, since the independent variable here is observed, rather than manipulated directly

            - The analysis approach has significant weaknesses: the regression is done on design-judgment pairs (vs. designs, or designers) as the units, which does not correct for or model potential dependencies within designs or designers. A more appropriate modeling approach would be a repeated measures one, such as a [[generalized linear mixed model]] that modeled these dependencies directly. No measures of variability/error in the estimates were given either (e.g., confidence intervals).

            - We also do not know the descriptives of the measures: what constitutes a low or high percentage of far analogies, and how many designs were produced for each designer, whether there were significant between-designer variations in analogy use (plausible given research on individual differences in analogical performance, such as [[@kubrichtIndividualDifferencesSpontaneous2017]] and [[@cushenBothAttentionalControl2018]])

- on its own it is a bit of a reinforcement of the negative effect of given near analogies observed in [[[[EVD]] - designs that were measured during an ideation session to have come from a higher percentage of far analogies were perceived as more original and valuable by potential customer judges - [[@dahlInfluenceValueAnalogical2002]]]]

    - also very similar to [[ðŸ§± fixation]] effects found in [[@janssonDesignFixation1991]]: [Senior mechanical engineering students](((L9Pert3wW))) who [were shown an example](((wifdfiVqs))) (flawed, with flaws stated) design for a bike rack were approximately 2X more likely to [include key features from the example design](((EhzLUIP8e))) in [their own brainstormed designs](((I6nlnuhu7))), compared to students who didn't see the example; both sets of students generated similar numbers of total design ideas

- the main result of interest for our question is the correlation between the observed dependent variable of % far analogies: [[[[EVD]] - designs that were measured during an ideation session to have come from a higher percentage of far analogies were perceived as more original and valuable by potential customer judges - [[@dahlInfluenceValueAnalogical2002]]]]

    - it's an odd choice to control for expert judge effects by making them dummies, but... ok i guess? more sensible might be to aggregate the judgments somehow. the worst thing here is that the analysis seems to be at the judgment level, not even at the design level, and i don't understand how they would compute % far at that level??? and there are no corrections or attempts to model within-design (bc these are repeated measures) OR within-person (also repeated measures) dependencies

    - this is a weak result overall, imo. i would probably have complained as a reviewer, and asked to see degrees of freedom, and/or descriptives. the relatively high p value and small effect (with no measures of variability given) make me quite nervous.

    - in any case, it's really important to note here that the far analogies were *NOT* given to the designers in a controlled fashion as stimuli, as in [[@chanBenefitsPitfallsAnalogies2011]] and similar, BUT were observed and correlated with a suboptimal statistical modeling approach. so this is essentially an observational correlational result.
