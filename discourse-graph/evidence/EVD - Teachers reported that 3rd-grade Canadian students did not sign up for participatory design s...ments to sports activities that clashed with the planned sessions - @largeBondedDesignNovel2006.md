- # Grounding Context

    - Context: two intergenerational teams (3 researchers across all, one with eight Grade 6 students, one with six Grade 3 students), operating in a public elementary school in a middle-class Canadian suburb, designing Web portals to find information for class-based projects. The design project was informally perceived as a success in terms of the output design prototype being preferred to Google/MSN by the users (no formal eval yet).
