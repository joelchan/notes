- # Summary

    - the starbucks environment for baristas is characterized by lots of multi-tasking and coordination with orders fulfilled by multiple steps, each often done by different baristas at the same time as other orders, in a tight space, with interruptions

    - the paper cup:

    - the size of the cup eliminates need to remember size; position of cup in queue next to espresso maker directly encodes queue position; markings on cup also preserve mapping between order and customer name

    - paper cup reduces variance in quality, doesn't necessarily make things faster. part of this is improving error recovery, and another part of this is reducing cognitive effort for more complex tasks

        - core idea of variance vs. raw efficiency/speed

        - improve error recovery by enabling better task resumption after an interruption due to reifying task state

        - reduce cognitive costs of complex orders by encoding information on the cup itself

- The design pattern of the central manual index and queue is beautiful its simplicity, and its manual, situated (one place) nature reminds me of... the humble [Starbucks coffee cup as a distributed cognition facilitator]([[[[EVD]] - Starbucks baristas used a paper cup to support complex coordination to reduce the cost structure of creating complex drinks in a tight, multi-tasking and interruption-intensive environment - [[@kirshMultitaskingCostStructure2005]]]])

    - The index and queue acts as a forcing function to not grow the inbox endlessly. Practice the discipline of letting go.

    - And it is very much inspired by [[Matt Clancy]]'s simple practice
