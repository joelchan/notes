- Observation: hints of Darwin's theory of man were visible in his notes far earlier than the public expression of the theory: [[[[EVD]] - Charles Darwin's ideas about the evolution of man existed in quite well-developed form in his notebooks 34 years prior to their publication in the Descent of Man - [[@gruberDarwinManPsychological1974]]]]

    - Q: Why did it take so long to publish?

        - Competing answers (probably a bit of both)

            - V unfavorable climate

            - #Claim Darwin's theory wasn't ready much earlier than 1871, even though the sketches and broad outlines were in place from as early as 1837

                - Evidence: key nuances and evidence missing in his thought by 1859; important developments between 1861-1871, as seen in the notebooks.

        - Very important implications for [[V: Open and Sustainable Innovation Systems]] and [[[[CLM]] - Prevailing incentives in academia are bad for science]]: Darwin was essentially working on this full-time. Still took that long! Could he have gone faster? Gruber isn't so sure (see preface, and especially [[Chapter 6]] on the rate of cognitive change)

    - How many years were between the first expression of [[Charles Darwin]]â€™s ideas about man and their final development in Descent of Man?  [[[[interval]]:748.4]] [[[[factor]]:3.05]] [[July 24th, 2023]]

        - Quite well-developed ideas in notebooks between 1837-1838; Descent of Man was published in 1871, about ^^34 years later^^!
