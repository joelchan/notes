- Summary::

    - Older adults found it difficult to engage productively with a design topic around personal security

    - For example, video prompts, which [worked well for a few other topics]([[EVD - Older adults responded well to the use of video prompts to frame discussion about invisible future technologies - @lindsayEngagingOlderPeople2012b]]

    - Also during low-fidelity prototyping, the sessions for personal security systems were difficult to make productive; there seemed to be tensions and discomforts around disclosure

        - cc [[EVD - Sex trafficking survivors shared concerns about painful experiences from writing their storie... elicitation method seemed to be a viable alternative - @gautamParticipatoryTensionsWorking2018]]

        - the authors seem to think that making the groups smaller could be a way to manage this when working with sensitive topics

            - i think this ends up being cited by some later work as justification for smaller sample sizes (see [this DIS paper from 2019](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3322276.3322317))

            - this coudl definitely be in tension wtih teh goal of breadth/diversity - needing smaller groups especially with marginalized populations due to extra attentino needed for managing dynamics???
- ## **Grounding Context**

    - Research team tested a new design approach, the [[sysOASIS design approach]]

    - Their focus on older adults was to work with the full range of diversity of the 65+ age group. The researchers did not report specific demographic statistics or information about the older adults they worked with (from which their results are based), but they did report that their sample was more mobile than the typical older population

    - The Video Prompt method is based on an "invisible design" story format that never actually shows a specific device or discusses it. It is similar to the [[sysContraVision]]

    - The Exploratory session component was structured and derived from the Task Analysis Framework, and involved 15 minutes of information gathering, 10 minutes of prompt viewing, 20 minutes of scenario generation, 20 minutes of claims analysis, 30 minutes of feature envisioning, and 30 minutes of scenario envisioning
