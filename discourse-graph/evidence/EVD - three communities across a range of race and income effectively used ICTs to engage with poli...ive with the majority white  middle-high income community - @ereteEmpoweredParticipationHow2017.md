    - i think the flip side here is to note the equality in skill of engagement that pushes back against assumptions that they wouldn't be able to speak for themselves (e.g., [[[[CL]] - There is a tension between analyzing participants' direct inputs, and respecting their actual insights (vs. designers' interpretation) that is intensified when working with design partners who struggle to contribute more directly to design artifacts]])
