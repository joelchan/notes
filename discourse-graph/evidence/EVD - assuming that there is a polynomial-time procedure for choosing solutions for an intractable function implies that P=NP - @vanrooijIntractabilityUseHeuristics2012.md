- Summary::

    - if we assume that P != NP, and a function f is intractable, claiming that we have any polynomial-time procedure for solving f (by tractably choosing from a finite set of tractable heuristics) implies that P=NP ([[reductio ad absurdum]])

- i am very skeptical that there is a general solution to this (see, for example [this proof by van Rooij]([[[[EVD]] - assuming that there is a polynomial-time procedure for choosing solutions for an intractable function implies that P=NP - [[@vanrooijIntractabilityUseHeuristics2012]]]]), and [this claim]([[[[CLM]] - intractable problems cannot be solved by a fixed number of parallel procedures - [[@vanrooijIntractabilityUseHeuristics2012]]]])), but curious about local solutions to this, per [[meta-rationality]]: are there relatively stable heuristics, and are there variations in stability/maturity across settings?

    - even if there aren't "rational" and useful general solutions to the demarcation problem

- And per [[[[EVD]] - assuming that there is a polynomial-time procedure for choosing solutions for an intractable function implies that P=NP - [[@vanrooijIntractabilityUseHeuristics2012]]]], it doesn't really make sense to define hard boundaries for science in terms of process

    - I think this is [[Paul Feyerabend]]'s point?

        - If we do, the risk of descending into [[Cargo Cult Science]] is SUPER HIGH
