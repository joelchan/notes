- noteType:: [[EVD]]

    - ## Summary::

        - Designers would analyze the results of meetings and make assumptions based off the analysis on how to design the next prototype. This would lead to a disempowerment of the participants with Dementia.

    - ## **Grounding Context**

        - Authors conducted workshops with dementia groups and agencies to identify participants with moderate cases of dementia.

        - Workshop Participants - no more than 6 people with dementia and 6 - 8 caregivers.

        - Researchers selected two participants from the workshops to continue working with a tailored design process.

        - Participants - Two people with mild dementia who were engaged in the design process during the workshop and their caregivers.

        - location - Participants hoes in United States

        - marginalized population - people with dementia

###### Discourse Context

- **Informs::** [[QUE - What tension points exist between the goals of diversity and depth of user participation in participatory design]]
- **Supports::** [[CLM - Marginalized user populations may require involvement of extra stakeholders who may complicate hearing the users' voices]]
- **Supports::** [[CLM - There is a tension between analyzing participants' direct inputs, and respecting their actual... when working with design partners who struggle to contribute more directly to design artifacts]]
- **Consistent With::** [[EVD - in design sessions with children, there were tensions between interpretation of the participant voice v. the stakeholder @frauenbergerInterpretingInputChildren2012a]]
- **Consistent With::** [[EVD - Sex-trafficking survivor organization staff members would sometimes speak of and for the survivors when talking about their needs - @gautamParticipatoryTensionsWorking2018]]
