- # Summary

    - 29% of students had a conceptualization of upwards force going into the study

    - After the study students were asked to re-rank their belief ratings of upward force and it showed that students had altered their prior beliefs, showing that the bridging analogies were helpful in altering their conceptions of force.

    - All Students by the end of the study were able to explain why they don't fall through the floor using upward forces as a basis, and 12 of the [participants](semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 physics students, 15 male and 6 female) were able to conceptualize on a deeper level.

    - Students were split into 3 groups

        - group 1 which had prior knowledge of Newton's third law

    - They asked participants questions after showing the analogies to demonstrate to what extent they were able to transfer their knowledge

    - Students were provided four analogies that demonstrate force concepts and were asked questions in order to assess conceptual changes in their thinking.
