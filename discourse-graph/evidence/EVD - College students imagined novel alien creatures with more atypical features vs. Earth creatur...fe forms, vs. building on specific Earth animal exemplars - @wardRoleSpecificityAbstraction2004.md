    - College students imagined novel alien creatures with more atypical features vs. Earth creatures when they were instructed to consider survival-critical features of life forms, vs. building on specific Earth animal exemplars

- # Grounding Context

    - Participants: 284 psych subject pool participants

    - Procedure: draw alien creatures

    - Design: 1) exemplar condition (think of specific exemplars of earth creatures, and design based on that) vs. 2) abstract principles (think of higher order principles associated with survival of life forms) vs. 3) control (no special instructions). Abstract principles condition were given information about survival goals (sensing, nutrition, protection from danger, and reproduction)

    - Coding of drawings, achieved ~90% agreement between coders
