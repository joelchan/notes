- Summary::

    - In-situ prototypes were needed to enable genuine design input from local marginalized users, which required creative adaptations to the prototypes

- **Grounding Context**

    - setting here: ~60 participants across stakeholder groups for problem of rural water management in Uganda, over the course of roughly a year.

    - initial intermediary was a community learning facilitator from an international NGO that had previously funded projects in the communities. the NGO had to leave bc their funding ended and they couldn't secure more funding. next intermediary was a water officer from local government.

    - project involved situational analysis, first workshop (initial needfinding), second workshop (collaborative design, with reflections and outputs and high-fidelity prototype), third workshop (with initial prototype + training), formative evaluation after using prototype for 6 months (through semi-structured interviews with individual users) and fourth workshop (clarifying feedback from deploy). workshops varied from 2-3 days of ~6 hrs each.
