- # Summary

    - groups given low-related categories of solutions ended up exploring more categories in their solutions compared to high-related category groups

- # Grounding Context

    - group problem solving

    - sample: ~150 undergrads in intro psych, randomly assigned into 3-person groups

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FPJwNROQNls.png?alt=media&token=4b9fba5b-e76f-4bae-ac19-6869946de6a6)

    - task and materials: brainstorm on the problem of how to improve university. each group given 3 broad topics related to university, drawn from 11 categories: classes, campus-activities, food, buildings, teachers, technolgoy, parking, campus-safety, addition-construction-revnoation, student-welfare and campus beautifuaction. experimter rated parwise how related (IRR = .93), then high related = 5, and low related = 1

        - higher level of granularity, no signal on "quality" of stimuli given

    - each person is individual, collaborate over Yahoo Messenger System

    - design: 2 (both teammates focus on the same category, vs. focus on different) x 2 (low related vs. high related categories)

    - dv = quant, felxibility, clustering, within-category fluency, originality (not sure how this measured)
