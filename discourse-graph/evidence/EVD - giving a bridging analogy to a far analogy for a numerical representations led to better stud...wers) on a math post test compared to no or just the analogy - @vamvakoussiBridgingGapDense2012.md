    - main result: rubber line (bridging analogy) >> basic and figure

    - Students scored higher on the 5 items given after the number line questions when provided the rubber band line text

    - Students given the rubber line example were also more apt to explain their answers using the provided analogy or be able to explain the solution better than students given the non-rubber line text

- # Grounding Context

    - 140 8th and 10th graders in Athens, Greece

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F3vALBeV5jJ.png?alt=media&token=fd506a67-078d-4dd6-811c-114d785c4a4f)

    - Three stimuli were provided to the students. T1 was text based, T2 was figured based, and T3 contained the rubber band(number line) analogy

    - A pre-test and a post-test were given

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FJzPxJVfXsc.png?alt=media&token=bc6c23b5-ebf2-4252-8e23-b83181ac1159)

    - Students first received the pre-test. Upon completion was handed the text for their classroom and after the text was given took the post-test.
