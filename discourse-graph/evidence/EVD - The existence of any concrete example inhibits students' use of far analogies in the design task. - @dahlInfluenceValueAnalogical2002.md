###### Discourse Context

- **Supports::** [[CLM - The originality of the resulting product design is influenced by the extent of analogical transfer, the type of analogies used, and the presence of external primes.]]
- **Consistent With::** [[EVD - Encouraging the access of multiple base domains during the idea-generation stage can improve design originality in the absence of an external prime. - @dahlInfluenceValueAnalogical2002]]
- **Consistent With::** [[EVD - Student subjects who are encouraged to access multiple base domains in the design task will a...an will those who are encouraged to access only one domain. - @dahlInfluenceValueAnalogical2002]]
- **Consistent With::** [[EVD - The percentage of far analogies had a statistically significant, but small, positive effect on originality of designs generated by students. - @dahlInfluenceValueAnalogical2002]]
- **Consistent With::** [[EVD - The external prime (example) reduced design originality by structuring the form of the design. - @dahlInfluenceValueAnalogical2002]]
- **Consistent With::** [[EVD - Student subjects in the no prime (example)multiple base of analogies condition produced desig...w and wo primes and single basemultiple bases of analogies. - @dahlInfluenceValueAnalogical2002]]
- **Consistent With::** [[EVD - The states when an idea was generated in the form of an analogy were shown by verbal protocols to play a prominent role for all four design teams. - @dahlInfluenceValueAnalogical2002]]
