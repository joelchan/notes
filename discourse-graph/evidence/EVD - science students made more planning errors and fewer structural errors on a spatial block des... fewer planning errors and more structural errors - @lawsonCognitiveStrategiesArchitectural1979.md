- [[@lawsonCognitiveStrategiesArchitectural1979]] [showed]([[SupportedBy]]) from a [[m/Think-aloud protocols]] study that [[[[EVD]] - science students made more planning errors and fewer structural errors on a spatial block design task; architecture students made fewer planning errors and more structural errors - [[@lawsonCognitiveStrategiesArchitectural1979]]]]

    - Looking more closely at [[@lawsonCognitiveStrategiesArchitectural1979]] alone, I'm not certain about this claim yet. In that study, the task they worked on didn't clearly tap any prior knowledge, so it can't really be explained by "I'm defaulting to solutions because I have a good sense of what might work in this domain", although the task was

        - Also, the designerly vs. scientist approach led to stronger performance on different problems, and different patterns of errors.

    - inferred from this that there is a contrast between "designerly" and "scientific" approach: [designers are solution-oriented]([[[[CLM]] - Expert designers are solution-oriented]]) (find solutions that work), scientists are problem oriented (try to discover structure of the problem)

    - architecture students performed worse than science students on problem variants that relied on having a good grasp of the rule (disjunction rules)
