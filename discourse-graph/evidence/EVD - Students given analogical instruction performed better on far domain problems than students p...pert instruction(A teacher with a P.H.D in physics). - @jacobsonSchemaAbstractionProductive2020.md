- # Summary

    - Students in the two model group performed better on questions which were not related to a near domain regardless of teacher instruction.

    - Students in both groups performed better on the posttest than the pretest

    - Participants in the one model groups performance was dependent on the teacher's expertise, which is in opposition to the the two model group who performed as well as the other groups without being dependent on teachers expertise.

- # Grounding Context

    - Participants / setting

        - 114 participants were recruited from an all girls high academic achieving school in Australia.

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F9SpvcDYDcV.png?alt=media&token=3cbc160d-2d6a-4116-a6ec-a5c83c4063d9) (Pg 3)

    - Design

        - A two model group was given problems to solve in both climate change and weather systems, and were also given problems from outside domains.

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F9SFy03C0cI.png?alt=media&token=94594068-e570-45d8-8d3a-f7d5de5bf20b) (Pg3)

        - A control group was given problems as well, but they were limited to the problems about climate change and weather systems.

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2Filt8HtmM99.png?alt=media&token=16b8f8c5-5121-4919-8ff0-4f54c0e3f4e4) (Pg3)

        - The students were a guidebook to provide instructions for the problems and then were given teacher led instruction on the concepts. The one model group received instruction on climate  change and the weather systems, while the two model group received instruction on the climate change and weather systems in addition to concepts which related to prior concepts.

    - Task/Procedure

        - Study was conducted over 6 class periods. One one each day. The first class was for the pre-test, the 4 following were for solving problems and instruction and the last was for the post-test

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FcVBQ3YcdZW.png?alt=media&token=d3063489-7d46-4947-b89d-a7d9a862d9f4) (Pg 4)

        - Classes lasted for 80 minutes and were broken down into one 20 minute phase for exploration and ideation, one consolidation phase which was 20 minutes and the knowledge assessment phase for 40 minutes.

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2Fm0vkIFcn6G.png?alt=media&token=08a5ddb4-23e5-4b88-ba80-79ced377f012) (Pg 5)

    - What did they measure (to analyze)?

        - Since the problems were open ended written responses a rubric using a scale of 0-3 was used to score responses. Two raters were used to assess accuracy with inter related reliability at 97%.

    - How they analyzed (what statistical approach)

        - Used McDonald's w to assess declarative knowledge, Greater Lower Bound to assess explanatory knowledge and Cronbach's alpha to assess test reliability.
