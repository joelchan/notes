- Summary::

    - In contrast to when ICTs were not available and offline (official townhalls and civic meetings) being the primary venue for influencing local policy and governance, developing online participation options for civic input diversified and strengthened participation in Chicago neighborhoods

    - For example, ~80% of interviewees noted that other obligations, such as a second job, sickness, or lack of transportation, made it difficult or impossible to attend civic meetings, which made them feel like they didn't have a voice. This changed for many of them, who used the ICTs as a replacement/supplement to traditional input channels.
