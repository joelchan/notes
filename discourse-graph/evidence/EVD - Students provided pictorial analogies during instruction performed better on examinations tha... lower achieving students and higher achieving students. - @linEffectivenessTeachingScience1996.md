- # Summary

    - The adjusted mean of the control group was lower than that of the experimental group

    - Low achievers made a more significant increase in their adjusted scores than the high achievers did.

    - In order to ensure that treatments provided were effective and not just attributed to teaching styles exams were looked at and shown that the treatment did have an effect on students scores

    - Students in the experiment group performed better on the term examinations when provided the pictorial analogy treatment

- # Grounding Context

    - 225 Year 8 students(8th graders?) from a school in Taiwan participated in the study.

    - Students were assessed on their understandings o concepts determined before the study by the researchers

    - Students were provided a test with four open ended essay questions.

    - There were 6 classes who participated. Three teachers provided the material. One teacher taught the same as they always had not using analogies, and two teachers taught using analogies.

    - Three science educators graded the tests of the students. The inter correlational coefficients ranged from .933-.95
