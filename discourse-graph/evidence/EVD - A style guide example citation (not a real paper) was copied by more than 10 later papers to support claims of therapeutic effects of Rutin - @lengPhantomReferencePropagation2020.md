            - [[@harzingPersistentMythHigh1995]] is another really striking example, arguing that "there is almost no empirical foundation for the existence of high failure rates when measured as premature re-entry. The persistent myth of high expatriate failure rates seems to have been created by massive (mis)quotations of three articles. Only one of these articles contained solid empirical evidence on expatriate failure rates and in fact showed them to be rather low"

                - the author followed up on this with some more analysis later and showed that the problem had gotten worse, not better [[@harzingAreOurReferencing2002]]
