- Summary::

    - Engineering students who were given one or more near analogies as stimuli generated design ideas that were perceived as less original (B=-.13, p < .05 for one prime, B=-.16, p < .01 for multiple primes) and valuable (B=-.14, p < .05 for one prime, B=-.15, p < .01 for multiple primes) by potential customer judges, compared to being given no stimuli

- **Grounding Context**

    - problem: design new products for the commuting diner

    - participants: 119 senior engineering students with at least two courses in design

    - design: 2 (asked to access single or multiple domains) x 3 (given no, single, or multiple [[near analogies]] as primes)

        - access strategy: instructed to try to access one or multiple domains for analogies

        - primes: none, single, or multiple

            - all were within domain

                - drive-in window food try for single

                - cup holder, lunch box, and airplane foldout table for multiple

    - measures:

        - % far analogies, judged in a binary way by two independent coders, 95% agreement; base rate and imbalance not reported

            - really wish we had descriptive stats here

        - originality and willingness to pay

            - 16 potential customers provided judgments for each design on 3 7-point scales (originality, innovativeness, creativity), then summed into a single originality index. alpha for originality is ~.82, none reported for willingness to pay.

    - limitations:

        - this result is observational/correlational even though it came from an experiment, since the independent variable here is observed, rather than manipulated directly

        - The analysis approach has significant weaknesses: the regression is done on design-judgment pairs (vs. designs, or designers) as the units, which does not correct for or model potential dependencies within designs or designers. A more appropriate modeling approach would be a repeated measures one, such as a [[generalized linear mixed model]] that modeled these dependencies directly. No measures of variability/error in the estimates were given either (e.g., confidence intervals).

        - We also do not know the descriptives of the measures: what constitutes a low or high percentage of far analogies, and how many designs were produced for each designer, whether there were significant between-designer variations in analogy use (plausible given research on individual differences in analogical performance, such as [[@kubrichtIndividualDifferencesSpontaneous2017]] and [[@cushenBothAttentionalControl2018]])
