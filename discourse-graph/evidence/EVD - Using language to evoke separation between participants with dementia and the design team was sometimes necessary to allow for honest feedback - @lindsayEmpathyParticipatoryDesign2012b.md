- ## Summary::

    - Participants at times were reluctant to engage in critiquing of prototypes. When a natural division arose between the designers and the participants with their researchers, using terminology such as we(Participants) and them(designers), participants were more responsive to engaging.

- ## **Grounding Context**

    - Authors conducted workshops with dementia groups and agencies to identify participants with moderate cases of dementia.

    - Workshop Participants - no more than 6 people with dementia and 6 - 8 caregivers.

    - Researchers selected two participants from the workshops to continue working with a tailored design process.

    - Participants - Two people with mild dementia who were engaged in the design process during the workshop and their caregivers.

    - location - Participants hoes in United States

    - marginalized population - people with dementia
