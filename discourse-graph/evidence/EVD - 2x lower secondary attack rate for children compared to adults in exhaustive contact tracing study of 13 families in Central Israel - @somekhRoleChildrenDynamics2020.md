[[QUE - How susceptible are young children to COVID-19 infection, given equivalent exposure]]

- Household contact studies are also important if testing is exhaustive and index cases are caregivers, since contact patterns with potential infectious individuals would be *higher* for children! And here we still frequently see lower [[secondary attack rate]]s [[@somekhRoleChildrenDynamics2020]([[[[EVD]] - 2x lower secondary attack rate for children compared to adults in exhaustive contact tracing study of 13 families in Central Israel - [[@somekhRoleChildrenDynamics2020]]]]), [@jingHouseholdSecondaryAttack2020]([[[[EVD]] - 30 percent lower household secondary attack rate for children vs. adults, ~2x lower than older adults, in Guangzhou - [[@jingHouseholdSecondaryAttack2020]]]]), [@liCharacteristicsHouseholdTransmission2020]([[[[EVD]] - 5x lower secondary attack rate for children compared to adults in households in China - [[@liCharacteristicsHouseholdTransmission2020]]]])].

    - This set is particularly important because the studies also include exhaustive testing of close contacts in addition to some ability to equate for exposure (same household).
