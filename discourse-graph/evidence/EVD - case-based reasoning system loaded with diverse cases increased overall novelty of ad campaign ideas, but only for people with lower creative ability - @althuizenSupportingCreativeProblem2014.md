        - CBR system: can search by lots of different variables, including general information, problem (aspects), solution (aspects), and outcomes. NOTE: only display top 10 more similar to query in a traditional search system results

    - measure: creative ability with [[measure/Abbreviated [[Torrance Test]] for Adults]]

    - measure: **novelty** (originality, surprise, and uniques from [[measure/Creative Product Semantic Scale]]) and **usefulness** (effectiveness, fit, attractiveness, and usefulness, adapted from [[measure/Creative Product Semantic Scale]]), rated independently by three experts, [[Cronbach's Alpha]] > 0.86
