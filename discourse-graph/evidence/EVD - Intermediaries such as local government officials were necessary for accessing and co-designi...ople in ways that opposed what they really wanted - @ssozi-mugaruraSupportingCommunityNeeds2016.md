- Summary::

    - Intermediaries such as local government officials were necessary for accessing and co-designing with marginalized populations (serving roles of "human access points, champions, or gatekeepers"), but the intermediaries sometimes spoke for the people in ways that opposed what they really wanted

    - NGOs and gov institutions may be necessary, for sustainability reasons: some users may lack power and resources to sustain solution, so those with power and resources need to be involved somehow. this can get complicated, i imagine!

- **Grounding Context**

    - setting here: ~60 participants across stakeholder groups for problem of rural water management in Uganda, over the course of roughly a year.

    - initial intermediary was a community learning facilitator from an international NGO that had previously funded projects in the communities. the NGO had to leave bc their funding ended and they couldn't secure more funding. next intermediary was a water officer from local government.

    - project involved situational analysis, first workshop (initial needfinding), second workshop (collaborative design, with reflections and outputs and high-fidelity prototype), third workshop (with initial prototype + training), formative evaluation after using prototype for 6 months (through semi-structured interviews with individual users) and fourth workshop (clarifying feedback from deploy). workshops varied from 2-3 days of ~6 hrs each.
