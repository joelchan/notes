- Summary::

    - Overall: within-domain analogies dominated (~80% of analogies)

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FgUSzzN6V3q.png?alt=media&token=3b7b9263-8860-4ddf-bf70-8770cca58fec) (p. 4)

        - This is similar to [[[[EVD]] - Molecular biologists with a reputation for innovation rarely used very far analogies in their lab meetings while generating novel scientific concepts; instead, they relied mainly on analogies to the same or other biological organisms - [[@dunbarHowScientistsThink1997]]]]

    - [No differences](![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FgUSzzN6V3q.png?alt=media&token=3b7b9263-8860-4ddf-bf70-8770cca58fec) (p. 4) ) in percentage raw occurrence of [far analogies](((EzWeayFHm))) between psychology lab group and colloquia [settings](((7hyP0twIO))), but [stark difference in **use* of far analogies](((4KruoVeqG))): none of the far analogies in lab group were actually [used](((mNl82ZWlp))), but 71% of far analogies in colloquia were (vs. equal likelihood, ~30%, of usage for near analogies in both settings)

        - p = .02 by [[Fisher's exact test]]

        - this is very similar to [[[[EVD]] - Molecular biologists with a reputation for innovation rarely used very far analogies in their lab meetings while generating novel scientific concepts; instead, they relied mainly on analogies to the same or other biological organisms - [[@dunbarHowScientistsThink1997]]]]
- ## **Grounding Context**

    - setting: two psychology lab groups and one colloquium series at a major research university in North America (over 100 faculty, students, postdocs, and research assistants; colloquium series presenters from around the world)

        - core contrast between lab group meetings vs. colloquia  rests on assumption that lab group meetings are early/in-progress, vs. colloquia (late/finished, similar to historical record)

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2Ffi_ymscgpG.png?alt=media&token=b762dce0-f4ca-4de0-87bd-3e4dc04bb457) (p. 2)

    - sample: three ~70-90 min colloquia sessions (one speaker + ~30-60 audience members from department; all 3 speakers were senior researchers, well-known, two from other universities) in social psych, cognitive psych, and cognitive neuropsych + five ~70-90 min lab group meetings from two different lab groups (one in developmental psych with 10 scientists: two faculty, three postdocs, three graduate students, and two research assistants; one in cognitive psych, with 19 scientists: three faculty, six postdocs, five graduate students, and five research assistants)

    - measure: analogy yes/no - yes if compareing similarity/dissimilarity of two things in a structural or functional sense; no if x is attribute of y, or x is-a (instance of) y (e.g., "x is a connectionist system"). IRR is .90

        - note: might leave out metaphors

    - measure: analogy within-domain vs. not ([[far analogies]]): domain is defined as psychology, bc couldn't reason through systematic way of distinguishing between domains?

    - measure: analogy use vs. mere mention: use if analogy is used to illustrate or substantiate a point, or to draw a further inference; no if no followup to mention
