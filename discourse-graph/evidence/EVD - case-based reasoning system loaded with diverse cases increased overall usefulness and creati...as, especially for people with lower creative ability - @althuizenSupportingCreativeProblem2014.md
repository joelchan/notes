- # Summary

    - case-based reasoning system loaded with diverse cases increased overall usefulness and creativity of ad campaign ideas, especially for people with lower creative ability

        - overall main effect of having system on usefulness and creativity

        - looks like system closes the gap between (and even flips advantage of??) creative ability? or... only low creative ability benefit from cases

        - negative interaction effect - higher creative ability, smaller effect of system
- # Grounding Context

    - task: write proposal for a Dutch brewery to boost brand loyalty and enhance brand image

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FuWPf2KKoGC.png?alt=media&token=61efbc0e-a30b-47ca-8054-4464469a7630)

    - design: with case-based reasoning system (loaded with mix of 50/50 near vs. far award-winning campaigns from Europe in 1980s-1990s), compared to no system. but both conditions got an inventory of basis sales promotion techniques (+ pros/cons fo techniques), taken from textbooks

        - inventory

        - CBR system: can search by lots of different variables, including general information, problem (aspects), solution (aspects), and outcomes. NOTE: only display top 10 more similar to query in a traditional search system results
