###### Discourse Context

- **Informs::** [[QUE - What factors control whether people appropriately benefit from analogies (especially far-field ones) during creative problem solving]]
- **Supports::** [[CLM - People are more likely to benefit from analogies if they encounterprocess them with an active goal or license to use them for inspiration]]
- **Consistent With::** [[EVD - direct comparison of dissimilar analogs approximately doubled rates of spontaneous far analogical transfer for the radiation problem - @gickSchemaInductionAnalogical1983]]

    - Results were similar to [[@gickSchemaInductionAnalogical1983]]. The number of convergent solutions produced increased with the introduction of a hint.
