- noteType:: [[EVD]]

    - ## Summary::

        - Researchers used physical objects when prototyping to allow participants to have a concrete object to help aid in memory recall. What they found is that participants had a tendency to become hyper-focused on an irrelevant aspect of the design.

    - ## **Grounding Context**

        - Authors conducted workshops with dementia groups and agencies to identify participants with moderate cases of dementia.

        - Workshop Participants - no more than 6 people with dementia and 6 - 8 caregivers.

        - Researchers selected two participants from the workshops to continue working with a tailored design process.

        - Participants - Two people with mild dementia who were engaged in the design process during the workshop and their caregivers.

        - location - Participants hoes in United States

        - marginalized population - people with dementia
