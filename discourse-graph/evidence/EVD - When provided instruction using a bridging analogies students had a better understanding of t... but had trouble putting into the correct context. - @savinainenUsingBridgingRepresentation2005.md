- # Summary

    - The results of the pre-test showed little difference, however, the students taking the post-test having seen the analogy of the sliding block performed better on the post-test.

    - A higher percentage of students had a contextual understanding of Newton's third law across all tests except the pre-test.

    - During the extended writing portion 82% of the students answered correctly which supports the given tests results, however even with an incorrect response students still were able to demonstrate a correct understanding of what the law is, just not the correct context.

    - When asked questions during an interview 3 out of 5 answered the questions correctly. One answered a question correctly, but misunderstood the context and one answered both questions incorrectly.

- # Grounding Context

    - 23 16 year old Finnish students participated in the study.

    - A prior study of 22 students were involved in a similar study.

    - Students had access to a textbook and were taught the concepts by the same teacher, However the study group had access to a diagram which showed a block sliding on a table

    - Students in the study were given a pre-test, a post-test, interview questions, a written response, and a survey during the study.

    - Student responses were measured using 4 points that if met decided they met the criteria for contextual coherence.
