- # Summary

    - Noticing parity as an important feature of the representation was way easier when the board was presented in a way that made parity salient (e.g., bread and butter need to be paired, so you notice when there's more of one than the other; but you don't necessarily think blank squares or different colored squares *need* to be paired).

    - This was measured in terms of time to first mention of parity, where bread and butter boards led to faster mentions of parity, compared to black and pink boards, which were in turn faster than blank boards. Participants who got more salient boards (vs. blank) also solved the problem faster, and spent less time trying fruitless approaches

    - Participants experienced insight after noticing that parity is important to the problem representation (solution followed quickly after) (p. 388)

    - A simulation in the [[SOAR]] cognitive architecture also demonstrates that attending to the parity feature of the problem representation yields rapid solutions quickly after
- # Grounding Context

    - Participants: 25 CMU undergrads in intro psych, with no prior experience with problem

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2Fm1CHLm1_M6.png?alt=media&token=badbb145-1b9d-42af-806a-4a829b182863) (p. 385)

    - Task: [[Mutilated Checkerboard problem]]

    - Design: varied the type of board they were working with, from blank to colored, to color-named (black and pink), to bread and butter on each square. the idea was to vary the salience of parity (or the lack thereof) between the types of squares

    - Procedure: given board, allowed to draw on it, and given hints at four intervals: 1) tell them the solution is that it's impossible, and you need to prove it, 2) tell them the proof is easier if you abandon exhaustive search as a thing (this and previous given at the same time at 15 mins in if Ss still trying covering solutions), 3) tell them to attend to the colors/words (~15 mins after first two hints), and lastly 4) tell them to count the number of each type of square (if they hadn't solved it in 40 mins)

    - Dependent Measure: time to "rough proof"

    - Manipulation check: 20 Ss ranked the bread and butter as most unusual/salient in its features, followed by the colored ones (both color and words about equal), and then blank
