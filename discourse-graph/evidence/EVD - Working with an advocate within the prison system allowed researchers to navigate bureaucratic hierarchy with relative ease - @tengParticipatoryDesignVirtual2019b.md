- noteType:: [[EVD]]

    - ## Summary::

        - In order to get final designs for the VR headset approved researchers had to get approval from the prison system. They partnered with an advocate who was well established within the hierarchy which made it much easier for the researchers to get approval and navigate issues when they arose.

- In particular, there's something similar here in the following observation and [[@tengParticipatoryDesignVirtual2019b]]'s observation of the [need for an advocate]([[[[EVD]] - Working with an advocate within the prison system allowed researchers to navigate bureaucratic hierarchy with relative ease - @tengParticipatoryDesignVirtual2019b]]):

    - [Issues with obtaining consent](![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2Ff3Om-CxLTN.png?alt=media&token=6c96ef43-9dfb-4b32-97a2-1729fb91f933) pg 437) from [children](((slZCVGK1p))) presented a challenge being that there were no parents at the libraries with the children. The IRB met and came to the conclusion that being that no harm could come to the children consent wouldn't be required but that a consent form would be sent home with the children.
