- # Grounding Context

    - Design: have people do two blocks: in second block people got a lot btter, so probably best to consider block 1 to really feel out the ffects of problem types

        - Vary problem difficulty by varying constraint hardness and chunk tightness, both together and independently

[[@knoblichConstraintRelaxationChunk1999]]

- Evidence for this: [[[[EVD]] - People were ~2x worse at solving matchstick arithmetic problems when the elements were harder to decompose into chunks - [[@knoblichConstraintRelaxationChunk1999]]]] when they made it harder to decompose chunks (even with identical constraint types), people were about half as likely to solve the problem (p. 1540).

    - Said another way

        - Impeding [[chunk decomposition]] makes it harder to overcome [[Impasses]] during [[Insight problem solving]]
