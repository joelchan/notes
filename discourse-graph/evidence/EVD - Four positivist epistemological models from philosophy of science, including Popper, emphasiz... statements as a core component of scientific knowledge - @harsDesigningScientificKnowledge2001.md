- **Summary**

    - Statements were a core building block of a model of scientific knowledge synthesized from four [[Positivist]] epistemological models of scientific knowledge from philosophy of science [[@popperLogicScientificDiscovery1959]] [[@nagelStructureScienceProblems1979]] [[@dubinTheoryBuilding1978]] [[@bungePhilosophyScience1998]]   #Atomicity

    - Excludes critical/interpretivist bc less implications for representation/data models (debatable) (p. 65)

    - Selection criteria for epistemology texts: 1) broad and comprehensive, and 2) had an impact on practice of research. But I don't see how this selection criteria is borne out in the selected texts, except maybe [[@popperLogicScientificDiscovery1959]]; no evidence is provided to support the claim that these selected texts meet the stated criteria. So I'm going to put a big asterisk on this until I can confirm it with other stuff. The good thing is that the core statement about statements does sort of pass the smell test, by being consistent with other lines of evidence.

        - [[Mario Bunge]] sort of passes the smell test by having some presence on the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] (across [105 documents](https://plato.stanford.edu/search/searcher.py?query=mario+bunge) related to philosophy of science). That doesn't address the second criteria though, although perhaps only in a loose way.
