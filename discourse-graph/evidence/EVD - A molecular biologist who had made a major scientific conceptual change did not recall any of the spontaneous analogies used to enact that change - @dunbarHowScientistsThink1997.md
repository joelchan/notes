- Summary::

    - Researcher observed analogies used in the construction of a major conceptual change in a molecular biology lab; the postdoc who engineered that change (alongside others in a lab meeting) [was not able to recall](![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FPGOl3p2KzJ.png?alt=media&token=3dee907b-fd27-481f-bd86-53dc22af53fd)) any of the analogies involved when asked a week, month, 3 months, and 9 months later. [[[[EVD]] - In a design team, concepts tended to be more similar to their immediately preceding concepts after far analogy use compared to using near or no analogies - [[@chanImpactAnalogiesCreative2015]]]]

- **Grounding Context**

    - Participants and Setting: 25 scientists (ranging from technicians/grad students to postdocs to senior scientists) across 4 molecular biology labs from a single major university, all with a reputation for innovation

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FqbaLiIoQYr.png?alt=media&token=1dbad6ba-8118-451a-8e66-744f1ea36614)

        - Lab A: major discovery (during observation period) of how cells proilferate into certain regions of hte body

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FyWxjZZhkHk.png?alt=media&token=431a1e7c-e225-444a-bef9-e3b08f03990f)

        - Lab B:

        - Lab C: major breakthroughs from the research pojrects covered in obs period, pubs in major journals like science

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FrsAKyu8poV.png?alt=media&token=98f68803-de8f-4ba5-99e5-72eb39302b0a)

        - Lab D:

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FqKGVDieV6R.png?alt=media&token=1a414ff1-8a8a-43fa-8d5e-b1966de59c6d)

        - Identified in consultation with a Nobel-Prize winner

    - Procedure is sort of [[m/Ethnography]]: spent a year embedded inÂ in the labs, directly observing and audio-recording laboratory meetings, supplemented by reading grant proposals and drafts of papers, and conducting interviews with the scientists. The observation period spanned 19 research projects, many of which led to major discoveries.

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2Fl5gy57KBtI.png?alt=media&token=c11fb5ef-2e72-42e1-a3bb-73d9aa368cac) (p. 464)

    - The observation method was a kind of "before-during-after" design: interview before (focusing on current state of hypotheses, data, and next steps), audio-video tape during lab meeting, and interview after (focusing on how the lab meeting affected their knowledge). The overall focus was on understanding the emergence of new and significant scientific "concepts"

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FlMV-auO5Hk.png?alt=media&token=1d068dec-a9c0-4e20-a8f6-848aaad2b46d) (p. 465)

    - Examples of new concepts and discoveries included discoveirng a new gene that controls cell differentiation, an explanation for cell proliferation to certain regions of the body (this one was actually caught on tape)

    - Positionality: spent 3 months setting up relationship, and had free access to the labs and to interview anyone, attend meetings, read all materials, etc.

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FhTTN8uBXs3.png?alt=media&token=de96b2d7-9c9a-4ad9-8219-0fff10864aec) (p. 466)

    - General coding approach: extension of [[m/Think-aloud protocols]] to group setting: unit of analysis is a "statement" (clause or sentence, with a verb phrase that they assume indicates the core mental operation emplyed). Transcription was done by two students with backgrounds in the domain (molecular biology)

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2Fi40jtMd3yO.png?alt=media&token=a5179466-da4c-4cef-9a52-a719c6cda808) (p. 468)

    - Measure: analogy use (by distance): [within-organism (e.g., HIV to HIV)](![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2FOx_9m-j5QC.png?alt=media&token=e0ce51e4-e42d-4b52-82eb-c502d8fe368e)), [other-organism (e.g., Ebola to Herpes)](((ALEzpeGMK))), and [nonbiological/distant (e.g., monkey typing shakespeare to PCR)](((oQITT-eu2))). Mere statement of similarity not enough: must include use (e.g., to explain, modify a concept)
