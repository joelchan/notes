    - connects with [extra stakeholders]([[[[CLM]] - Marginalized user populations may require involvement of extra stakeholders who may complicate hearing the users' voices]]) thing, particularly how the interests might not be aligned

    - but also very very reminiscent of what we saw with harrington:

        - [[[[EVD]] - Low-income, African-American older adults were reluctant to share sensitive health information bc of past mistreatment in research studies by the university hospital - [[@harringtonDeconstructingCommunityBasedCollaborative2019]]]]

        - [[[[EVD]] - Black and LatinX codesign participants distrusted researchers from the local university due to perceived abandonment after past research studies - [[@harringtonDeconstructingCommunityBasedCollaborative2019]]]]

    - and also ssozi: [[[[EVD]] - Intermediaries such as local government officials were necessary for accessing and co-designing with marginalized populations, but the intermediaries sometimes spoke for the people in ways that opposed what they really wanted - [[@ssozi-mugaruraSupportingCommunityNeeds2016]]]]
