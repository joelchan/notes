- # Summary

    - Experiment 2

        - Participants given analogy texts as opposed to summaries demonstrated higher learning gains

        - Concepts included in the essays participants wrote were statistically comparable to across both text conditions

        - Analogy text readers exhibited fewer misconceptions in their essays than the summary based group

        - Participants given the analogy texts displayed a more self inference explanations, while the summary participants had more of a tendency to paraphrase information and present surface connections which did not add information

        - Participants in the analogy group presented more valid self inference explanations than summary group

        - No statistical evidence that participants in each processed the story differently

- # Grounding Context

    - Experiment 2

        - 18 participants were selected using the same process as [experiment 1](Experiment 1), except the only people chosen were those who had prior knowledge about the source domain

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F3B-g_nd83_.png?alt=media&token=4ecf50a9-ed26-4a0e-9523-36a265fc72c7) (Pg 464)

        - Materials were the same used in [experiment 1](Experiment 1)

        - Participants were met with individually and were asked to think aloud while reading the provided text material

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2F4rrGIw0vWN.png?alt=media&token=8d159e04-4e8a-47b5-9e40-da4ab79b05d0) (Pg 465)
