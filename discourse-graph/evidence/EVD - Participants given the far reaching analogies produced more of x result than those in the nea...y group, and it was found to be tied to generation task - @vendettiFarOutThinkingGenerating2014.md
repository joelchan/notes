- # Summary

    - Experiment 1b

        - Participants generated more accurate responses in generating solutions to verbal analogy problems

        - Participants in far reaching analogy groups provided more relational responses on the picture mapping task.

        - Have to come back and look at this to understand this result

- # Grounding Context

    - Experiment 1b

        - 54 undergraduate students at the UCLA Psychology department participated in the study

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmegacoglab%2Fq2mE2hWH8-.png?alt=media&token=8ae0edf1-8fe0-4023-bb08-5faca5ae3957) (Pg 930)

        - Students were first asked to complete the RAPM(Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices) to proved a measure of fluid intelligence

        - They then participated in the same task as [Experiment 1a](Analogies were displayed on screen and participants were asked to click left or right if the analogy was valid or invalid. The screen would display wrong if they got it wrong and too slow if they took more than 8 seconds), however only valid(near) analogies were presented.
