title: [[EVD]] - Two artists used individual artworks to shape not just their ideas, but used a process of "analogical modification" to search for and modify higher-order concepts, and their creative vision. This process unfolded over the course of years. - [[@okadaAnalogicalModificationCreation2009]]

- # Summary

    - The artists studied abstracted an evolving undersatnding of their creative process (their "generating function") from individual artworks. The components of this overall udnerstanding included expressive techniques (e.g., erase the main character, duplicate), super-ordinate concepts (e.g., erase the meaning, continuity), and creative vision (e.g., "How should the world be viewed?"). Some of this modification happened through analogical comparison and abstraction of these elements. Okada calls this overall process of development "analogical modification".

    - Two studies of two contemporary artists, Shinji Ogawa and Kenji Sugiyama (procedures are the same), spanning ~3-4 years of observations, including ten interviews, each about 3h long, in the artists' studio, and recorded (they called this a "portfolio interview")
