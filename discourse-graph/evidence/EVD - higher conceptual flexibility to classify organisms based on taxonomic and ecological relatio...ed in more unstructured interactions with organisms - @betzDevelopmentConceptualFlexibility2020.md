- # Grounding Context

    - participants:

    - task: sort cards of species on a table, then explain why they formed each group

    - measure: conceptual flexibility = change in percentage of taxonomic vs. ecological pairs and explanations from a general card sort to a "triadic" sort that focused on either taxonomic or ecological properties (shared internal features vs. shared environmental interaction)

    - gave activities survey about their hobbies and activities, including pet ownership, gardening, zoos, parks, etc. - coded and classified into unstructured vs. structured via factor analysis
